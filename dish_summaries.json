    "Aloo Dum": " Dum aloo (also spelled as dam aloo, Hindi: \u0926\u092e \u0906\u0932\u0942, romanized:\u00a0dam \u0101l\u016b), aloor dum (Bengali: \u0986\u09b2\u09c1\u09b0 \u09a6\u09ae, romanized:\u00a0\u0101l\u016br dam) or aloo dum (Odia: \u0b06\u0b33\u0b41 \u0b26\u0b2e, romanized:\u00a0\u0101l\u016b dam) is a potato-based curry dish. The word dum translates to as steam-cooked or slow-cooked, while aloo means potato.[1] It is a part of the traditional  Kashmiri Pandit cuisine,[2][3] from the Kashmir Valley, in the Indian state of Jammu and Kashmir. Dum aloo is cooked widely in India and Pakistan.[4] There are also Banarasi and Bengali variations.[1] The potatoes, usually smaller ones, are first skinned and deep fried.[5] Kashmiri dum aloo sauce is made with yogurt or khoya, and often includes a cashew nut paste.[5] The Banarasi variation sauce is typically more aromatic and is made from tomatoes and onions.[6] Spices such as red chilies, garlic, ginger, cardamom, and fennel along with other herbs, are added to the sauce.[7][8]  The potatoes are cooked slowly at low flame in the sauce, and can be garnished with coriander.[9][10] Dum aloo is often paired and served with naan.[6]  This Indian cuisine\u2013related article is a stub.

    "Almond Milk": " Almond milk is a plant-based milk substitute with a watery texture and nutty flavor manufactured from almonds,[1] although some types or brands are flavored in imitation of cow's milk.[2] It does not contain cholesterol or lactose and is low in saturated fat. Almond milk is often consumed by those who are lactose-intolerant and others, such as vegans, who do not consume dairy products. Commercial almond milk comes in sweetened, unsweetened, vanilla and chocolate flavors, and is usually fortified with micronutrients. It can also be made at home using a blender, almonds and water.[3][4] Global almond milk sales in 2018 were US$5.8\u00a0billion, growing at 14% per year, and forecast to be a $13\u00a0billion global market by 2025.[5] Almond milk was used as a substitute for animal milk in the Middle Ages in areas that followed Catholic fasting doctrines. Historian Carolyn Walker Bynum notes that: ... Medieval cookbooks suggest that the aristocracy observed fasting strictly, if legalistically. Meat-day and fish-day recipes were not separated in medieval recipe collections, as they were in later, better-organized cookbooks. But the most basic dishes were given in fast-day as well as\nordinary-day versions. For example, a thin split-pea puree, sometimes enriched with fish stock or almond milk (produced by simmering ground almonds in water), replaced meat broth on fast days; and almond milk was a general (and expensive) substitute for cow's milk.[6] Almond milk's popularity as a dairy substitute continued throughout history, going well into modern times. It is even mentioned under the secondary definition of \"milk\" in Samuel Johnson's Dictionary in 1755, alongside pistachio milk.[7] In the United States, almond milk remained a niche health food item until the early 2000s, when its popularity began to increase. In 2011 alone, almond milk sales increased by 79%.[8] In 2013, it surpassed soy milk as the most popular plant-based milk in the US.[9] As of 2014 it comprised 60 percent of plant-milk sales and 4.1 percent of total milk sales in the US.[10]:\u200a2\u20133 Manufacturers and distributors of animal milk have advocated that plant-based milk not be labelled as \"milk\". They complain that consumers may be confused between the two, and that plant-based milks are not necessarily as nutritious in terms of vitamins and minerals. In the United States, as of 2021,  though the USDA is investigating and various state legislatures are considering regulation, various courts have determined that reasonable consumers are not confused, and the FDA has enacted no regulations against plant-based milk labels.[11] European Union regulations require \"milk\" to be used for animals only, except coconut milk. (See Plant milk \u00a7\u00a0Labeling and terminology.) Within the Italian regions of Sicily, Apulia, Calabria, and Campania, almond milk is a protected traditional agricultural product.[12] Brands include Almond Breeze, Elmhurst 1925, Mooala, Silk and Kirkland Signature. Non-human milks are fortified If unfortified, almond milk has less vitamin\u00a0D than fortified cows' milk; in North America, cows' milk must be fortified with vitamin\u00a0D, but vitamins are added to plant milks on a voluntary basis.[18] Vitamin E is released from the almonds and absorbed. The positive effects of the vitamin E includes strengthening the cells.[19] Because of its low protein content, almond milk is not a suitable replacement for breast milk, cows' milk, or hydrolyzed formulas for children under two years of age.[20] The general production method involves soaking and grinding almonds in an excess of water. A milky white liquid is obtained after filtering the almond pulp (flesh). Almond milk can also be made by adding water to almond butter. In commercial production, almond milk is homogenised with high pressure and pasteurised for greater stability and shelf life.[21] Almond milk can be stored in the fridge in an air-tight container (preferably a glass container) for about 4-5 days. However, certain factors, such as the temperature of the refrigerator, sterilization of the blender or storing jar, and surface cleanliness, can decide how many days you can keep it fresh. Storing homemade almond milk for more than a week may reduce its nutrition or even make it unhealthy.[22] In July 2015, a class action lawsuit was filed in New York City against two American manufacturers, Blue Diamond Growers and White Wave Foods, for false advertising regarding the small quantity of almonds (only 2%) contained in the final product.[23][24][25][26] In October 2015, a judge denied the plaintiff's request for an injunction.[27] Almond production in California is concentrated mainly in the Central Valley,[29] where the mild climate, rich soil, and abundant sunshine and water supply make for ideal growing conditions. Due to the persistent droughts in California in the early 21st century, it became more difficult to raise almonds in a sustainable manner.[30][31] Almond sustainability is challenged because of the high amount of water needed to grow almonds: a single glass of almond milk requires roughly 74 litres (16\u00a0imp\u00a0gal; 20\u00a0US\u00a0gal) of water to produce.[28] Among plant-based milks, almond milk requires substantially more water during the growing and production stages than soy, rice or oat milk (graph).[32][28] Dairy milk requires more water to produce than almond milk (graph).[28] In 2014, California produced 42.3\u00a0billion pounds of cow's milk and only 2.14\u00a0billion pounds of almond milk.[33][34] Sustainability strategies implemented by the Almond Board of California and almond farmers include:[31][35][36]",
    "Aloo Gobi": " Aloo Gobi, alu gobi or aloo gobhi (pronounced [\u00e4\u02d0lu\u02d0 go\u02d0b\u02b1i\u02d0]) is a vegetarian dish from the Indian subcontinent made with potatoes (aloo), cauliflower (gobhi), and Indian spices.[2] It is popular in Indian cuisine.[3] It is yellowish in color due to the use of turmeric, and occasionally contains black cumin and curry leaves. Other common ingredients include garlic, ginger, onion, coriander stalks, tomato, peas, black pepper, asafoetida and cumin. There are a number of variations and similar dishes.

    "Avial": " Avial (Malayalam: \u0d05\u0d35\u0d3f\u0d2f\u0d32\u0d4d\u200d, pronounced [a\u028bijal]) is an Indian dish with origins in the state of Kerala of India. [1] It is a thick stew of usually 13 vegetables commonly found in the Western Ghats and coconut, seasoned with coconut oil and curry leaves. Avial is considered an essential part of the main meal in Kerala (oonu in Malayalam) and is also served as a delicacy in South India.[2] Central Travancore has a slightly different variety of avial with its thin gravy whereas the classic avial is thick. Generally, only crisp vegetables are used in avial. Vegetables commonly used in avial are elephant foot yam, plantain, ash melon (wax gourd), carrots, beans, brinjal (aubergine), cucumber, drumstick pods, snake gourd and broad bean, etc. are the recent introduction, while the Avial from the Kozhikode region includes bitter gourd. Variants of avial from the Kollam region also includes tomato among other vegetables. Some people prefer to skip curd or replace it with raw mango or tamarind pulp. This dish can be made into a gravy or be made into a semi-dry side dish. It is generally eaten with rice. The word \"avial\" is also used to denote 'boiled' or 'cooked in water' \u2014 this sense being derived from the way the dish is made. Avial is believed to have been invented by the warrior Bhima during his exile. According to the legend, when Ballava\n(Bhima's name during this time) assumed his duties as the cook in the kitchen of Virata, he did not know how to cook. One of the first things he did was to chop up many different vegetables, boil them together and top the dish with grated coconut. [3][4]\nThere are mythological variations. Bhima is said to have prepared Avial, when there were unexpected guests for King Virata and he needed to serve meals for them. There were no sufficient vegetables to cook any single recipe for a side dish, so Bheema used whatever available vegetables to make a new dish, which came to be known as Avial. Another narrative version relates to the attempt made by Kauravas to kill Bhima. After poisoning Bhima, Kauravas tied Bhima and threw him into the water. Kauravas also communicated that they saw Bhima drowning in water. With the completion of the days of mourning, a funeral feast was planned and preparation were underway. Unexpectedly, Bhima emerged from the water, rescued by the Nagas. With this, preparations for the feast was cancelled. However, Bhima was unhappy with this decision, and decided to mix all of the vegetables to prepare a new dish which later became popular as Avial. Another popular old story is that in the Kingdom of Travancore in Kerala there was a great feast held by the king. Every one in the kingdom came to eat so there was a shortage of curry to be served. But in the kitchen also stocks were less so when the king visited the kitchen he found that a lot of vegetables were wasted when they were peeled. The king ordered the cook to make a curry with this along with some other ingredients so Avial was born. The king also ordered it to be served as the first item. Hence Avial is the first to be served on a Sadhya.[5][6][7]",

    "Atlantic Salmon": " The Atlantic salmon (Salmo salar) is a species of ray-finned fish in the family Salmonidae. It is the third largest of the Salmonidae, behind Siberian taimen and Pacific Chinook salmon, growing up to a meter in length. Atlantic salmon are found in the northern Atlantic Ocean and in rivers that flow into it. Most populations are anadromous, hatching in streams and rivers but moving out to sea as they grow where they mature, after which the adults seasonally move upstream again to spawn.[2] When the mature fish re-enter rivers to spawn, they change in colour and appearance. Some populations of this fish only migrate to large lakes, and are \"landlocked\", spending their entire lives in freshwater. Such populations are found throughout the range of the species. Unlike Pacific species of salmon, S. salar is iteroparous, which means it can survive spawning and return to sea to repeat the process again in another year with 5-10% returning to the sea to spawn again. Such individuals can grow to extremely large sizes, although they are rare. The different life stages of the fish are known by many different names in English: alevin, fry, parr and smolt. Atlantic salmon is considered a very healthy food and one of the fish with a more refined taste in many cultures. As such it features in numerous popular traditional cuisines and can fetch a higher price than some other fish. It has thus long been the target of recreational and commercial fishing, and this, as well as habitat destruction, has impacted the population in some areas. As a result, the species is the subject of conservation efforts in several countries, which appear to have been somewhat successful since the 2000s. Techniques to farm this species using aquacultural methods have also been developed, and at present it is farmed in great numbers in many places around the world.[where?] Although this is now a viable alternative to wild-caught fish, farming methods have attracted criticism from environmentalists.[3] The Atlantic salmon was given its scientific binomial name by Swedish zoologist and taxonomist Carl Linnaeus in 1758. The name, Salmo salar, derives from the Latin salmo, meaning salmon, and salar, meaning leaper, according to M. Barton,[4] but more likely meaning \"resident of salt water\" [citation needed].  Lewis and Short's Latin Dictionary (Clarendon Press, Oxford, 1879) translates salar as a kind of trout from its use in the Idylls of the poet Ausonius (4th century CE). Later, the differently coloured smolts were found to be the same species.[citation needed] Other names used for the Atlantic salmon are: bay salmon, black salmon, caplin-scull salmon, fiddler, sebago salmon, silver salmon, outside salmon and winnish. At different points in their maturation and life cycle, they are known as parr, smolt, grilse, grilt, kelt, slink, and spring salmon. Atlantic salmon that do not journey to sea are known as landlocked salmon (or ouananiche\u00a0[fr] in North America).[5][citation needed] Atlantic salmon are the largest species in their genus, Salmo. After two years at sea, the fish average 71 to 76\u00a0cm (28 to 30\u00a0in) in length and 3.6 to 5.4\u00a0kg (7.9 to 11.9\u00a0lb) in weight.[6] But specimens that spend four or more winters feeding at sea can be much larger. An Atlantic salmon netted in 1960 in Scotland, in the estuary of the river Hope, weighed 49.44\u00a0kg (109.0\u00a0lb), the heaviest recorded in all available literature. Another netted in 1925 in Norway measured 160.65\u00a0cm (63.25\u00a0in) in length, the longest Atlantic salmon on record.[7] The colouration of young Atlantic salmon does not resemble the adult stage. While they live in fresh water, they have blue and red spots. At maturity, they take on a silver-blue sheen. The easiest way of identifying them as an adult is by the black spots predominantly above the lateral line, though the caudal fin is usually unspotted. When they reproduce, males take on a slight green or red colouration. The salmon has a fusiform body, and well-developed teeth. All fins, except the adipose fin, are bordered with black.[citation needed] The natural breeding grounds of Atlantic salmon are rivers in Europe and the northeastern coast of North America. In Europe, Atlantic salmon are still found as far south as Spain, and as far north as Russia.[citation needed] Because of sport-fishing, some of the species' southern populations in northern Spain are growing smaller.[9] The species distribution is easily influenced by changes in freshwater habitat and climate. Atlantic salmon are a cold-water fish species and are particularly sensitive to changes in water temperature.[citation needed] The Housatonic River, and its Naugatuck River tributary, hosted the southernmost Atlantic salmon spawning runs in the United States.[10][11] However, there is a 1609 account by Henry Hudson that Atlantic salmon once ran up the Hudson River.[12] In addition, fish scale evidence dating to 10,000 years BP places Atlantic salmon in a coastal New Jersey pond.[13] Two publications from 1988 and 1996 questioned the notion that Atlantic salmon were prehistorically plentiful in New England, when the climate was warmer as it is now. This argument was primarily based on a paucity of bone data in archaeological sites relative to other fish species, and the assertion that historical claims of abundance may have been exaggerated.[14][15] This argument was later challenged in another paper which claimed that lack of archaeological bone fragments could be explained by salmon bones being rare at sites that still have large salmon runs and that salmonid bones in general are poorly recovered relative to other fish species.[16][17] Atlantic salmon populations were significantly reduced in the United States following European settlement. The fur trade, timber harvesting, dams and mills and agriculture degraded freshwater habitats and lowered the carrying capacity of most North American streams. Beaver populations were trapped to near-extinction by 1800, and log drives and clear-cutting further exacerbated stream erosion and habitat loss. As timber and fur gave way to agriculture, freshwater Atlantic salmon habitat was further compromised. According to historian D.W. Dunfield (1985) \"over half of the historical Atlantic salmon runs had been lost in North America by 1850\". As early as 1798, a bill for the preservation of Atlantic Salmon was introduced in Canadian Parliament, to protect populations in Lake Ontario.[18] In the Gulf Region of Nova Scotia it was reported that 31 of the 33 Atlantic salmon streams were blocked off by lumber dams, leading to the extirpation of early-run fish in many watersheds. The inshore Atlantic salmon fishery became a major export of the New World, with major fishing operations establishing along the shores of major river systems. The southernmost populations were the first to disappear.[citation needed] Young salmon spend one to four years in their natal river. When they are large enough (c. 15 centimetres (5.9\u00a0in)), they smoltify, changing camouflage from stream-adapted with large, gray spots to sea-adapted with shiny sides. They also undergo some endocrinological changes to adapt to osmotic differences between fresh water and seawater habitat. When smoltification is complete, the parr (young fish) now begin to swim with the current instead of against it. With this behavioral change, the fish are now referred to as smolt. When the smolt reach the sea, they follow sea surface currents and feed on plankton or fry from other fish species such as herring. During their time at sea, they can sense the change in the Earth magnetic field through iron in their lateral line.[citation needed] When they have had a year of good growth, they will move to the sea surface currents that transport them back to their natal river. It is a major misconception that salmon swim thousands of kilometres at sea; instead they surf through sea surface currents.[citation needed] It is possible they find their natal river by smell, although this is not confirmed;[19] only 5% of Atlantic salmon go up the wrong river.[citation needed] The range of an individual Atlantic salmon can thus be the river where they are born and the sea surface currents that are connected to that river in a circular path.[citation needed] Wild salmon continued to disappear from many rivers during the twentieth century due to overfishing and habitat change.[19] Young salmon begin a feeding response within a few days. After the yolk sac is absorbed by the body, they begin to hunt. Juveniles start with tiny invertebrates, but as they mature, they may occasionally eat small fish. During this time, they hunt both in the substrate and in the current. Some have been known to eat salmon eggs. Plankton such as euphausiids are important food for pre-grilse but amphipods and decapods are also consumed.[20] The most commonly eaten foods include caddisflies, blackflies, mayflies, stoneflies,[19] and chironomids, as well as terrestrial insects.[20] As adults, the salmon prefer capelin as their meal of choice. Capelin are elongated silvery fish that grow up to 20\u201325 centimetres (8\u201310\u00a0in) long.[21] Other fish consumed include herring, alewives, smelts, scomberids, sand lance, and small cod.[20] Fry and parr have been said[by whom?] to be territorial, but evidence[example  needed] showing them to guard territories is inconclusive. While they may occasionally[when?] be aggressive towards each other, the social hierarchy is still unclear. Many[quantify] have been found[by whom?] to school, especially when leaving the estuary. Adult Atlantic salmon are considered[by whom?] much more aggressive than other salmon, and are more likely to attack other fish than others.[19] Most Atlantic salmon follow an anadromous migration pattern,[2] in that they undergo their greatest feeding and growth in saltwater; however, adults return to spawn in native freshwater streams where the eggs hatch and juveniles grow through several distinct stages.[citation needed] Atlantic salmon do not require saltwater. Numerous examples of fully freshwater (i.e., \"landlocked\") populations of the species exist throughout the Northern Hemisphere,[2] including a now extinct population in Lake Ontario, which has been shown in recent studies to have spent its entire life cycle in the watershed of the lake.[22] In North America, the landlocked strains are frequently known as ouananiche.[citation needed] The freshwater phases of Atlantic salmon vary between two and eight years, according to river location.[23] While the young in southern rivers, such as those to the English Channel, are only one year old when they leave, those further north, such as in Scottish rivers, can be over four years old, and in Ungava Bay, northern Quebec, smolts as old as eight years have been encountered.[23] The first phase is the alevin stage, when the fish stay in the breeding ground and use the remaining nutrients in their yolk sacs. During this developmental stage, their young gills develop and they become active hunters. Next is the fry stage, where the fish grow and subsequently leave the breeding ground in search of food. During this time, they move to areas with higher prey concentration. The final freshwater stage is when they develop into parr, in which they prepare for the trek to the Atlantic Ocean.[citation needed] During these times, the Atlantic salmon are very susceptible to predation. Nearly 40% are eaten by trout alone. Other predators include other fish and birds.[citation needed] Egg and juvenile survival is dependent on habitat quality as Atlantic salmon are sensitive to ecological change.[citation needed] When parr develop into smolt, they begin the trip to the ocean, which predominantly happens between March and June. Migration allows acclimation to the changing salinity. Once ready, young smolt leave, preferring an ebb tide.[citation needed] Having left their natal streams, they experience a period of rapid growth during the one to four years they live in the ocean. Typically, Atlantic salmon migrate from their home streams to an area on the continental plate off West Greenland. During this time, they face predation from humans, seals, Greenland sharks, skate, cod, and halibut. Some dolphins have been noticed playing with dead salmon, but it is still unclear whether they consume them.[citation needed] Once large enough, Atlantic salmon change into the grilse phase, when they become ready to return to the same freshwater tributary they departed from as smolts. After returning to their natal streams, the salmon will cease eating altogether prior to spawning. Although largely unknown, odor \u2013 the exact chemical signature of that stream \u2013 may play an important role in how salmon return to the area where they hatched. Once heavier than about 250\u00a0g, the fish no longer become prey for birds and many fish, although seals do prey upon them. Grey and common seals commonly eat Atlantic salmon. Survivability to this stage has been estimated at between 14 and 53%.[19] Atlantic salmon breed in the rivers of Western Europe from northern Portugal north to Norway, Iceland, and Greenland, and the east coast of North America from Connecticut in the United States north to northern Labrador and Arctic Canada.[citation needed] The species constructs a nest or \"redd\" in the gravel bed of a stream. The female creates a powerful downdraught of water with her tail near the gravel to excavate a depression. After she and a male fish have eggs and milt (sperm), respectively, upstream of the depression, the female again uses her tail, this time to shift gravel to cover the eggs and milt which have lodged in the depression.[citation needed] Unlike the various Pacific salmon species which die after spawning (semelparous), the Atlantic salmon is iteroparous, which means the fish may recondition themselves and return to the sea to repeat the migration and spawning pattern several times, although most spawn only once or twice.[2][24] Migration and spawning exact an enormous physiological toll on individuals, such that repeat spawners are the exception rather than the norm.[24] Atlantic salmon show high diversity in age of maturity and may mature as parr, one- to five-sea-winter fish, and in rare instances, at older sea ages. This variety of ages can occur in the same population, constituting a 'bet hedging' strategy against variation in stream flows. So in a drought year, some fish of a given age will not return to spawn, allowing that generation other, wetter years in which to spawn.[23] When in shared breeding habitats, Atlantic salmon will hybridize with brown trout (Salmo trutta).[25][26][27] Hybrids between Atlantic salmon and brown trout were detected in two of four watersheds studied in northern Spain. The proportions of hybrids in samples of salmon ranged from 0 to 7-7% but these proportions were not significantly homogeneous among locations, resulting in a mean hybridization rate of 2-3%. This is the highest rate of natural hybridization so far reported and is significantly greater than rates observed elsewhere in Europe.[28] The decline in anadromous salmonid species over the last two to three centuries is correlated with the decline in the North American beaver and European beaver, although some fish and game departments[example  needed] continue to advocate removal of beaver dams as potential barriers to spawning runs. Migration of adult Atlantic salmon may be limited by beaver dams during periods of low stream flows, but the presence of juvenile salmon upstream of the dams suggests they are penetrated by parr.[29] Downstream migration of Atlantic salmon smolts was similarly unaffected by beaver dams, even in periods of low flows.[29] In a 2003 study, Atlantic salmon and sea-run brown trout spawning in the Numedalsl\u00e5gen River and 51 of its tributaries in southeastern Norway was unhindered by beavers.[30] In a restored, third-order stream in northern Nova Scotia, beaver dams generally posed no barrier to Atlantic salmon migration except in the smallest upstream reaches in years of low flow where pools were not deep enough to enable the fish to leap the dam or without a column of water over-topping the dam for the fish to swim up.[31] The importance of winter habitat to salmonids afforded by beaver ponds may be especially important in streams of northerly latitudes without deep pools where ice cover makes contact with the bottom of shallow streams.[29] In addition, the up to eight-year-long residence time of juveniles in freshwater may make beaver-created permanent summer pools a crucial success factor for Atlantic salmon populations. In fact, two-year-old Atlantic salmon parr in beaver ponds in eastern Canada showed faster summer growth in length and mass and were in better condition than parr upstream or downstream from the pond.[32] Atlantic salmon is a popular fish for human consumption[2] and is commonly sold fresh, canned, or frozen.[citation needed] Wood and stone weirs along streams and ponds were used for millennia to harvest salmon in the rivers of New England.[33] European fishermen gillnetted for Atlantic salmon in rivers using hand-made nets for many centuries[34] and gillnetting was also used in early colonial America.[35] In its natal streams, Atlantic salmon are considered prized recreational fish, pursued by fly anglers during its annual runs. At one time, the species supported an important commercial fishery, but having become endangered throughout its range globally, wild-caught Atlantic salmon are now virtually absent from the market.[36] Instead, nearly all are from aquaculture farms, predominantly in Norway, Chile, Canada, the UK, Ireland, Faroe Islands, Russia and Tasmania in Australia.[24] Adult male and female fish are anaesthetised; their eggs and sperm are \"stripped\" after the fish are cleaned and cloth dried. Sperm and eggs are mixed, washed, and placed into freshwater. Adults recover in flowing, clean, well-aerated water.[37] Some researchers have even studied cryopreservation of their eggs.[38] Fry are generally reared in large freshwater tanks for 12 to 20 months. Once the fish have reached the smolt phase, they are taken out to sea, where they are held for up to two years. During this time, the fish grow and mature in large cages off the coasts of Canada, the US, or parts of Europe.[24] There are many different commercially available cage designs built to operate in a wide variety of aquatic conditions. High-density polyethylene (HDPE) cages are widely used, with HDPE pipes forming a floating collar ring onto which the fish net pen is secured and suspended in the water below.[39] Advancements in cage technologies have allowed for reduction in fish escapes, improvement in growing conditions, and maximization of aquaculture production volume per unit area of growing space.[39] Farmed Atlantic salmon are known to occasionally escape from cages and enter the habitat of wild populations. Interbreeding between escaped farm fish and wild fish decreases genetic diversity and introduces \"the potential to genetically alter native populations, reduce local adaptation and negatively affect population viability and character\".[40] A study in 2000 demonstrated that the genes of farmed Atlantic salmon intrude wild populations mainly through wild males breeding with farmed females, though farmed specimens showed reduced capacity for breeding success overall compared to their wild counterparts.[41] Further study in 2018 discovered extensive cross-breeding of wild and farmed Atlantic salmon in the Northwest Atlantic, showing that 27.1% of fish in 17 out of 18 rivers examined are artificially stocked or hybrids. Farming of Atlantic salmon in open cages at sea has also been linked, at least in part, to a decline in wild stocks attributed to the passing of parasites from farmed to wild individuals.[42] On the west coast of the United States and Canada, aquaculturists are generally under scrutiny to ensure that non-native Atlantic salmon cannot escape from their open-net pens, however occasional incidents of escape have been documented.[43] During one incident in 2017, for example, up to 300,000 potentially invasive Atlantic salmon escaped a farm among the San Juan Islands in Puget Sound, Washington.[44] Washington went on in 2019 to implement a gradual phase out of salmon farming to be completed by 2025.[45] Despite being the source of considerable controversy,[46] the likelihood of escaped Atlantic salmon establishing an invasive presence in the Pacific Northwest is considered minimal, largely because a number of 20th century efforts aimed at deliberately introducing them to the region were ultimately unsuccessful.[47] From 1905 until 1935, for example, in excess of 8.6 million Atlantic salmon of various life stages (predominantly advanced fry) were intentionally introduced to more than 60 individual British Columbia lakes and streams. Historical records indicate, in a few instances, mature sea-run Atlantic salmon were captured in the Cowichan River; however, a self-sustaining population never materialized. Similarly unsuccessful results were realized after deliberate attempts at introduction by Washington as late as the 1980s.[48] Consequently, environmental assessments by the US National Marine Fisheries Service (NMFS), the Washington Department of Fish and Wildlife and the BC Environmental Assessment Office have concluded the potential risk of Atlantic salmon colonization in the Pacific Northwest is low.[49] A study of N\u00e6ve et al. (2022) estimated the impact of 50 years of genetic selection and tried to predict the impact it could have until 2050. In order to do this, a common garden experiment was used to model and simulate past and future effects for 11 generations of genetic selection of increased growth rate in Atlantic salmon. To model the contribution that breeding has made in the industry from generation 0 (harvested in 1975\u2013 1978) to generation 11 (harvested in 2017 \u2013 2019), and to simulate growth until 2050 (generation 24), the Norwegian salmon aquaculture production between 2016 and 2019 was used as a base case. The simulation of the expected growth until 2050 (generation 24) gave five different scenarios\u00a0: Historical (H1), Forecast 1 (F1), Forecast 2 (F2), Forecast 3 (F3) and Forecast 4 (F4). Changes in thermal growth coefficient (TGC) per generation were used in the model to simulate the differences in the five scenarios. The genetic data, H1, and the most conservative forecast scenario, F1, simulate what can be expected in 2050 if the trend from generation 0 through 11 is maintained. The following forecast scenarios assume a greater increase in genetic growth with a larger increase in the TGC in the generations to come. In the next two generations, more advanced selection methods such as marker assisted selection (from generation 10) and genomic selection (from generation 11) were implemented. This resulted in increased gain in selection for growth and simulated F2 and F3. The most progressive scenario, F4, aimed at exploring the effect in the industry when the full genetic potential is utilized. This assumes a further development of advanced techniques in the years to come.\nThe authors of the article found that the daily yield of the biomass increased with increasing generations in the historic and forecast scenarios. Further, the production time in seawater to reach the harvest weight of 5100 g is expected to be reduced by 53% in 2050. When production time can be reduced, this will also reduce e.g. time at risk of diseases. In the most progressive scenario, mortality in seawater was expected to be reduced by up to 50%. Further, the authors found that production per license can increase by up to 121%. Additionally, 77% of the new volume needed to achieve five million tonnes in 2050, may be provided by genomic selection. However, one should keep in mind that this article was published by the firm Aquagen, and can possibly be biased and too optimistic.[50] The IUCN rates this as a common species with a conservation status of \"least concern\", however it has been 25 years since the IUCN has released this status.[51][52] A more recent regional assessment revealed that the European population of this species is vulnerable, and this might be the same or a similar status globally. Location-specific assessments have shown population declines across parts of the Atlantic Salmon's natural range, with populations along the coast of Maine and the Inner Bay of Fundy now listed as \"endangered\" under the Endangered Species Act, and the Canadian Species at Risk Act, respectively.[53][51] Human activities have impacted salmon populations across parts of its range. The major threats are from overfishing and habitat change.[18] Salmon decline in Lake Ontario goes back to the 18th\u201319th centuries, due to logging and soil erosion, as well as dam and mill construction. By 1896, the species was declared extirpated from the lake.[22][54] In the 1950s, salmon from rivers in the United States and Canada, as well as from Europe, were discovered to gather in the sea around Greenland and the Faroe Islands. A commercial fishing industry was established, taking salmon using drift nets. After an initial series of record annual catches, the numbers crashed; between 1979 and 1990, catches fell from four million to 700,000.[55] Beginning around 1990, the rates of Atlantic salmon mortality at sea more than doubled in the western Atlantic. Rivers of the coast of Maine, southern New Brunswick and much of mainland Nova Scotia saw runs drop precipitously, and even disappear. An international effort to study the increased mortality rate was organized by the North Atlantic Salmon Conservation Organization.[5] In 2000 the numbers of Atlantic salmon dropped to very low levels in Newfoundland, Canada.[56] In 2007 at least one sport fishing organization from Iceland and Scandinavia blamed less fish caught by recreational anglers on overfishing at sea, and thus created the North Atlantic Salmon Fund to buy commercial quotas in the Atlantic from commercial fishermen in an effort to preserve wild Salmo salar stocks.[55] Possibly because of improvements in ocean feeding grounds, returns in 2008 were very positive. On the Penobscot River in Maine, returns were about 940 in 2007, and by mid-July 2008, the return was 1,938. Similar stories were reported in rivers from Newfoundland to Quebec. In 2011, more than 3,100 salmon returned to the Penobscot, the most since 1986, and nearly 200 ascended the Narraguagus River, up from the low two digits just a decade before.[5][57] Recreational fishing of stocked, landlocked Atlantic salmon is now authorized in much of the US and Canada where it occurs in large numbers, but this is subject to regulations in many states or provinces which are designed to maintain the continuity of the species. Strict catch limits, catch and release practices and forced fly fishing are examples of those regulations.[58][59] However, catch and release angling can be an additional stressor on Atlantic salmon populations, especially when its impacts are combined with the existing pressures of climate change, overfishing, and predation.[60][58] Around the North Atlantic, efforts to restore salmon to their native habitats are underway, with slow progress. Habitat restoration and protection are key to this process, but issues of excessive harvest and competition with farmed and escaped salmon are also primary considerations. In the Great Lakes, Atlantic salmon have been reintroduced, but the percentage of salmon reproducing naturally is very low. Most areas are re-stocked annually.[18] Since the extirpation of Atlantic salmon from Lake Ontario in the late 19th century, the state of New York has stocked its adjoining rivers and tributaries, and in many cases does not allow active fishing.[2][61][18] The province of Ontario started the Atlantic Salmon Restoration Program[62] in 2006, which is one of the largest freshwater conservation programs in North America. It has since stocked Lake Ontario and surrounding tributaries with upwards of 6,000,000 young Atlantic salmon, with efforts growing each year.[63] In New England, many efforts are underway to restore salmon to the region by knocking down obsolete dams and updating others with fish ladders and other techniques that have proven effective in the West with Pacific salmon. There is some success thus far, with populations growing in the Penobscot and Connecticut Rivers. Lake Champlain now has Atlantic salmon. The Atlantic Salmon Federation is involved in restoration efforts along the eastern United States and Canada, where their projects are focused on removing barriers to fish passage and eradicating invasive species.[64] Recent documented successes in the reintroduction of Atlantic salmon include the following: The North Atlantic Salmon Conservation Organization is an international council made up of Canada, the European Union, Iceland, Norway, the Russian Federation, and the United States, with its headquarters in Edinburgh. It was established in 1983 to help protect Atlantic salmon stocks, through the cooperation between nations. They work to restore habitat and promote conservation of the salmon.[68] In December 2021, NASCO published an updated interactive map of their Rivers Database, showing the stock status of wild Atlantic salmon populations across the species range. Edward I instituted a penalty for collecting salmon during certain times of the year. His son Edward II continued, regulating the construction of weirs. Enforcement was overseen by those appointed by the justices of the peace. Because of confusing laws and the appointed conservators having little power, most laws were barely enforced.[citation needed] Based on this, a royal commission was appointed in 1860 to thoroughly investigate the Atlantic salmon and the laws governing the species, resulting in the 1861 Salmon Fisheries Act. The act placed enforcement of the laws under the Home Office's control, but it was later transferred to the Board of Trade, and then later to the Board of Agriculture and Fisheries. Another act passed in 1865 imposed charges to fish and catch limits. It also caused the formation of local boards having jurisdiction over a certain river. The next significant act, passed in 1907, allowed the board to charge 'duties' to catch other freshwater fish, including trout.[citation needed] Despite legislation, board effects decreased until, in 1948, the River Boards Act gave authority of all freshwater fish and the prevention of pollution to one board per river. In total, it created 32 boards. In 1974, the 32 boards, which by then were integrated into regional river authorities, were reduced to 10 regional water authorities (RWAs). Although only the Northumbrian Water Authority, Welsh National Water Development Authority, Northwest Water Authority and Southwest Water Authority  had significant salmon populations, all ten also regulated and conserved  trout and freshwater eel fisheries The Salmon and Freshwater Fisheries Act was passed in 1975. Among other things, it regulated fishing licences, seasons, and size limits, and banned obstructing the salmon's migratory paths.[19] Salmon was greatly valued in medieval Scotland, and various fishing methods, including the use of weirs, cruives, and nets, were used to catch the fish. Fishing for salmon was heavily regulated in order to conserve the resource.[69] In 1318, King Robert I enacted legislation setting a minimum size for cruives, \"so that no fry of fish are impeded from ascending and descending...\" Laws on catching fish upon royal lands were frequently updated, demonstrating their importance.[69] Because the fish were held in such high regard, poachers were severely punished; a person twice convicted of poaching salmon on a royal estate could be sentenced to death.[70] The export of salmon was economically important in Aberdeen; beginning in the 15th century, the fish could be preserved through salting and barreling, allowing them to be exported abroad, including as far away as the Baltic. The volume of the early Scottish salmon trade is impossible to determine, since surviving custom records date only from the 1420 onward, and since Aberdeen burgesses enjoyed an exemption on salmon customs until the 1530s.[71] During the 15th century, many laws were passed; many regulated fishing times, and worked to ensure smolts could safely pass downstream. James III even closed a meal mill because of its history of killing fish attracted to the wheel.[citation needed] More recent legislation has established commissioners who manage districts. Furthermore, the Salmon and Freshwater Fisheries Act in 1951 required the Secretary of State be given data about the catches of salmon and trout to help establish catch limits.[19][37] Commercial and recreational fishing of wild, anadromous Atlantic salmon is prohibited in the United States.[6] Several populations of Atlantic salmon are in serious decline, and are listed as endangered under the Endangered Species Act (ESA). Currently, runs of 11 rivers in Maine are on the list \u2013 Kennebec, Androscoggin, Penobscot, Sheepscot, Ducktrap, Cove Brook, Pleasant, Narraguagus, Machias, East Machias and Dennys. The Penobscot River is the \"anchor river\" for Atlantic salmon populations in the US. Returning fish in 2008 were around 2,000, more than double the 2007 return of 940.[citation needed] Section 9 of the ESA makes it illegal to take an endangered species of fish or wildlife. The definition of \"take\" is to \"harass, harm, pursue, hunt, shoot, wound, kill, trap, capture, or collect, or to attempt to engage in any such conduct\".[72] The federal government has prime responsibility for protecting the Atlantic salmon, but over the last generation, effort has continued to shift management as much as possible to provincial authorities through memoranda of understanding, for example. A new Atlantic salmon policy is in the works, and in the past three years,[when?] the government has attempted to pass a new version of the century-old Fisheries Act through Parliament.[citation needed] Federal legislation regarding at-risk populations is weak.[citation needed] Inner Bay of Fundy Atlantic salmon runs were declared endangered in 2000. A recovery and action plan is in place.[73] Nongovernmental organizations, such as the Atlantic Salmon Federation,[74] constantly demand for improvements in management, and for initiatives to be considered. For example, the ASF and the Nova Scotia Salmon Association desire the use of technology for mitigation of acid rain-affected rivers such as used in Norway is in 54 Nova Scotia rivers and managed to raise the funds to get a project in place in one river.[citation needed] In Quebec, the daily catch limit for Atlantic salmon is dependent on the individual river. Some rivers are strictly catch and release with a limit of 3 released fish. Each catch must be declared. Some rivers allow you to keep between 1 or 2 grilse (30\u00a0cm to 63\u00a0cm), while some of the more prolific rivers (mainly on the north coast) will allow you to keep 1 salmon over 63\u00a0cm. The annual catch limit is 4 Atlantic salmon of small size and only 1 of those may be bigger than 63\u00a0cm.[citation needed] In Lake Ontario, the historic populations of Atlantic salmon became extinct, and cross-national efforts have been under way to reintroduce the species, with some areas already having restocked naturally reproducing populations.[75][76]",
    "Aviyal": " Avial (Malayalam: \u0d05\u0d35\u0d3f\u0d2f\u0d32\u0d4d\u200d, pronounced [a\u028bijal]) is an Indian dish with origins in the state of Kerala of India. [1] It is a thick stew of usually 13 vegetables commonly found in the Western Ghats and coconut, seasoned with coconut oil and curry leaves. Avial is considered an essential part of the main meal in Kerala (oonu in Malayalam) and is also served as a delicacy in South India.[2] Central Travancore has a slightly different variety of avial with its thin gravy whereas the classic avial is thick. Generally, only crisp vegetables are used in avial. Vegetables commonly used in avial are elephant foot yam, plantain, ash melon (wax gourd), carrots, beans, brinjal (aubergine), cucumber, drumstick pods, snake gourd and broad bean, etc. are the recent introduction, while the Avial from the Kozhikode region includes bitter gourd. Variants of avial from the Kollam region also includes tomato among other vegetables. Some people prefer to skip curd or replace it with raw mango or tamarind pulp. This dish can be made into a gravy or be made into a semi-dry side dish. It is generally eaten with rice. The word \"avial\" is also used to denote 'boiled' or 'cooked in water' \u2014 this sense being derived from the way the dish is made. Avial is believed to have been invented by the warrior Bhima during his exile. According to the legend, when Ballava\n(Bhima's name during this time) assumed his duties as the cook in the kitchen of Virata, he did not know how to cook. One of the first things he did was to chop up many different vegetables, boil them together and top the dish with grated coconut. [3][4]\nThere are mythological variations. Bhima is said to have prepared Avial, when there were unexpected guests for King Virata and he needed to serve meals for them. There were no sufficient vegetables to cook any single recipe for a side dish, so Bheema used whatever available vegetables to make a new dish, which came to be known as Avial. Another narrative version relates to the attempt made by Kauravas to kill Bhima. After poisoning Bhima, Kauravas tied Bhima and threw him into the water. Kauravas also communicated that they saw Bhima drowning in water. With the completion of the days of mourning, a funeral feast was planned and preparation were underway. Unexpectedly, Bhima emerged from the water, rescued by the Nagas. With this, preparations for the feast was cancelled. However, Bhima was unhappy with this decision, and decided to mix all of the vegetables to prepare a new dish which later became popular as Avial. Another popular old story is that in the Kingdom of Travancore in Kerala there was a great feast held by the king. Every one in the kingdom came to eat so there was a shortage of curry to be served. But in the kitchen also stocks were less so when the king visited the kitchen he found that a lot of vegetables were wasted when they were peeled. The king ordered the cook to make a curry with this along with some other ingredients so Avial was born. The king also ordered it to be served as the first item. Hence Avial is the first to be served on a Sadhya.[5][6][7]",
    "Baingan Bharta": " Baigan bharta, also spelled baingan bharta or baigan chokha[1] (mashed eggplant)[a] is an Indian dish prepared by mashing or mincing grilled eggplant (baigan) with tomato, onion, herbs and spices, with variations being common from chef to chef.[b] Traditionally, cooking the eggplants over charcoals, inside of a tandoor, barbecue grill or oven, or even directly applying flame to the outside of the fruit infuses the dish with a smoky flavour; the blackened skin is then easily peeled and the eggplant may be further prepared. Baigan bharta is most often grilled, minced eggplant stewed with chopped tomato, browned onion or shallots, ginger, garlic, cumin, and topped with lime or lemon juice, fresh cilantro (coriander leaves) and sliced fresh green chili pepper. Depending on region and personal tastes, ghee (clarified butter) may be used in preparation of the dish. In some regions where mustard oil is popular, this may be used, though it possesses a powerful flavour and aroma. Most chefs use a neutral, high-smoking-point vegetable oil like canola or sunflower oil.[3] Traditionally, the dish is eaten by hand with flatbread (specifically roti, naan or paratha), and can also be served with a variety of rice dishes, like biryani, khichdi or pulao. The meal will usually be rounded-out with various pickles (mango, lime, lemon, etc) as well as raita, a palate-cooling yogurt dish/condiment (similar to Greek tzatziki) with many forms, including mint, mango or cucumber preparations. In Bihar and Uttar Pradesh, it is served hot with litti or baati.[4] In India, Pakistan and Bangladesh, baigan bharta is part of the most popular cuisine items. In India, it is found in various regional styles, with ingredients varying from one region to another. Some chefs and recipes utilise seasonal mashed pumpkin, squash or sweet potato for added thickness and flavour. The dish has since spread to areas outside of India, particularly countries with high numbers of Indians and their descendants, including the United Kingdom, Australia, and parts of the United States and Canada. It is popularly eaten in the Caribbean, in places like Guyana, Jamaica and Trinidad & Tobago, where it is known as baigan chokha.[5] The dish has several regional names, such as: baigan ka bharta (Hindi: \u092c\u0948\u0917\u0928 \u0915\u093e \u092d\u0930\u0924\u093e, Urdu: \u0628\u06cc\u0646\u06af\u0646 \u06a9\u0627 \u0628\u06be\u0631\u062a\u06c1), baingan da bharrtha (Punjabi: \u0a2c\u0a48\u0a02\u0a17\u0a23 \u0a26\u0a3e \u0a2d\u0a71\u0a5c\u0a25\u0a3e), ringan no oro (Gujarati: \u0ab0\u0ac0\u0a82\u0a97\u0aa3\u0aa8\u0acb \u0a93\u0ab3\u0acb), pura begena satoni (Assamese: \u09aa\u09c1\u09f0\u09be \u09ac\u09c7\u0999\u09c7\u09a8\u09be \u099a\u09be\u099f\u09a8\u09bf) or bengena pitika (Assamese: \u09ac\u09c7\u0999\u09c7\u09a8\u09be \u09aa\u09bf\u099f\u09bf\u0995\u09be), wangyacha bharit (Marathi: \u0935\u093e\u0902\u0917\u094d\u092f\u093e\u091a\u0902 \u092d\u0930\u0940\u0924), ennegayi (Kannada: \u0c8e\u0ca3\u0ccd\u0ca3\u0cc6\u0c97\u0cbe\u0caf\u0cbf), baigana bhartta (Odia: \u0b2c\u0b3e\u0b07\u0b17\u0b23 \u0b2d\u0b30\u0b4d\u0b24\u0b4d\u0b24\u0b3e), begun bh\u00f4rta (Bengali: \u09ac\u09c7\u0997\u09c1\u09a8 \u09ad\u09b0\u09cd\u09a4\u09be), baingoin satni (Sylheti: \ua81b\ua823\ua801\ua80b\ua809\ua802\ua818 \ua80c\ua823\ua810\ua818\ua824) , olo (Gujarati) and wangan tsetin (Kashmiri: \u0648\u0627\u0646\u065b\u06af\u0646 \u0698\u0620\u0679\u0650\u0646). The beauty of Baigan Bharta lies in its versatility. While the core ingredients remain the same, regional variations and personal preferences lead to diverse flavor profiles. Some common variations include: Classic Baigan Bharta: This classic rendition features a vibrant spice blend of garlic, coriander, red chili powder, and cumin. Dahi Baigan Bharta: This version incorporates dahi for a creamier texture and tangy twist, often balanced with fresh cilantro and Mint leaves. Spicy Baigan Bharta: For those who love heat, additional chilies or spices like garam masala and fenugreek seeds can be added. In Gujarat, it is called ringan no oro (Gujarati: \u0ab0\u0ac0\u0a82\u0a97\u0aa3\u0aa8\u0acb \u0a93\u0ab3\u0acb), in which the eggplant is roasted, then mashed, and then saut\u00e9ed with mustard and cumin seeds, turmeric, red chilli powder, ginger and garlic and salt. It is served with bajra no rotlo (Gujarati: \u0aac\u0abe\u0a9c\u0ab0\u0abe\u0a82\u0aa8\u0acb \u0ab0\u0acb\u0a9f\u0ab2\u0acb), kadhi (a soup prepared by gram flour, curd and spices), khichadi and chhaash (Gujarati: \u0a9b\u0abe\u0ab6) (buttermilk). In Karnataka, it is called e\u1e47\u1e47eg\u0101yi and is prepared by boiling and frying a whole eggplant, and is usually served with akki rotti. In the South Indian state of Tamil Nadu, the Tamils prepare a similar dish called kathrikai thayir kothsu, in which the eggplant is cooked, mashed, and saut\u00e9ed with mustard, red chilis and sesame oil. The final step in the recipe involves adding yogurt (curds) to the mixture and dressing the dish with coriander leaves. In the Bhojpuri-speaking regions of India (such as eastern Uttar Pradesh and western Bihar), it is known as baigan ka chokha;[6] it is also popular within the Indo-Caribbean communities of Trinidad and Tobago, Suriname, and Guyana, where many descendants of indentured labourers from northern India live. In Maharashtra, especially in the northern Khandesh region, vangyache bharit as they call it is served in social gatherings including wedding ceremonies. During harvest season, a special \"bharit party\" is organised. Bharit is usually served with puri. In the Vidarbha and Khandesh regions of Maharashtra, two variants are popular: kachha (\"raw\") bharit and phodni cha (with tadka) bharit. In kachha bharit, all the ingredients except for eggplant are used uncooked. Raw spring onion, tomato, green chillies, green coriander, and sometimes fresh fenugreek leaves are mixed with flame-roasted eggplant along with raw linseed oil or peanut oil. In phodni cha bharit, the above ingredients are first fried in oil with spices; then, mashed eggplants are mixed into it and cooked together. A similar process is followed in other Indian states and Pakistan with slight variations in ingredients. In Vidarbha and Khandesh, it is considered a delicacy when the eggplants are roasted on dried cotton plant stems, a process which gives a distinct smokey flavour to the dish. The dish is served with dal, bhakri, and rice. In a protest against Bt brinjal and the introduction of genetically modified crops, volunteers from Greenpeace and Delhi's Le M\u00e9ridien hotel cooked 342 kilograms (754\u00a0lb) of organic brinjal bharta at Dilli Haat, New Delhi, on 6 September 2011. This set a world record for the largest amount of the dish produced in one occasion of preparation. A portion of the final dish was sent to Indian Prime Minister Manmohan Singh's residence, accompanied by a letter of protest containing an explanation.[7][8] 30\u201360\u00a0\u00b0C (86\u2013140\u00a0\u00b0F)",
    "Basmati Rice": "Basmati (pronounced ['b\u0251\u02d0sm\u0259t\u032ai\u02d0]) is a variety of long, slender-grained aromatic rice which is traditionally grown in the Indian subcontinent, mainly India, and Pakistan, as well as some regions of Sri Lanka and Nepal.[2] As of 2019[update], India accounted for 65% of the international trade in basmati rice, while Pakistan accounted for the remaining 35%.[3][4] Many countries use domestically grown basmati rice crops;[5] however, basmati is geographically exclusive to certain districts of India and Pakistan.[6] According to the Indian Agricultural and Processed Food Products Export Development Authority (APEDA), a rice variety is eligible to be called basmati if it has a minimum average precooked milled rice length of 6.61\u00a0mm (0.260\u00a0in) and average precooked milled rice breadth of up to 2\u00a0mm (0.079\u00a0in), among other parameters.[7] According to Oxford English Dictionary, the word basmati derives from Hindi b\u0101smat\u012b, literally, 'fragrant'.[8] Basmati rice is believed to have been cultivated in the Indian subcontinent for centuries. The earliest mention of basmati rice was made in the epic Heer Ranjha composed by the Punjabi poet Waris Shah in 1766.[9][10] India accounts for over 70% of the world's basmati rice production.[11] A small portion of that is being grown organically. Organisations such as Kheti Virasat Mission are trying to increase the amount of organic basmati rice that is being grown in the Punjab in India.[12][13] The areas which have a geographical indication for basmati rice production in India are in the states of Uttarakhand, Bihar,[14] Punjab, Haryana, Himachal Pradesh, Delhi, Western Uttar Pradesh, Odisha and Jammu and Kashmir.[15][unreliable source?] India's total basmati production for the July 2011 \u2013 June 2012 crop year was five million tonnes.[16] From April 2018 to March 2019, India exported 4.4 million metric tons of basmati rice.[17] In 2015\u20132016, Saudi Arabia, Iran and UAE were the three biggest destinations for India's basmati rice exports and exports to these three countries accounted for more than half of India's total basmati exports.[18] In 2015\u20132016, basmati rice worth US$3.4 billion was exported from India.[18] From 2018-2021 annual exports have surpassed $4 billion USD[19] According to the Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO), Pakistan's original basmati area lies in the Kalar bowl between the Ravi and Chenab rivers. Almost all the cultivation of basmati takes place in the Punjab province where total production was 2.47\u00a0million metric tons (2,430,000 long tons; 2,720,000 short tons) in 2010.[20][21][22][23] In fiscal year 2020, basmati exports stood at 890,207 tonnes valuing $790 million.[24] In overall basmati exports, Europe holds a 40% share while the rest are exported to Gulf countries, Australia and US.[24] Indonesia produced its own local variant of basmati in West Java and Central Kalimantan, with production capacity estimated to reach up to 8.2 tonnes per hectare.[25] Basmati seeds were first brought from Pakistan in 2007; however, the seeds were unable to be grown due to soil incompatibility. The Ministry of Agriculture then managed to produce and cultivate a hybrid between basmati and local rice in 2017.[26] Basmati rice is produced mainly in the Terai region of Nepal and some parts of Kathmandu valley. Unique Nepali varieties of basmati rice were barred from export to other parts of the world although this ban might be lifted.[27] Small amounts of basmati rice, especially red basmati rice, are being cultivated in the tropical wet zone areas of Sri Lanka.[28][29][30] Basmati rice has a typical pandan-like (Pandanus amaryllifolius leaf) flavour caused by the aroma compound 2-acetyl-1-pyrroline.[31] Basmati grains contain about 0.09 ppm of this aromatic chemical compound naturally, a level that is about 12 times as much as non-basmati rice varieties, giving basmati its distinctive fragrance and flavour.[32] This natural aroma is also found in cheese, fruit and other cereals. It is a flavoring agent approved in the United States and Europe, and is used in bakery products for aroma.[33] During cooking, the level of 2-acetyl-1-pyrroline decreases. Soaking the rice for 30 minutes before cooking permits 20% shorter cooking times and preserves more of the 2-acetyl-1-pyrroline.[34] According to the Canadian Diabetes Association, basmati, brown, wild, short and long grain rice has a medium glycemic index (between 56 and 69), opposed to jasmine and instant white rice with a glycemic index of 89, thus making it more suitable for diabetics as compared to certain other grains and products made from white flour.[35] There are several varieties of basmati rice. Traditional Indian types include basmati 370, basmati 385, and basmati Ranbirsinghpura (R.S.Pura) and Gujjar Chack area in Jammu province situated at the India-Pakistani border in Jammu Kashmir state of India. 1121 and Muradabadi 6465 Extra Long Grain Rice. Pakistani basmati rice varieties are PK 385, Super Kernel Basmati Rice, and D-98. Scientists at Indian Agricultural Research Institute (IARI), Delhi, used conventional plant breeding to produce a hybrid semi-dwarf plant which had most of the good features of traditional basmati (grain elongation, fragrance, alkali content). This hybrid was called Pusa Basmati-1 (PB1; also called \"Todal\", because the flower has awns); crop yield is up to twice as high as traditional varieties. Fragrant rices that are derived from basmati stock but are not true basmati varieties include PB2 (also called sugandh-2), PB3, and RS-10. Dehradun Basmati or traditional basmati rice variety type 3[36] is a group of various Basmati varieties that originated in the present day Dehradun of Uttarakhand, India. From Dehradun the variety was propagated and grown in other regions of Uttarakhand, most notably in Tapovan, Tehri. The Basmati varieties collectively known as Dehradun Basmati are significant because of their higher grain quality, unique 'popcorn' aroma and flavour.[37] The Dehradun Basmati has also been the source of other GMO varieties grown in present day Uttar Pradesh, Punjab and Haryana. Despite not all varieties having received official GI certification Dehradun Basmati varieties consistently rank among the highest rated rice varieties in the world and are distinct for their popcorn like aroma. The popcorn aroma is among some of the special properties Basmati exhibits when grown under the agro-climatic conditions of the Himalayan region.

The rice is produced by Rice Select,[42] previously owned by RiceTec (mentioned below).[43] In Kenya, a rice variety called Pishori or Pisori is grown in the Mwea region.[44] The word Pishori is an alteration of the word Peshawari from where the basmati variety used to be exported to the countries of East Africa in the past.[45] The Basmati Mark is a DNA-fingerprinting-based certification done by the laboratory of Basmati Export Development Foundation (BEDF).[46] On 15 February 2016, the Agricultural & Processed Food Products Export Development Authority (APEDA), an autonomous organisation under the Department of Commerce in India, registered basmati rice as a product with Geographical Indication (GI).[47] Difficulty in differentiating genuine basmati from other types of rice and the significant price difference between them has led fraudulent traders to adulterate basmati rice with crossbred basmati varieties and long-grain non-basmati varieties. In Britain, the Food Standards Agency found in 2005 that about half of all basmati rice sold was adulterated with other strains of long-grain rice, prompting rice importers to agree to a code of practice.[48] A 2010 UK test on rice supplied by wholesalers found 4 out of 15 samples had cheaper rice mixed with basmati, and one had no basmati at all.[49] A PCR-based assay similar to DNA fingerprinting in humans allows adulterated and non-basmati strains to be detected, with a detection limit from 1% adulteration upwards with an error rate of \u00b11.5%.[50] Exporters of basmati rice use purity certificates based on DNA tests for their basmati rice consignments.[51] Based on this protocol, which was developed at the Centre for DNA Fingerprinting and Diagnostics, the Indian company Lab India has released kits to detect basmati adulteration.[52] In September 1997, an American company, RiceTec, was granted U.S. Patent No. 5,663,484 on \"basmati rice lines and grains\". The patent secures lines of basmati and basmati-like rice and ways of analyzing that rice. RiceTec, owned by Prince Hans-Adam of Liechtenstein, faced international outrage over allegations of biopiracy. It had also caused a brief diplomatic crisis between India and the United States, with India threatening to take the matter to the WTO as a violation of TRIPS, the Agreement on Trade-Related Aspects of Intellectual Property Rights. Both voluntarily and due to review decisions by the United States Patent and Trademark Office, RiceTec lost or withdrew most of the claims of the patent, including, most importantly, the right to call their rice products basmati.[53] A more limited varietal patent was granted to RiceTec in 2001 on claims dealing with three strains of the rice developed by the company.[54][55]",
    "Bhatura": " Bhatura (also known as batoora, bhatoora, batura, or pathora) (Hindi: \u092d\u091f\u0942\u0930\u093e, Punjabi: \u0a2d\u0a1f\u0a42\u0a30\u0a3e) is a fluffy deep-fried leavened sourdough bread originating from the Indian subcontinent.[1] It is commonly served as a midday meal or a breakfast dish in northern and eastern India.[1] Paired with chickpea curry (called chole or channe), it forms a traditional dish called chole bhature. This bread is like the puri bread but is made with leavened dough.[2] A typical recipe includes all-purpose flour (maida), dahi (yogurt), ghee or oil, and either yeast or baking powder. Once kneaded well, the dough is left to rise, and then small balls of this dough are either hand-rolled or flattened using a rolling pin. The bread pieces are then deep fried until they puff up into a lightly browned, soft, fluffy bread, which is elastic and chewy.[3] Bhatura is often eaten with yogurt, pickle, or vegetables. When eaten with chole, it forms a popular traditional dish known as chole bhature.[1][4] A variation of this dish is to use semolina flour instead of all purpose flour. [5] Other variations include aloo bhatura (bhatura filled with potato) and paneer bhatura (bhatura filled with paneer). A nonfried variant is the kulcha, which can be baked or cooked on a flat pan and is garnished with coriander leaves.  This Indian cuisine\u2013related article is a stub.

    "Bhel Puri": " Bhelpuri is a savoury snack originally from India, and is also a type of chaat. It is made of puffed rice, crumbled crunchy puri, onions, cilantro and tossed with two chutneys: a green spicy cilantro chutney[1] and a brown tangy tamarind chutney.[2][3] Bhel is often identified as a 'beach snack', strongly associated with the beaches of Mumbai, such as Chowpatty or Juhu.[4] One theory for its origin is that, it was invented at a restaurant called Vithal near Victoria Terminus. According to another theory, bhelpuri was conceived by the city's Marathi community, who made it by adding complex flavours to the simple North Indian chaat. Marathi housewives began making it and invented several varieties like the pakodi puri, and as it grew in popularity, many communities made their own regional variations.[5] The  Mumbai recipe has spread to most parts of India, where it has been modified to suit local food availability. Dry bhel is made from bhadang, a spicy namkeen (snack) from Western Maharashtra, and is consumed after garnishing with onions, coriander and lemon juice.[6] The Bengali variant of bhelpuri is called jhalmuri (meaning \"spicy puffed rice\") and bhelpuri refers to panipuri instead in that ethnicity.[7] A local Karnataka variant of bhelpuri is known as churumuri or churmuri.[8] The recipe exists in many parts of India. Bhelpuri is made from puffed rice and sev (a fried snack shaped like thin noodles made from besan flour) mixed with potatoes, onions, chat masala and chutney and a mixture of other fried snacks as the base of the snack.[9]  Bhelpuri has a balance of sweet, salty, tart and spicy flavors, with different textures as well, including crispy and crunchy from the puffed rice and fried sev. Other commonly used ingredients include tomatoes and  chillis added to the base. In northern India, recipes also include boiled potatoes cut into small pieces.[10]",
    "Biryani": "This is an accepted version of this page   Biryani (/b\u025c\u02d0r\u02c8j\u0251\u02d0ni/) is a mixed rice dish, mainly popular in South Asia. It is made with rice, some type of meat (chicken, goat, lamb, beef, prawn, or fish) and spices. To cater to vegetarians, in some cases, it is prepared by substituting vegetables or paneer for the meat.[1] Sometimes eggs or potatoes are also added.[2] Biryani is one of the most popular dishes in South Asia and among the South Asian diaspora, although the dish is often associated with the region's Muslim population in particular.[3] Similar dishes are also prepared in other parts of the world such as in  Iran, Iraq, Myanmar, Thailand, and Malaysia.[4] Biryani is the single most-ordered dish on Indian online food ordering and delivery services, and has been labelled as the most popular dish overall in India.[3][5] One theory states that it originated from birinj (Persian: \u0628\u0631\u0646\u062c), the Persian word for rice.[6][7] Another theory states that it is derived from biryan or beriyan (Persian: \u0628\u0631\u06cc\u0627\u0646), which means \"to fry\" or \"to roast\".[8][9] It may alternatively be related to the Persian word bereshtan (Persian: \u0628\u0631\u0634\u062a\u0646) which also means \"to roast (onions)\", as the dish is often prepared by flavouring rice with fried onions and meat, besides mild spices. The exact origin of the dish is uncertain, however, it is speculated to have originated in Persia, (now Iran) or South Asia. In North India, different varieties of biryani developed.[6][10] According to the historian Lizzie Collingham, the modern biryani developed in the royal kitchens of the Mughal Empire (1526\u20131857) and is a mix of the native spicy rice dishes of South Asia and the Persian polao.[11] Indian restaurateur Kris Dhillon believes that the dish originated in Persia and was brought to South Asia by the Mughals.[12] Salma Hossein, whom the BBC regards as the \"doyenne of Islamic cooking in India\", shares a similar view, asserting that biryani came to South Asia from Persia even before the Mughal era. Food scholar Pushpesh Pant also challenges the Mughal-origin claim, stating that it originated in Iran and that \"there is no evidence that biryani first came to this land with the Mughals. It is far more probable that it travelled with pilgrims and soldier-statesmen of noble descent to the Deccan region in South India\".[13] Another theory claims that the dish was prepared in South Asia before the first Mughal emperor Babur conquered India.[14] The 16th-century Mughal text Ain-i-Akbari makes no distinction between biryanis and pilaf (or pulao): it states that the word \"biryani\" is of older usage in India.[citation needed][15] A similar theory, that biryani came to India with Timur's invasion, appears to be incorrect because there is no record of biryani having existed in his native land during that period.[14] According to Pratibha Karan, who wrote the book Biryani, biryani is of Mughal origin, derived from pilaf varieties brought to the South Asian subcontinent by Arab and Persian traders. She speculates that the pulao was an army dish in medieval India. Armies would prepare a one-pot dish of rice with any available red meat. Over time, the dish became biryani due to different methods of cooking, with the distinction between \"pulao\" and \"biryani\" being arbitrary.[6][14] According to Vishwanath Shenoy, the owner of a biryani restaurant chain in India, one branch of biryani comes from the Mughals, while another was brought by the Arab traders to Malabar in South India.[16] There are various apocryphal stories dating the invention to Shah Jahan's time but Rana Safvi, the distinguished historian, says she could only find a recipe from the later Mughal period, from Bahadur Shah Zafar's time. It is not her claim that there was no biryani before that; just that she has not found a recipe. Other historians who have gone through texts say that the first references to biryani only appear around the 18th century.[17] Some claim that the dish \"oonchoru\" as mentioned in Sangam literature, which dates from between 200 BCE and 200 CE, is a predecessor of modern biryani. This dish, which was served to the soldiers of the Chera kings in Kerala, was said to be made of rice, ghee, meat, turmeric, coriander, pepper, and bay leaf.[18][19][20] The spices used in the preparation of South Indian biryanis, such as those used in the Malabar variety, are distinctive to the region and the Western Ghats. These spices are not found in the Middle East, Persia, or North India, underscoring the unique culinary heritage and local ingredients of South Indian biryani.[18][19][20] In South India, where rice is more widely used as a staple food, several distinct varieties of biryani emerged from Hyderabad in Telangana, Vijayawada in Andhra Pradesh, Mangalore and Bhatkal in Coastal Karnataka, Thalassery and Kozhikode in Malabar Kerala, as well as Ambur and Chettinad in Tamil Nadu.[6][10] Pilaf or pulao, as it is known on the Indian subcontinent, is another mixed rice dish popular in the cuisines of the Indian subcontinent, Central Asia, and Middle Eastern cuisine. Opinions differ on the differences between pulao and biryani, and whether actually there is a difference between the two.[21] According to Delhi-based historian Sohail Hashmi, pulao tends to be plainer than biryani, and consists of meat or vegetables cooked with rice with the bottom layered with potatoes or onions. Biryani contains more gravy (or yakhni), and is often cooked longer, leaving the meat (and vegetables, if present) more tender, and the rice more flavoured. Biryani is also cooked with additional dressings and often would have a light layer of scorched rice at the bottom.[22] Author Pratibha Karan states that while the terms are often applied arbitrarily, the main distinction is that a biryani consists of two layers of rice with a layer of meat (and vegetables, if present) in the middle, while the pulao is not layered.[14] Author Colleen Taylor Sen lists the following distinctions between biryani and pulao:[23] Ingredients for biryani vary according to the region and the type of meat and vegetables used. Meat (chicken, goat, beef, lamb,[26] prawn or fish) is the prime ingredient with rice. As is common in dishes of South Asia, vegetables are sometimes also used when preparing biryani. Corn may be used, depending on the season and availability. Navratan biryani tends to use sweeter, richer ingredients such as cashews, sultanas (kishmish), and fruits such as apples and pineapples.[22] The spices and condiments used in biryani may include fennel seeds, ghee (clarified butter), nutmeg, mace,[27] pepper, cloves,[27] cardamom, cinnamon, bay leaves, coriander, mint, ginger, onions, tomatoes, green chilies,[26] star anise, and garlic. The premium varieties include saffron.[27] Some commercial recipes for Biryani also include aromatic essences such as Mitha Ittar see attar, kewra and rose water. Dried sour prunes (Alu Bukhara) may also be added to the biryani. In nasi briyani and other variants made in Southeast Asian countries such as Malaysia, Singapore, and Indonesia, typical Southeast Asian spices and aromatics such as pandan leaf may be used alongside typical South Asian spices.[28] The main ingredient that usually accompanies the spices is chicken, lamb or goat meat; special varieties might use beef or seafood instead. The dish may be served with dahi chutney or raita, seekh kebab, Qorma, curry, a sour dish of aubergine (brinjal), boiled egg, and salad. Biryani can be cooked using one of two styles/techniques, pakki (\"cooked\") and kacchi (\"raw\").[29] There are many types of biryani, whose names are often based on their region of origin. For example, Sindhi biryani developed in the Sindh region of what is now Pakistan, and Hyderabadi biryani developed in the city of Hyderabad in South India. Some have taken the name of the shop that sells it, for example: Haji Biriyani, Haji Nanna Biriyani in Old Dhaka,[30] Fakhruddin Biriyani in Dhaka,[31][32] Students biryani in Karachi, Lucky biryani in Bandra, Mumbai and Baghdadi biryani in Colaba, Mumbai.[22] Biryanis are often specific to the Muslim communities where they originate; they are usually the defining dishes of those communities.[33] Ambur/Vaniyambadi biryani is a variety cooked in the neighboring towns of Ambur and Vaniyambadi in the Tirupattur district of the northeastern part of Tamil Nadu, which has a high Muslim population. It was introduced during the Nawabs of Arcot who once ruled the area. It is typically made with jeera samba rice.[34] Nowadays, it is popular as Ambur or Vaniyambadi style biryani as those are two prominent towns along the popular Bangalore to Chennai highway where travellers stop for eating.[35] The Ambur/Vaniyambadi biryani is accompanied by dhalcha, a sour brinjal curry, and pachadi or raitha (sliced onions mixed with plain yogurt, tomato, chilies, and salt). It has a distinctive aroma and is considered light on the stomach.[citation needed] The usage of spice is moderate, and curd is used as a gravy base. It also has a higher ratio of meat to rice.[15] Ambur-style biriyani is popular as street food all across South India. This is an integral part of the Navayath cuisine and a specialty of Bhatkal, a coastal town in Karnataka. Its origins are traced to the Persian traders who introduced biryani along with kababs and Indian breads. In Bhatkali biryani, the meat is cooked in an onion and green chili-based masala and layered with fragrant rice. It has a unique spicy and heady flavour, and the rice is overwhelmingly white with mild streaks of orange. Its variations include beef, goat, chicken, titar (Partridge), egg, fish, crab, prawn, and vegetable biryani. Though similar to those in Thalassery, this biryani differs with lingering after-notes of mashed onions laced with garlic[citation needed]. A few chilies and spices littered with curry leaves lends a unique flavour to Bhatkal biryani. No oil is used.[36] Bohri biryani, prepared by the Bohris is flavoured with lots of tomatoes.[16] It is popular in Karachi. Chettinad biryani is famous in the Indian state of Tamil Nadu. It is made of jeeraka samba rice, and smells of spices and ghee. It is best taken with nenju elumbu kuzhambu, a spicy and tangy goat meat gravy [citation needed]. The podi kozhi is usually topped with fried onions and curry leaves.[37][38][39][40] Degh ki biryani is a typical biryani made from small cubes of beef or mutton. This biryani originated in Ahmadnagar Sultanate and is famous in Parbhani in Marathwada region and generally served at weddings. The meat is flavoured with ginger, garlic, red chili, cumin, garam masala, fried onion and curd. This biryani is also known as kachay gosht ki biryani or dum biryani, where the meat is marinated and cooked along with short-grained and fine rice. It is left on a slow fire or dum for a fragrant and aromatic flavour. The Delhi version of biryani developed a unique local flavour as the Mughal kings shifted their political capital to the North Indian city of Delhi. Until the 1950s, most people cooked biryani in their home and rarely ate at eateries outside of their homes. Hence, restaurants primarily catered to travellers and merchants. Any region that saw more of these two classes of people nurtured more restaurants, and thus their own versions of biryani. This is the reason why most shops that sold biryani in Delhi, tended to be near mosques such as Jama Masjid (for travellers) or traditional shopping districts (such as Chandni Chowk).[citation needed] Each part of Delhi has its own style of biryani, often based on its original purpose, thus giving rise to Nizamuddin biryani, Shahjahanabad biryani, etc.[citation needed]  Nizamuddin biryani usually had little expensive meat and spices as it was primarily meant to be made in bulk for offering at the Nizamuddin Dargah shrine and thereafter to be distributed to devotees.[22] A non-dum biryani, using many green chillies, popularized by the Babu Shahi Bawarchi shops located outside the National Sports Club in Delhi is informally called Babu Shahi biryani. Another version of Delhi biryani uses achaar (pickles) and is called achaari biryani.[41] The city of Dhaka in Bangladesh used to be the capital of Bengal Subah and is known for Dhakaiya Kacchi Biryani, a Chevon Biryani made with highly seasoned rice and goat meat. The recipe includes: highly seasoned rice, goat meat, mustard oil, garlic, onion, black pepper, saffron, clove, cardamom, cinnamon, salt, lemon, doi, peanuts, cream, raisins and a small amount of cheese (either from cows or buffalo). It is accompanied by borhani, a salted mint drink made of yogurt, coriander, mint and salt. Haji biryani is a favourite among Bangladeshis living abroad.[42] A recipe was handed down by the founder of one Dhaka restaurant to the next generation. Haji Mohammad Shahed claimed, \"I have never changed anything, not even the amount of salt\".[43] Bengali style biryani often includes potatoes. The city of Dindigul in Tamil Nadu is noted for its biryani, which uses a little curd and lemon juice for a tangy taste.[44] Military hotels of Bangalore in Karnataka are known for selling Biryani served in dried leaf bowl called Donne.[45] It is typically made from jeera samba rice, yogurt with lot of common mint and coriander leaves.[46][47] Hyderabadi biryani is India's most famous biryani; some say biryani is synonymous with Hyderabad.[48] Hyderabadi biryani developed in Hyderabad Subah under the rule of Asaf Jah I, who was first appointed as the governor of Deccan by the Mughal Emperor Aurangzeb. It is made with basmati rice, spices and goat meat. Popular variations use chicken instead of goat meat. There are various forms of Hyderabadi biryani, such as kachay gosht ki biryani or dum biryani, where goat meat is marinated and cooked along with the rice. It is left on a slow fire or dum for a fragrant and aromatic flavour.[49] Memoni biryani is an extremely spicy variety developed by the Memons of Gujarat-Sindh region in India and Pakistan.[16] It is made with mutton, dahi, fried onions, and potatoes, and fewer tomatoes compared to Sindhi biryani. Kalyani biryani is a beef biryani from the former state of Hyderabad Deccan.[50] Also known as the \"poor man's\"  Hyderabadi biryani, Kalyani biryani is made from small cubes of buffalo meat or cow meat.[51][52] The meat is flavoured with ginger, garlic, turmeric, red chili, cumin, coriander powder, and lots of onion and tomato. It is first cooked as a thick curry and then cooked along with rice. Then given dum (the Indian method of steaming in a covered pot). It has a distinct tomato, jeera and dhania flavour.[53] Kalyani biryani is supposed to have originated in Bidar during the reign of the Kalyani Nawabs, who migrated to Hyderabad in mid 18th century after one of the Nawabs, Ghazanfur Jang married into the Asaf Jahi family uniting their realms.[citation needed] Kalyani biryani was served by the Kalyani Nawabs to all of their subjects who came from Bidar to Hyderabad and stayed or visited their devdi or noble mansion. Calcutta or Kolkata biryani evolved from Dhakaiya biryani and the Lucknow style biryani when Awadh's last Nawab, Wajid Ali Shah, was exiled in 1856 to the Kolkata suburb of Metiabruz. Shah brought his personal chef with him. Like Dhakaiya biryani, the Kolkata biriyani is characterized by the presence of potato in it.[16] Lucknow was a capital of Awadh Subah. For Lucknow/ avadhi biryani, basmati rice is cooked in ghee with warm, aromatic spices and then layered with a type of meat curry or marinade, sealed, and cooked over low heat until done.[54][55] A specialty of the Beary Muslim community in coastal Karnataka and is also known as Manglorean-style biryani. The dish is made using lots of green chilly and coconut and has the subtle flavor and aroma of fennel. Spices that include nutmeg, mint leaves, fennel seeds, mace (javitri), poppy seeds, almonds, star anise and others. The rice and meat (mutton, chicken, beef) are cooked separately and then layered and slowly cooked together again. This dish is highly served during marriages and other homely occasions. This type of biryani is popular in the Palakkad and Coimbatore regions. This was most commonly prepared by Rowther families in Kerala and Tamil Nadu. This type of biryani is cooked in a different style. Goat meat is most commonly used and it is entirely different from Malabar biryani.[citation needed] The exotic and aromatic Sindhi biryani, originating in the former Mughal subah based in Thatta is known in Pakistan for its spicy taste, fragrant rice, and delicate meat. Sindhi biryani is a beloved staple in food menus of Pakistani and Sindhi cuisine. Sindhi biryani is prepared with meat and a mixture of basmati rice, vegetables, and various spices. Biryani was introduced in the 1900s to Sri Lanka by the Indian Muslims who engaged in trade within the country.[citation needed]  In many cases, Sri Lankan biryani is spicier than most Indian varieties. Side dishes may include Malay pickle, Cashew curry and Mint sambol.[citation needed] Thalassery biryani is the variation of biryani found in the Indian state of Kerala. It is one of the many dishes of the Kerala Muslim community, and very popular.[56] The ingredients are chicken, spices and the specialty is the choice of rice called khyma. Khyma rice is generally mixed with ghee. Although a large number of spices such as mace, cashew nuts, sultana raisins, fennel-cumin seeds, tomato, onion, ginger, garlic, shallot, cloves and cinnamon are used,[57] there is only a small amount of chili (or chili powder) used in its preparation. A pakki biryani, the Thalassery biryani uses a small-grained thin (not round) fragrant variety of rice known as khyma or jeerakasala. The dum method of preparation (sealing the lid with dough [maida] or cloth and placing red-hot charcoal above the lid) is applied here to avoid scorched rice. In Kerala, another variety called beef biryani is well known.[58] In Myanmar (Burma), biryani is known in Burmese as danpauk or danbauk (\u1012\u1036\u1015\u1031\u102b\u1000\u103a), derived from the Persian term dum pukht, which refers to a slow oven cooking technique. Danbauk is a mainstay at festive events such as Thingyan, weddings and donation feasts.[59][60] Given danbauk's South Asian origins, danbauk restaurants and chains have traditionally been owned by Muslims, but in recent decades Buddhist entrepreneurs have entered the market.[59] Featured ingredients include: cashew nuts, yogurt, raisins and peas, chicken, cloves, cinnamon, saffron and bay leaf cooked in long-grain rice.[61] In danbauk, chicken specially seasoned with a danbauk masala spice mix,[62] is cooked with the rice.[63] Danbauk is typically eaten with a number of side dishes, including a fresh salad of sliced onions, julienned cabbage, sliced cucumbers, fermented limes and lemons, fried dried chilies, and soup.[64] In recent decades, danbauk restaurants have innovated variations, including \"ambrosia\" biryani (\u1014\u1010\u103a\u101e\u102f\u1013\u102c\u1011\u1019\u1004\u103a\u1038), which features dried fruits and buttered rice.[64] In Iraq and in the states of the Persian Gulf, biryani (\u0628\u0631\u064a\u0627\u0646\u064a: \"biryani\") is usually saffron-based with chicken usually being the meat or poultry of choice. It is popular throughout Iraq, especially in the Kurdistan Region.  Most variations also include vermicelli, fried onions, fried potato cubes, almonds, and raisins spread liberally over the rice.[16] Sometimes, a sour/spicy tomato sauce is served on the side (maraq). In Iran, during the Safavid dynasty (1501\u20131736), a dish called Beriyan Polo (Nastaliq script: \u0628\u0631\u06cc\u0627\u0646 \u067e\u0644\u0648) was made with lamb or chicken, marinated overnight\u2014with yogurt, herbs, spices, dried fruits like raisins, prunes or pomegranate seeds\u2014and later cooked in a tannour oven, then served with steamed rice.[citation needed] A different dish called biryan is popular in Afghanistan. Biryan traces its origins to the same source as biryani, when most of Afghanistan was part of Kabul and Qandahar Subahs and as today sold in Afghanistan as well as in Bhopal, India. Biryan is prepared by cooking gosht and rice together, but without the additional gravy (yakhni) and other condiments that are used in biryani. The Delhi-based historian Sohail Hashmi refers to the biryan as midway between pulao and biryani.  Afghan biryani tends to use much dry fruit such as raisins and lesser amounts of meat, often cut into tiny pieces.[22] Nasi kebuli is an Indonesian spicy steamed rice dish[65] cooked in goat meat broth, milk and ghee.[66] Nasi kebuli is descended from kabuli palaw which is an Afghani rice dish, similar to biryani served in the Indian subcontinent.[67] Although Indonesia has authentic nasi kebuli, Indonesia also inherited and has local-style of biryani which is known as nasi biryani or nasi briyani. Nasi biryani is popular among and often associated as Acehnese, Arab Indonesian, Indian Indonesian and Malay cuisine.[68] The Malaysian and Singaporean variety of biryani is called nasi briyani or nasi biryani. Although authentic styles of biryani from South India are popular, nasi briyani remains the most popular. The key differences between nasi briyani and Indian biryanis are that the meat in nasi briyani is cooked separately from the rice, and there is more curry, sauce, or gravy present in the nasi briyani than in Indian biryanis.[69] Nasi briyani dishes are very popular in Malaysia and Singapore. As an important part of Malaysian and Singaporean Indian cuisines, they are popularized through mamak stalls, hawker centres, and food courts as well as fine dining restaurants. There are also eateries that sell pork as the main meat of the dish in Singapore.[70][71] Biryani dishes are very popular in Mauritius, especially at Muslim weddings and festivities. It is also widely available at street food places. Mauritian biryanis are often accompanied by an achaar (mango pickles), chilies and salads. Kapampangan cuisine of the Philippines (often in Pampanga) features a special dish called nasing biringyi (chicken saffron rice), that is typically prepared only during special occasions such as weddings, family get-togethers or fiestas. It is not a staple of the Filipino diet as it is difficult to prepare compared to other usual dishes. Nasing biringyi is similar to the nasi briyani dish of Malaysia in style and taste. A version that has merged with the Filipino version of the Spanish paella is known as bringhe.[72] In the Cape Malay culture, a variation of biryani incorporates lentils as a key ingredient in the dish along with meat (usually beef, chicken, seafood or vegetables). The dish is made by cooking the rice and legumes and meat and gravy separately, then mixing it. Uncommonly, it is made using the dum-cooking method. The spices are similar to those used in the original Indian biryani. Variants of biryani exist in the cuisines of Somalia, Kenya, and Tanzania due to centuries of trade between the East African coast and South Asia for centuries, and the more recent migration of Indians to the latter two countries more recently during the British colonial era. Zanzibar has its own form of biryani characterized by the mixture of East African and Indian spices, as well as influences from Arab cuisine. The meat used is most commonly chicken.[73] This variant is similar to the forms of biryani served in Kenya. In Somalia, the descendant of biryani is bariis iskukaris. It is served with chicken, goat, beef, lamb, or camel meat, and spiced with the Somali spice mixture xawaash and other spices. A unique characteristic of bariis and other Somali dishes is the addition of banana on the side to be mixed with the dish. Biryani in Thailand is commonly known as khao mhok (Thai: \u0e02\u0e49\u0e32\u0e27\u0e2b\u0e21\u0e01). It is commonly paired with chicken, beef or even fish and topped with fried garlic. The dish is common in Thai cuisine and is often served with a green sour sauce. Tehari and tehri are various names for the vegetarian adaptation of Biryani but are mainly classified as pulao. It was developed for the Hindu bookkeepers of the Muslim Nawabs. It is prepared by adding potatoes to the rice, as opposed to the case of biryani, where the rice is added to the meat. In Kashmir, tehari is sold as street food. Tehari became more popular during World War II, when meat prices increased substantially and potatoes became the popular substitute in biryani. Hot",
    "Black-Eyed Peas": " The Black Eyed Peas are an American musical group from Los Angeles, composed of rappers will.i.am, apl.de.ap and Taboo. The group's lineup during the height of their popularity in the 2000s[5] featured Fergie, who replaced original member Kim Hill in 2002. They have sold an estimated 80 million records, making them one of the best-selling musical acts of all time,[6] and were ranked 12th on Billboard's 2000s Decade-End Artist of the Decade Chart and 7th on the Hot 100 Artists of the Decade. Formed in 1995 as an alternative hip hop trio, they signed with Interscope Records to release two albums\u2014Behind the Front (1998) and Bridging the Gap (2000)\u2014before rebranding to a more marketable pop-rap act; their third album, Elephunk (2003), became the group's commercial breakthrough.[4] Elephunk was preceded by the group's first hit song, the 2003 single \"Where Is the Love?\" (featuring Justin Timberlake). It peaked atop music charts in 13 countries, including the United Kingdom, where it spent seven weeks at number one and became the country's biggest-selling single of that year. Their fourth album, Monkey Business (2005), was met with continued commercial success; it received triple platinum certification by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA) and peaked at number two on the Billboard 200. The group's fifth album, The E.N.D. (2009), yielded their furthest commercial success; it peaked atop the Billboard 200 and spawned three Billboard Hot 100-number one singles: \"Imma Be\", \"Boom Boom Pow\" and \"I Gotta Feeling\". For one week, the latter two songs made the group one of the 11 musical acts to have simultaneously held the top two spots on the Billboard Hot 100, where they remained for a then-record 26 consecutive weeks. Two other singles from the album, \"Rock That Body\" and \"Meet Me Halfway\", peaked within the top ten of the chart. \"I Gotta Feeling\" became the first single to sell over than one million downloads in the United Kingdom.[7] At the 52nd Grammy Awards ceremony, the group won three awards from six nominations. The group's sixth album, The Beginning (2010), released the following year, and spawned the Billboard Hot 100-top five singles \"The Time (Dirty Bit)\" and \"Just Can't Get Enough\". In February 2011, they performed in the Super Bowl XLV halftime show. In 2011, the Black Eyes Peas announced they would be going on indefinite hiatus to pursue other activities, briefly reuniting in 2015. Fergie was announced to have left the group in 2018, and was replaced by J. Rey Soul for touring that same year. Soul appeared as a featured artist on select tracks on the group's seventh album, Masters of the Sun Vol. 1 (2018), which failed to chart. They followed this with the albums Translation (2020) and Elevation (2022), which delved into reggaeton and Latin influences. In 1988, while attending two different high schools, William James Adams Jr and Allan Pineda Lindo Jr met at the all-ages dance venue Club What? in Los Angeles. They formed a hip-hop dance and music crew named Tribal Nation. Adams took the stage name Will 1X while Pineda Lindo adopted the name apl.de.ap. Their friends joined the group \u2013 Dante Santiago and Mooky Mook, followed shortly by DJ Motiv8. Actor David Faustino opened an all-ages club named Balistyx in 1991 inside the old Whisky a Go Go, and Tribal Nation played there. Rapper Eazy-E caught their show and signed the group to Ruthless Records, changing the group name to Atban Klann. Their first album project, Grass Roots, was shelved at the end of 1993, never to be released. They released a promo song \"Let Me Get Down\" in 1994, billed as being produced by the Black Eyed Peas: the production team of DJ Motiv8 and Will 1X. Mooky Mook left the group in 1995, and Eazy-E died of HIV/AIDS. The group's contract with Ruthless was stalled, so Santiago also left the group. Will 1X changed his stage name to will.i.am.[8] In 1995, will.i.am and apl.de.ap formed a new group named Black Eyed Pods with Jaime Gomez (Taboo), and Kim Hill, a singer who featured on a selected number of their tracks. They later changed \"Pods\" to \"Peas\".[9] Unlike the \"gangsta rap\" sounds of Los Angeles\u2013based hip hop acts at the time, the trio performed with a live band and adopted a conscious musical and appearance style. After being signed to Interscope Records and releasing their debut, Behind the Front (1998) the group (and their accompanying live band) earned critical acclaim. One of the singles from the album was \"Joints & Jam\", and was featured on the Bulworth soundtrack. Singer Sierra Swan appeared as a guest on the 1998 song \"Fallin' Up\". Their second album, Bridging the Gap (2000), produced the singles \"Weekends\" featuring Esthero and \"Request + Line\" featuring R&B singer Macy Gray. Hill left the band while producing the album, but was still featured on the album tracks for \"Hot\" and \"Tell Your Mama Come\" as well as in the video for \"Weekends\". In 2002, Stacy Ferguson was chosen as the lead singer, after being introduced to the band by Santiago.[10] Their new album, Elephunk, indicated a shift to a polished pop sound designed to attract mass audiences. In a positive review of the Black Eyed Peas' new-found style, Rolling Stone noted that after the group \"hired a blond bombshell named Stacy 'Fergie' Ferguson and gave up their pursuit of backpack-rapper cred, they have made a kind of spiritual practice of recording futuristic songs \u2013 a total aesthetic commitment that extends from their garish wardrobes to their United Colors of Benetton worldview.\"[11] From Elephunk came \"Where Is the Love?\", which became the Black Eyed Peas' first major hit, peaking at No. 8 on the U.S. Hot 100. It was more successful abroad, topping the charts in several other countries, including seven weeks at No. 1 in the United Kingdom, where it became the biggest-selling single of 2003. The single had similar results in Australia, staying at No. 1 for six weeks. In an interview with TalkofFame.com, Taboo shared that Justin Timberlake's split with Britney Spears impacted the recording of \"Where Is the Love?\".[12] The album subsequently spawned \"Shut Up\", which peaked at No. 2 in the UK and topped the charts and went gold and platinum in the U.S., UK, Germany, and other European markets. The third single from the album, although significantly restyled from the original Elephunk version, \"Hey Mama\" hit the top 5 in Australia and the top 10 in the UK, Germany and other European countries and reached No. 23 in the U.S. The song received even more exposure in 2003 when it was featured in the first \"silhouette\" television commercial for the iPod. The fourth single from the album was \"Let's Get It Started\". It won a 2005 Grammy for Best Rap Performance by a Duo or Group and also received two nominations for Record of the Year and Best Rap Song. In 2004, the Black Eyed Peas embarked on their international Elephunk Tour, touring many countries in Europe, Africa, and Asia. Their fourth album, Monkey Business, was recorded through 2004 and was released on May 25, 2005. Much of the pre-production writing was performed on the John Lennon Educational Tour Bus while on the Black Eyed Peas tour of 2004. The album's first single, \"Don't Phunk with My Heart\", was a hit in the U.S., reaching number three on the Billboard Hot 100. This Billboard status was the highest peak yet of their career in the U.S. (this was later broken when \"Boom Boom Pow\" peaked at the top spot of the Billboard Hot 100) and earned them another Grammy for Best Rap Performance by a Duo or Group. The song reached three in the UK, and five in Canada, and stayed at number one for three weeks in Australia. Some radio stations, concerned about complaints of obscenity, played an alternative version, \"Don't Mess with My Heart\". \"Don't Lie\", the second single from the album, saw success on the U.S. Hot 100, reaching No. 14, although becoming somewhat more successful in the UK and Australia, reaching a peak of No. 6 in both countries. \"My Humps\", another song from the album, immediately achieved commercial success in the U.S. and also garnered fairly substantial radio play despite the sexually suggestive lyrics. It reached number three on the U.S. Hot 100 and number one in Australia, making it their fourth Australian number one single. However, many mocked the song for its poor lyrical content. For instance, John Bush, writing for AllMusic, described it as \"one of the most embarrassing rap performances of the new millennium\".[13] Despite this, the album Monkey Business debuted at number two on the U.S. Billboard 200 albums chart, selling over 295,000 copies in its first week and was later certified 3\u00d7 platinum by the RIAA. Their next and final commercially released single from the album was \"Pump It\", which borrows much of its sound from \"Misirlou\", specifically Dick Dale's version. The track peaked at number 8 in Australia and number 18 in the U.S. In September 2005, the Black Eyed Peas released an iTunes Originals playlist of their greatest hits, as well as some that were re-recorded specially available for purchase through iTunes. The playlist includes popular songs such as \"Don't Lie\", \"Shut Up\", and a new version of \"Where Is the Love?\". It has small stories containing info and commentary about the songs and how the group first met. In autumn 2005, the Black Eyed Peas set off to tour with Gwen Stefani as supporting act.

Following its release, will.i.am remarked that the album had been inspired by a trip to Australia, specifically the sound of The Presets' \"My People\". \"The energy on the Presets' small little stage was crazy energy.

    "Boiled Rice": "Cooked rice refers to rice that has been cooked either by steaming or boiling. The terms steamed rice or boiled rice are also commonly used. Any variant of Asian rice (both Indica and Japonica varieties), African rice or wild rice, glutinous or non-glutinous, long-, medium-, or short-grain, of any colour, can be used. Rice for cooking can be whole grain or milled. Cooked rice is used as a base for various fried rice dishes (e.g. ch\u01ceof\u00e0n, khao phat), rice bowls/plates (e.g. bibimbap, chazuke, curry rice, dal bhat, donburi, loco moco, panta bhat, rice and beans, rice and gravy), rice porridges (e.g. congee, juk), rice balls/rolls (e.g. gimbap, onigiri, sushi, zongzi), as well as rice cakes and desserts (e.g. mochi, tteok, yaksik). Rice is a staple food in not only Asia and Latin America, but across the globe, and is the most consumed foodstuff in the world. The U.S. Department of Agriculture classifies rice as part of the grains food group. Nutritionally, 200\u00a0g of cooked steamed white rice contributes 60\u00a0g (2\u00a0oz) toward the daily recommended 170 and 200\u00a0g (6 and 7\u00a0oz) of grains for women and men, respectively, and is considered a good source of micronutrients such as zinc and manganese.[2] Rice is often rinsed and soaked before being cooked. Unpolished brown rice requires longer soaking time than milled white rice does. The amount of water added can vary depending on many factors. In most cases, double water in proportion to rice is added depending on the variety of rice and the container it is contained, high cylindrical container is an example. Newly harvested rice usually requires less water,[3] and softer varieties need more water than firmer varieties. Rice can be boiled in a heavy-bottomed cookware or steamed in a food steamer. Some boiling methods do not require precise water measurements, as the rice is strained after boiling.[4] This draining method is suitable for the less glutinous varieties such as basmati rice, but not-suitable for varieties like japonica rice which become sticky to some degree when cooked. Optionally, a small amount of salt can be added before cooking. If not drained, boiled rice is usually cooked on high heat until a rolling boil, then simmered with the lid on, and steamed over the residual heat after turning off the heat. Nowadays, electric rice cookers are also commonly used to cook rice. During cooking, rice absorbs water and increase in volume and mass. In East Asia, cooked rice is most commonly served in individual bowls, with each diner receiving one. Food from local dishes is placed upon the rice, and is then eaten. Cooked or boiled rice is used as an ingredient in many dishes. Leftover steamed rice is used to make porridge or fried rice dishes. Some common dishes using cooked rice as the main ingredient include: Most common is plain, steamed white rice; however, a number of varieties and are served, many with specific cooking methods. Some varieties include:",
    "Bread Pudding": "Bread pudding is a bread-based dessert popular in many countries' cuisines. It is made with stale bread and milk or cream, generally containing eggs, a form of fat such as oil, butter or suet and, depending on whether the pudding is sweet or savory, a variety of other ingredients. Sweet bread puddings may use sugar, syrup, honey, dried fruit, nuts, as well as spices such as cinnamon, nutmeg, mace, or vanilla. The bread is soaked in the liquids, mixed with the other ingredients, and baked. Savory puddings like breakfast strata may be served as main courses, while sweet puddings are typically eaten as desserts. In other languages, its name is a translation of \"bread pudding\" or even just \"pudding\", for example \"pud\u00edn\" or \"bud\u00edn\".[1][2] In the Philippines, banana bread pudding is popular. In Mexico, there is a similar dish eaten during Lent called capirotada.[3][4] In Liverpool in the United Kingdom, a moist version of Nelson cake, itself a bread pudding, is nicknamed \"Wet Nelly\".[5][6] Bread pudding originated with 11th-century English cooks who repurposed leftover stale bread. In the following centuries, the dish became known as \"poor man's pudding\" because of the scarcity of food at the time, with the pudding being made only with boiling water, sugar, and spices.[7][8][better\u00a0source\u00a0needed] It was only in the 13th century that eggs and milk were added to the recipe, which then became known as \"bread and butter pudding\".[8] The 18th-century English cookbook The Compleat Housewife contains two recipes for baked bread pudding. The first is identified as \"A Bread and Butter Pudding for Fasting Days\". To make the pudding a baking dish is lined with puff pastry, and slices of penny loaf with butter, raisins and currants, and pieces of butter are added in alternating layers. Over this is poured thickened, spiced cream and orange blossom water, and the dish is baked in the oven. There is another version of the dish that is simpler, omitting the spices and dried fruits. With the arrival of the first settlers in the 13 English Colonies in America, bread pudding became popular in the colonies and later in the United States.[8] In Belgium, particularly Brussels, bread pudding is baked with brown sugar, cinnamon, stale bread, and raisins or apple.[9] In Canada, bread pudding is sometimes made with maple syrup.[10] In Hong Kong, bread pudding is usually served with vanilla cream dressing.[11][better\u00a0source\u00a0needed] In Hungary, it is called M\u00e1glyarak\u00e1s (literally, \"bonfire\") which is baked with whipped egg whites on top.[12] In Malaysia, bread pudding is eaten with custard sauce.[citation needed] In Mecklenburg-Vorpommern, Germany, black bread is used to make \"black bread pudding\" (Schwarzbrotpudding).[13] In the Philippines, stale unsold bread are commonly used by bakeries to make the characteristically bright red filling of pan de regla.[14] In the United States, especially Louisiana, bread puddings are typically sweet and served as dessert with a sweet sauce of some sort, such as whiskey sauce, rum sauce, or caramel sauce, but typically sprinkled with sugar and eaten warm in squares or slices. Sometimes, bread pudding is served warm topped with or alongside a dollop of whipped cream or a scoop of vanilla ice cream.[15] In Puerto Rico, there are many variations of bread pudding on the island. Cream cheese with lime zest and guava or coconut-sweet plantain with rum raisins is perhaps the most popular. Bread pudding is always made with a variety of spices. Puerto Rican bread pudding is cooked the same as cr\u00e8me caramel with caramel poured into a baking dish and then the pudding mix is poured on top. The baking dish is placed in a bain-marie and then in the oven.[16] In Argentina, Peru, Paraguay, and Uruguay, bread pudding is known as \"bud\u00edn de pan\".[17][18] In Brazil, bread pudding is known as \"pudim de p\u00e3o\". The dish consists of bread, eggs, milk, condensed milk, butter, vanilla extract, and a pinch of cinnamon (optional). However, all the ingredients are mixed together in a blender and poured into a bundt-like mold (with a hole in the middle) lined with caramelized sugar syrup, which is then baked in a water bath for about 1 hour and a half. Afterwards, it is left to cool before unmolding and serving. When ready, its appearance can be compared to a creamy yet dense flan.[19] In Panama, bread pudding is known as \"mamallena\".[20] In Aruba, bread pudding is known as \"pan bolo\".[citation needed] In Cuba, bread pudding is known as \"pud\u00edn de pan\" and many serve it with a guava marmalade.[1] In Chile, bread pudding is known as \"colegial\" or \"bud\u00edn de pan\".[2] In Mexico it is simply known as \"bud\u00edn\" and is usually made with bolillo leftovers. It's typically made with raisins and pecans. In Czech Republic and Slovakia bread pudding is known as \"\u017eem\u013eovka\" and is most commonly made of apples, raisins and rohl\u00edks or veka, soaked in sweet milk with whipped egg whites on top. In Southeast Asian regions like Malaysia, Singapore, and Indonesia, bread pudding is sometimes found in local dessert shops. To cater to local preferences, it may incorporate ingredients such as coconut milk, pandan leaves, palm sugar, and tropical fruits. In Turkey, bread pudding is known as ekmek kaday\u0131f\u0131 and served with a slice of kaymak or ice cream on top of the cake which is garnished with ground pistachio or shredded coconut. In Myanmar, bread pudding known as \"Pu Tin\" in Burmese has been a popular dessert since colonial times. It is also added to a desert known as Falooda.[21] In Bangladesh, a variation of bread pudding called Shahi Tukra, has existed in the region since Mughal times. Shahi Tukra (also spelled Tukda) is known in Hyderabad as Double Ka Meetha.",
    "Brown Rice": "Brown rice is a whole grain rice with the inedible outer hull removed. This kind of rice sheds its outer hull or husk but the bran and germ layer remain on, constituting the brown or tan colour of rice. White rice is the same grain without the hull, the bran layer, and the cereal germ. Red rice, gold rice, and black rice (also called purple rice) are all whole rices with differently pigmented outer layers. Brown rice generally needs longer cooking times than white rice, unless it is broken or flour blasted (which perforates the bran without removing it).[1] Studies in 2003 estimated a cooking time between 35 and 51 minutes.[2] A shorter cooking time is necessary for \"converted\" or parboiled rice.[3] Brown rice has a shelf life of approximately 6 months,[4] but hermetic storage, refrigeration or freezing can significantly extend its lifetime. Freezing, even periodically, can also help control infestations of Indian meal moths. Cooked, long-grain brown rice is 70% water, 26% carbohydrates, 3% protein, and 1% fat. In a reference amount of 100 grams (3.5\u00a0oz), cooked brown rice supplies 123 calories of food energy, and is a rich source (20% or more of the Daily Value, DV) of manganese (36% DV) and moderate source (11-17% DV) of magnesium, phosphorus, niacin, and thiamine. Arsenic is in the natural environment and may be present in common grains, such as brown rice.[7] Although rice may absorb arsenic more readily than other crops, rice remains as a staple of a well-balanced diet, particularly when fortified with micronutrients in infant rice cereal.[8] Cooking brown rice in hot water can reduce the content of inorganic arsenic by 40-60%, although this cooking method also diminishes the content of micronutrients.[8] Brown rice is widely cultivated in Vietnam,[9][10] mainly in the northern and central provinces.[11][12] According to statistics from the Ministry of Agriculture and Rural Development, the area of brown rice cultivation in Vietnam in 2023 reached 150,000 hectares,[13][14][15] with a production of 1.2 million tons. Brown rice has high economic value and is popular in the market.[16][17] The price of brown rice is usually higher than white rice by 10-20%.[18][19] Brown rice has great potential for development in Vietnam,[20][21][22] and could become a major export product.[23][24]",
    "Burfi": " Barfi[a] or burfi is a milk-based sweet from the Indian subcontinent with a fudge-like consistency. Its name comes from the Persian and Urdu word (barf) for snow. Barfi is consumed throughout India and Pakistan and is especially popular in North India. It is often served at celebrations and religious festivals such as Diwali and Holi.[1][2][3] Barfi originated in Persia and was introduced to India by the Mughal Empire in the 16th century.[2][4] Through indentured workers it was brought to Trinidad in the mid-19th century and became popular there.[5] To prepare barfi, khoa (condensed milk) and granulated sugar are mixed and cooked together. When the mixture thickens to a fudge-like consistency, it is spread onto a greased plate. After cooling, it is cut into squares, diamonds, or circles. It can also be formed into balls, layered, or rolled into multicolored slices. When served at special occasions, it is often decorated with vark (edible silver foil). It can also be decorated with coconut, ground nuts, or powdered milk.[1][2][3] Fruit, nuts, legumes, spices, and other flavorings may be added to the khoa-sugar mixture and yield different varieties of barfi.  Commonly added fruits include guava and melon seeds. Typical nuts added include almonds,  cashews, coconut, and pistachios. Mung beans are sometimes added and yield moong dal barfi. Common flavorings and spices include cardamom, kewra (fragrant screwpine), orange, mango, saffron, rosewater, and vanilla. Food colorings may also be added.[1][2][3]",
    "Butter Chicken": "Butter chicken, traditionally known as murgh makhani (pronounced [m\u028ar\u0263 \u02c8m\u0259k\u02b0a\u02d0ni]), is an Indian dish originating in Delhi.[1][2] It is a type of curry made from chicken with a spiced tomato and butter (makhan) sauce. Its sauce is known for its rich texture. It is similar to chicken tikka masala, which uses a tomato paste.[6] The curry was developed at the Moti Mahal restaurant in the Daryaganj neighbourhood of Old Delhi in the 1950s, after the Partition of India[7] by Kundan Lal Jaggi and Kundan Lal Gujral,[8] who were both Punjabi refugees from Peshawar, British India.[9][10][2] The curry was made \"by chance\" by mixing leftover tandoori chicken in a tomato gravy, rich in butter (makhan).[11] In 1974, a recipe was published for \"Murgh makhanii (Tandoori chicken cooked in butter and tomato sauce)\".[citation needed] In 1975, the English phrase \"butter chicken\" curry first appeared in print, as a specialty of the house at Gaylord Indian restaurant in Manhattan.[12] In Toronto and the Caribbean, it can be found as a filling in pizza, poutine, wraps, roti, or rolls,[13] while in Australia and New Zealand, it is also eaten as a pie filling.[14][15][16][17] The curry is common in India, Bangladesh, Pakistan, and many other countries where a South Asian diaspora is present.[18][19][13][20][21] Due to its popularity outside of India, it is sometimes mistakenly believed to be of Western origin (like chicken tikka masala, which it is also sometimes confused with).[22] In 2024, the family of Gujral (who run Moti Mahal) sued the family of Jaggi (who run a rival restaurant) in a dispute over credit for inventing the dish.[23] Chicken is marinated for several hours in a mixture of lemon juice, dahi (yogurt), Kashmiri red chilli, salt, garam masala, ginger paste, and garlic paste. The marinated chicken is cooked in a tandoor (traditional clay oven), but may be grilled, oven-roasted, or pan-fried. It is served in a mild curry sauce that includes butter. The sauce is a tomato, garlic, and ginger-based sauce that is simmered until smooth and much of the water has evaporated. There are many variations on the composition and spicing of the sauce, which is sieved so that it is velvety smooth. Spices may include cardamom, cumin, cloves, cinnamon, coriander, pepper, garam masala, and fenugreek (Punjabi/Hindi: kasuri methi). Cashew paste may be used as a thickener and it is finally garnished with coriander.",
    "Cauliflower": "Cauliflower is one of several vegetables cultivated from the species Brassica oleracea in the genus Brassica, which is in the Brassicaceae (or mustard) family. An annual plant that reproduces by seed, the cauliflower head is composed of a (generally) white inflorescence meristem. Cauliflower heads resemble those in broccoli, which differs in having flower buds as the edible portion. Typically, only the head is eaten; the edible white flesh is sometimes called \"curd\".  The global production of cauliflower and broccoli in 2020 was over 25.5 million tons and worth 14.1 billion US dollars.[1] There are four major groups of cauliflower.[2] Cauliflowers are an \u2018arrested inflorescence\u2019\u00a0 subspecies of B. oleracea that arose around 2,500 years ago.[1] Genomic analysis finds initially evolved from broccoli with three MADS-box genes, playing roles in the formation of its curd. Nine loci and candidate genes are linked with morphological and biological characters.[1] There are hundreds of historic and current commercial varieties used around the world. A comprehensive list of about 80 North American varieties is maintained at North Carolina State University.[4] Cauliflower contains several non-nutrient phytochemicals common in the cabbage family that are under preliminary research for their potential properties, including isothiocyanates and glucosinolates.[8] Boiling reduces the levels of cauliflower glucosinolates, while other cooking methods, such as steaming, microwaving, and stir frying, have no significant effect on glucosinolate levels.[9] The word \"cauliflower\" derives from the Italian cavolfiore, meaning \"cabbage flower\".[10] The ultimate origin of the name is from the Latin words caulis (cabbage) and fl\u014ds (flower).[11] Cauliflower is the result of selective breeding and likely arose in the Mediterranean region, possibly from broccoli.[12] Pliny the Elder  included cyma among cultivated plants he described in Natural History: \"Ex omnibus brassicae generibus suavissima est cyma\"[13] (\"Of all the varieties of cabbage the most pleasant-tasted is cyma\").[14] Pliny's description likely refers to the flowering heads of an earlier cultivated variety of Brassica oleracea.[15] In the Middle Ages, early forms of cauliflower were associated with the island of Cyprus, with the 12th- and 13th-century Arab botanists Ibn al-'Awwam and Ibn al-Baitar claiming its origin to be Cyprus.[16][17] This association continued into Western Europe, where cauliflowers were sometimes known as Cyprus colewort, and there was extensive trade in western Europe in cauliflower seeds from Cyprus, under the French Lusignan rulers of the island, until well into the 16th century.[18] It is thought to have been introduced into Italy from Cyprus or the east coast of the Mediterranean around 1490, and then spread to other European countries in the following centuries.[12] Fran\u00e7ois Pierre La Varenne employed chouxfleurs in Le cuisinier fran\u00e7ois.[19] They were introduced to France from Genoa in the 16th century and are featured in Olivier de Serres' Th\u00e9\u00e2tre de l'agriculture (1600), as cauli-fiori \"as the Italians call it, which are still rather rare in France; they hold an honorable place in the garden because of their delicacy\",[20] but they did not commonly appear on grand tables until the time of Louis XIV.[21] It was introduced to India in 1822 by the British.[22] In 2020, global production of cauliflowers (combined for production reports with broccoli) was 25.5 million tonnes, led by China and India which, combined, had 72% of the world total.[23] Secondary producers, having 0.4\u20131.3 million tonnes annually, were the United States, Spain, Mexico, and Italy.[23] Cauliflower is relatively difficult to grow compared to cabbage, with common problems such as an underdeveloped head and poor curd quality.[24] Because the weather is a limiting factor for producing cauliflower, the plant grows best in moderate daytime temperatures 21\u201329\u00a0\u00b0C (70\u201385\u00a0\u00b0F), with plentiful sun and moist soil conditions high in organic matter and sandy soils.[5] The earliest maturity possible for cauliflower is 7 to 12 weeks from transplanting.[24] In the northern hemisphere, fall season plantings in July may enable harvesting before autumn frost.[5] Long periods of sun exposure in hot summer weather may cause cauliflower heads to discolor with a red-purple hue.[5] Transplantable cauliflowers can be produced in containers such as flats, hotbeds, or fields. In soil that is loose, well-drained, and fertile, field seedlings are shallow-planted 1\u00a0cm (1\u20442\u00a0in) and thinned by ample space \u2013 about 12 plants per 30\u00a0cm (1\u00a0ft).[5] Ideal growing temperatures are about 18\u00a0\u00b0C (65\u00a0\u00b0F) when seedlings are 25 to 35 days old.[5] Applications of fertilizer to developing seedlings begin when leaves appear, usually with a starter solution weekly. Transplanting to the field normally begins in late spring and may continue until mid-summer. Row spacing is about 38\u201346\u00a0cm (15\u201318\u00a0in). \nRapid vegetative growth after transplanting may benefit from such procedures as avoiding spring frosts, using starter solutions high in phosphorus, irrigating weekly, and applying fertilizer.[5] The most important disorders affecting cauliflower quality are a hollow stem, stunted head growth or buttoning, ricing, browning, and leaf-tip burn.[5] Among major pests affecting cauliflower are aphids, root maggots, cutworms, moths, and flea beetles.[24] The plant is susceptible to black rot, black leg, club root, black leaf spot, and downy mildew.[5] When cauliflower is mature, heads appear clear white, compact, and 15\u201320\u00a0cm (6\u20138\u00a0in) in diameter, and should be cooled shortly after harvest.[5] Forced air cooling to remove heat from the field during hot weather may be needed for optimal preservation. Short-term storage is possible using cool, high-humidity storage conditions.[5] Many species of blowflies, including Calliphora vomitoria, are known pollinators of cauliflower.[25] Cauliflower heads can be roasted, grilled, boiled, fried, steamed, pickled, or eaten raw. When cooking, the outer leaves and thick stalks are typically removed, leaving only the florets (the edible \"curd\" or \"head\"). The leaves are also edible but are often discarded.[26] Cauliflower can be used as a low-calorie, gluten-free alternative to rice and flour. Between 2012 and 2016, cauliflower production in the United States increased by 63%, and cauliflower-based product sales increased by 71% between 2017 and 2018. Cauliflower rice is made by pulsing cauliflower florets and cooking the result in oil.[27][28] Cauliflower pizza crust is made from cauliflower flour and is popular in pizza restaurants.[29] Mashed cauliflower is a low-carbohydrate alternative to mashed potatoes.[30] Raw cauliflower is 92% water, 5% carbohydrates, 2% protein, and contains negligible fat (see table). A 100-gram (3+1\u20442-ounce) reference amount of raw cauliflower provides 104 kilojoules (25 kilocalories) of food energy, and has a high content (20% or more of the Daily Value, DV) of vitamin C (58% DV) and moderate levels of several B vitamins and vitamin K (13\u201315% DV; table). Contents of dietary minerals are low (7% DV or less). Cauliflower has been noticed by mathematicians for its distinct fractal dimension,[33][34] calculated to be roughly 2.8.[35][36]\nOne of the fractal properties of cauliflower is that every branch, or \"module\", is similar to the entire cauliflower. Another quality, also present in other plant species, is that the angle between \"modules\", as they become more distant from the center, is 360 degrees divided by the golden ratio.[37] The fancied resemblance of the shape of a boxer's ear to a cauliflower gave rise to the term \"cauliflower ear\". ",
    "Chaat": " Chaat, or ch\u0101t (IAST:  c\u0101\u1e6d) (lit.\u2009'lick, tasting, delicacy') is a family of savoury snacks that originated in India, typically served as an hors d'oeuvre or at roadside tracks from stalls or food carts across South Asia in India, Pakistan, Nepal and Bangladesh.[1][2] With its origins in Uttar Pradesh, India,[3] chaat has become immensely popular in the rest of South Asia. The word derives from Hindi c\u0101\u1e6d \u091a\u093e\u091f (tasting, a delicacy), from c\u0101\u1e6dn\u0101 \u091a\u093e\u091f\u0928\u093e (to lick, as in licking one's fingers while eating), from Prakrit ca\u1e6d\u1e6dei \u091a\u091f\u094d\u091f\u0947\u0907 (to devour with relish, eat noisily).[4] The chaat variants are all based on fried dough, with various other ingredients. The original chaat is a mixture of potato pieces, crisp fried bread, dahi vada or dahi bhalla, gram or chickpeas and tangy-salty spices, with sour Indian chili and saunth (dried ginger and tamarind sauce), fresh green coriander leaves and yogurt for garnish, but other popular variants included alu tikkis or samosa (garnished with onion, potatoes, coriander, peas, hot spices and a dash of yogurt), bhel puri, dahi puri, panipuri, dahi vada, papri chaat, and sev puri. There are common elements among these variants including dahi (yogurt); chopped onions and coriander; sev (thin dried yellow salty noodles); and chaat masala, typically consisting of amchoor (dried mango powder), cumin, kala namak (Himalayan black rock salt), coriander, dried ginger, salt, black pepper, and red pepper. The ingredients are combined and served on a small metal plate or a banana leaf, dried and formed into a bowl. Some of the dishes now categorized as chaats, such as Dahi Vada, can be traced back to ancient periods. A recipe for a dahi vada analogue called kshiravata is mentioned in Manasollasa, a 12th-century Sanskrit encyclopedia compiled by Someshvara III, who ruled from present-day Karnataka.[5][6] According to food historian K.T Achaya, descriptions of dahi vada also appear in literature far earlier from 500\u00a0BC.[7] Another dish resembling as chaat as an organized phenomenon or distinct group of dishes, according to culinary anthropologist Kurush Dalal, originated in northern India (now Uttar Pradesh) in the late 17th century during the reign of Mughal Emperor Shah Jahan. The royal doctors had asked the people of Delhi to consume spicy and fried snacks, as well as dahi, as a countermeasure to the alkaline water of the Yamuna river that coursed through the city.[8] Most chaats originated in some parts of UP Uttar Pradesh in India later in 20th century,[9] but they are now eaten all across South Asia and neighboring countries. Some are results of cultural syncretism. Chaat is famous in South Asia in India, Pakistan, Nepal and Bangladesh.",
    "Chakli": "Chakli is a savoury snack from India. It is a spiral-shaped snack with a spiked surface.[1] Chakli is typically made from flours of rice, Bengal gram (brown chickpea) and black gram (urad daal). It has several variations, depending on the types and proportion of flours used. Murukku, a similar snack typically made without Bengal gram flour, is also sometimes called \"chakli\". Chakri is also a common nickname for \"Chakradhar,\" a name of Indian origin. It's especially made for Diwali.\nIt's also very popular in South Africa, introduced by the Indian diaspora. Maize flour is used instead of rice flour with the addition of salt and cumin as the basic dry ingredients. It is sold by street vendors and at neighborhood shops. Other names of the dish include  Kannada: \u0c9a\u0c95\u0ccd\u0c95\u0cc1\u0cb2\u0cbf chakkuli, Marathi: \u091a\u0915\u0932\u0940 chakali, Odiya: \u0b26\u0b3e\u0b28\u0b4d\u0b24\u0b15\u0b32\u0b3f Dantkali,  Gujarati: \u0a9a\u0a95\u0ab0\u0ac0 chakri, Telugu: \u0c1a\u0c15\u0c4d\u0c30\u0c3e\u0c32\u0c41 chakralu or jantikalu and Konkani: Chakri or Chakkuli. Murukku, a similar dish typically made without Bengal gram, is also sometimes called \"chakli\". Kadboli is a similar dish, which is shaped by hand instead of with an extruder. [2] In Indonesia, murukku and chakli variations are known as akar kelapa, and are particularly popular among Betawi.[3] The earliest mention of a dish similar to Chakli comes from ancient Ayurvedic texts where it is known as \"Saskuli\"; it was made from spiced rice flour dough with sesame seeds and then placed in a presser to form a long thread-like design and fried in ghee or oil. [4][5] The word Saskuli literally translates to \"ear-shaped\" design.[6][7] This early variation of rice flour-based chakli may have more closely resembled rice-murukku than the chakli known today.[8] The recipe that closely resembles modern Chakli finds mention in the medieval period cookbook Soopa Shastra dated to 1509 AD. This recipe was made from a blend of rice flour, Bengal gram flour and urad dal flour.[9] Chakli is made from the flours of rice, Bengal gram (chickpea) and black gram (urad dal). Other ingredients include coriander seed powder, cumin seed (jeera) powder, sesame seeds, red pepper powder, turmeric powder, salt, asafoetida powder and oil.[2] Some variations also include green gram (moong) and pigeon pea (tuar/arhar) instead of black gram.[10] The flours and seed powders are mixed, and boiling water is added to make a dough. The dough is kneaded and shaped into circular forms, using a mould. In commercial food processing units, usually a chakli extruder is used for shaping the dough.[2] The shaped dough is fried in hot oil until it becomes brown in colour. It is then removed from the oil, drained and cooled.[2]",

    "Chapati": " Chapati (alternatively spelled chapathi; pronounced as IAST: cap\u0101t\u012b, cap\u0101\u1e6d\u012b, c\u0101p\u0101\u1e6di), also known as roti, rooti, rotee, rotli,  rotta, safati, shabaati, phulka (in Marathi),  chapo (in East Africa), sada roti (in the Caribbean), poli, and roshi (in the Maldives),[1] is an unleavened flatbread originating from the Indian subcontinent and is a staple in India, Nepal, Bangladesh, Pakistan, Kyrgyzstan, Sri Lanka, the Arabian Peninsula, East Africa, and the Caribbean.[2] Chapatis are made of whole-wheat flour known as atta, mixed into dough with water, oil (optional), and salt (optional) in a mixing utensil called a parat, and are cooked on a tava (flat skillet).[3][4] It is a common staple in the Indian subcontinent as well as amongst expatriates from the Indian subcontinent throughout the world. Chapatis were also introduced to other parts of the world by immigrants from the Indian subcontinent, particularly by Indian merchants to Central Asia, Southeast Asia, East Africa, and the Caribbean.[5] The word chapati is derived from the Sanskrit word \u091a\u0930\u094d\u092a\u091f\u0940[6] (charpa\u1e6d\u012b). From a derivative of Sanskrit *\u091a\u0930\u094d\u092a (charpa, \u201cflat\u201d). Chapati is a form of roti or rotta (bread). The words are often used interchangeably. The word chapat (Marathi: \u091a\u093e\u092a\u091f) means \"slap\" or \"flat\", describing the traditional method of forming round pieces of thin dough by slapping the dough between the wetted palms of the hands. With each slap, the piece of dough is rotated. The word chapati is noted in the 16th-century document Ain-i-Akbari  by Abu'l-Fazl ibn Mubarak, vizier of Mughal Emperor Akbar.[2] Chapatis are one of the most common forms of wheat bread, a staple food in the Indian subcontinent. The carbonized wheat grains discovered at the excavations at Mohenjo-daro are of a similar variety to an endemic species of wheat still found in India. The Indus Valley is known to be one of the ancestral lands of cultivated wheat. Chapatis, along with rotis, were introduced to other parts of the world by immigrants from the Indian subcontinent, particularly by Indian merchants who settled in Southeast Asia and the Caribbean islands.[5] In 1857, the chapati likely may have played a role in the Indian mutiny Chapati Movement. Chapatis are made using a soft dough comprising wheat flour and water.[9] It is more finely ground than most Western-style whole wheat flours. Chapati dough is typically prepared with flour and water, kneaded with the knuckles of the hand made into a fist and left to rest for at least 10 or 15 minutes to an hour for the gluten in the dough to relax. After proofing, the dough becomes softer and more pliable. Small portions of the dough are pinched off and formed into round balls that are pressed between the two palms to form discs which are then dipped into flour and rolled out on a circular rolling board (a chakla), using a rolling pin known as a velan or belan, into a flat disc.[10] There are also automatic roti makers which automate the whole process.[11] The rolled-out dough is then thrown on the preheated dry tava and cooked on both sides. In some regions of the Indian subcontinent chapatis are only partially cooked on the skillet, and then cooked directly over a flame, which makes them puff up. The hot steam cooks the chapati rapidly from the inside. In some parts of northern India and eastern Pakistan, this is called a phulka. In southern parts of India, it is called a pulka. It is also possible to puff up the roti directly on the tava.[12] Once cooked, chapatis are often topped with butter or ghee.[13] In western regions of Maharashtra, some oil is added inside the rolled-out dough and then put on the tava; this is distinct from paratha. Chapati diameter and thickness vary from region to region. Chapatis made in domestic kitchens are usually not larger than 15 centimetres (6\u00a0in) to 18 centimetres (7\u00a0in) in diameter since the tava on which they are made comes in sizes that fit comfortably on a domestic stovetop. Tavas were traditionally made of unglazed earthenware, but are now typically made from metal. The shape of the rolling pin also varies from region to region. Some households simply use a kitchen worktop as a sort of pastry board, but round flat-topped \"boards\" made of wood, stone, or stainless steel are available specifically for rolling out chapatis.[5] In most parts of the Indian subcontinent, there is a distinction made between chapati and other related flatbreads eaten in the region like roti, paratha, kulcha, puri and naan based on cooking technique, texture and use of different types of flours. For example, parathas are either made layered by spreading them with ghee, folding and rolling out again into a disc which turns out flakey once cooked, or are filled with spinach, dal or cooked radish or potato. Parathas are mostly made using all-purpose flour instead of whole wheat flour.[14] There are many regional varieties of chapati in India: In the Maldives, chapatis are traditionally eaten for breakfast along with a dish known as mas huni.[15] Flatbreads are staples of Indian food. Chapatis go well with curries, dry sabzis or sabjis (vegetables cooked in gravy), chutneys or dal.[16]",
    "Chhena Poda": " Chhena poda (transl.\u2009Burnt cheese) is a cheese dessert from the Indian state of Odisha. Chhena poda literally means Baked Cheese in Odia.[1]\nIt is made of well-kneaded homemade fresh cheese chhena, sugar, semolina, and is baked for several hours until it browns.[2] Chhena poda is known as one of the Indian dessert whose flavor is predominantly derived from the caramelisation of sugar. Chhenapoda was invented by Sudarsan Sahu post 1947 after he set up a hotel in the village of Dashapalla and began experimenting with left over cottage cheese.[3] Chhenapoda Dibasa is being celebrated since 11 April 2022, the birth anniversary of Sudarsan Sahoo.[4][5][6] Chhena poda is usually made at home during traditional festivals in Odisha, such as Durga Puja.  Since the mid-1980s, it has gradually found its place in restaurant menus across Odisha. Odisha Milk Federation is investing heavily in mass-producing and popularising this delicacy, determined not to let this happen again.[7][8][9][10]",
    "Chhencheda": "  Odia cuisine is the cuisine of the Indian state of Odisha. Compared to other regional Indian cuisines, Odia cuisine uses less oil and is less spicy, while nonetheless remaining flavourful.[1] Rice is the staple food of this region. Mustard oil is used in some dishes as the cooking medium, but ghee (made of cow's milk) is preferred in temples. Odia foods traditionally served either on brass, bronze metal plates, banana leaf or disposable plates made of sal leaves.[2] Odia cooks, particularly from the Puri region, were much sought after due to their ability to cook food in accordance with Hindu scriptures. [3][4] Yoghurt is used in dishes. Many sweets of the region are based on chhena (cheese).[5] Rice is a major crop of Odisha along with wheat.[6] Lentils such as pigeon peas and moong beans are another major ingredients. Indigenous vegetables used in Odia cuisine are pumpkin, gourd, plantains, jackfruit, and papaya. Vegetables such as potatoes, cauliflowers, and cabbages are also used alongside local vegetables. Pancha phutana is a blend of five spices that is widely used in Odia cuisine. It contains mustard, cumin, fenugreek, aniseed and kalonji (onion seeds). Garlic, onion and ginger are used in most of the food. Turmeric and jaggery are used regularly.[7] The food in the region around Puri-Cuttack is greatly influenced by the Jagannath Temple. On the other hand, kalonji and mustard paste are used mostly in every part of the state. In the region closer to Andhra Pradesh, curry tree leaves and tamarind are used more. The Brahmapur region has influences of South Indian cuisine.[8] Temples in the region make offerings to the presiding deities. The prasada of the Jagannath Temple is well known, and is specifically called Maha Prasad meaning greatest of all prasadas. It consists of 56 recipes, so it is called chhapan bhoga. It is based on the legend that Krishna missed his eight meals for seven days, while trying to save a village from a storm holding up the Govardhan hill, as a shelter.[5] Fish and other seafood are eaten mainly in coastal areas. Several curries are prepared from crab, prawn and lobster with spices.[7][9] Freshwater fish is available from rivers and irrigation canals.[3] Khatta refers to a type of sour side dish or chutney usually served with Odia thalis.[21] A list of the plants that are used as s\u0101ga is as below. They are prepared by adding pancha phutan, with or without onion/garlic, and are best enjoyed with pakhala. Pithas and sweets are types of traditional Odia dishes.[27][28] Smoked Dry sardine after cleaning mix with garlic, green chilly, salt using mortar and pestle or mixture grinder. Dry White bait fish (\u0b1a\u0b3e\u0b09\u0b33\u0b3f \u0b36\u0b41\u0b16\u0b41\u0b06), dry shrimp (\u0b1a\u0b3f\u0b19\u0b4d\u0b17\u0b41\u0b21\u0b3c\u0b3f \u0b36\u0b41\u0b16\u0b41\u0b06, \u0b24\u0b3e\u0b02\u0b2a\u0b47\u0b21\u0b3e) etc. also prepared like this flake/powdered. There are many traditional alcoholic and non-alcoholic drinks which are unique to Odisha. Some are made during specific festivals or as an offering to Hindu gods, and others are made all year. The drinks which have a thick consistency are usually called pa\u1e47an and the ones with have a watery consistency are usually known as sarbat.[39][40][41] Many of the ethnic tribes[42] of Odisha have their own indigenous drinks made from forest produce. Any drink that contains alcohol is usually called madya[43][44]",
    "Chicken": " Gallus domesticus L. The chicken (Gallus domesticus) is a large and round short-winged bird, domesticated from the red junglefowl of Southeast Asia around 8,000 years ago. Most chickens are raised for food, providing meat and eggs; others are kept as pets or for cockfighting. Chickens are common and widespread domestic animals, with a total population of 26.5 billion as of 2023[update], and an annual production of more than 50 billion birds. A hen bred for laying can produce over 300 eggs per year. There are numerous cultural references to chickens in folklore, religion, and literature. Terms for chickens include: Chicken can mean a chick, as in William Shakespeare's play Macbeth, where Macduff laments the death of \"all my pretty chickens and their dam\".[15] The usage is preserved in placenames such as the Hen and Chicken Islands.[16] In older sources, and still often in trade and scientific contexts, chickens as a species are described as common fowl or domestic fowl.[17] Chickens are relatively large birds, active by day. The body is round, the legs are unfeathered in most breeds, and the wings are short.[18] Wild junglefowl can fly; chickens and their flight muscles are too heavy to allow them to fly more than a short distance.[19] Size and coloration vary widely between breeds.[18] Adult chickens of both sexes have a fleshy crest on their heads called a comb or cockscomb, and hanging flaps of skin on either side under their beaks called wattles; combs and wattles are more prominent in males. Some breeds have a mutation that causes extra feathering under the face, giving the appearance of a beard.[20] Chickens are omnivores.[21] In the wild, they scratch at the soil to search for seeds, insects, and animals as large as lizards, small snakes,[22] and young mice.[23] A chicken may live for 5\u201310 years, depending on the breed.[24] The world's oldest known chicken lived for 16 years.[25] Chickens are gregarious, living in flocks, and incubate eggs and raise young communally. Individual chickens dominate others, establishing a pecking order; dominant individuals take priority for access to food and nest sites. The concept of dominance, involving pecking, was described in female chickens by Thorleif Schjelderup-Ebbe in 1921 as the \"pecking order\".[26][27] Male chickens tend to leap and use their claws in conflicts.[28] Chickens are capable of mobbing and killing a weak or inexperienced predator, such as a young fox.[29] A male's crowing is a loud and sometimes shrill call, serving as a territorial signal to other males,[30] and in response to sudden disturbances within their surroundings. Hens cluck loudly after laying an egg and to call their chicks. Chickens give different warning calls to indicate that a predator is approaching from the air or on the ground.[31] To initiate courting, some roosters may dance in a circle around or near a hen (a circle dance), often lowering the wing which is closest to the hen.[32] The dance triggers a response in the hen[32] and when she responds to his call, the rooster may mount the hen and proceed with the mating. Mating typically involves a sequence in which the male approaches the female and performs a waltzing display. If the female is unreceptive, she runs off; otherwise, she crouches, and the male mounts, treading with both feet on her back. After copulation the male does a tail-bending display.[33] Sperm transfer occurs by cloacal contact between the male and female, in an action called the 'cloacal kiss'.[34] As with all birds, reproduction is controlled by a neuroendocrine system, the Gonadotropin-Releasing Hormone-I neurons in the hypothalamus. Reproductive hormones including estrogen, progesterone, and gonadotropins (luteinizing hormone and follicle-stimulating hormone) initiate and maintain sexual maturation changes. Reproduction declines with age, thought to be due to a decline in GnRH-I-N.[35] Hens often try to lay in nests that already contain eggs and sometimes move eggs from neighbouring nests into their own. A flock thus uses only a few preferred locations, rather than having a different nest for every bird.[36] Under natural conditions, most birds lay only until a clutch is complete; they then incubate all the eggs. This is called \"going broody\". The hen sits on the nest, fluffing up or pecking defensively if disturbed. She rarely leaves the nest until the eggs have hatched.[37] Eggs of chickens from the high-altitude region of Tibet have special physiological adaptations that result in a higher hatching rate in low oxygen environments. When eggs are placed in a hypoxic environment, chicken embryos from these populations express much more hemoglobin than embryos from other chicken populations. This hemoglobin has a greater affinity for oxygen, binding oxygen more readily.[38] Fertile chicken eggs hatch at the end of the incubation period, about 21 days; the chick uses its egg tooth to break out of the shell.[32] Hens remain on the nest for about two days after the first chick hatches; during this time the newly hatched chicks feed by absorbing the internal yolk sac.[39] The hen guards her chicks and broods them to keep them warm. She leads them to food and water and calls them towards food. The chicks imprint on the hen and subsequently follow her continually. She continues to care for them until they are several weeks old.[40] Inbreeding of White Leghorn chickens tends to cause inbreeding depression expressed as reduced egg number and delayed sexual maturity.[41] Strongly inbred Langshan chickens display obvious inbreeding depression in reproduction, particularly for traits such as age when the first egg is laid and egg number.[42] Water or ground-dwelling fowl similar to modern partridges, in the Galliformes, the order of bird that chickens belong to, survived the Cretaceous\u2013Paleogene extinction event that killed all tree-dwelling birds and their dinosaur relatives.[43] Chickens are descended primarily from the red junglefowl (Gallus gallus) and are scientifically classified as the same species.[44] Domesticated chickens freely interbreed with populations of red junglefowl.[44] The domestic chicken has subsequently hybridised with grey junglefowl, Sri Lankan junglefowl and green junglefowl;[45] a gene for yellow skin, for instance, was incorporated into domestic birds from the grey junglefowl (G. sonneratii).[46] It is estimated that chickens share between 71 and 79% of their genome with red junglefowl.[45] According to one early study, a single domestication event of the red junglefowl in present-day Thailand gave rise to the modern chicken with minor transitions separating the modern breeds.[49] The red junglefowl is well adapted to take advantage of the vast quantities of seed produced during the end of the multi-decade bamboo seeding cycle, to boost its own reproduction.[50] In domesticating the chicken, humans took advantage of the red junglefowl's ability to reproduce prolifically when exposed to a surge in its food supply.[51] Exactly when and where the chicken was domesticated remains controversial. Genomic studies estimate that the chicken was domesticated 8,000 years ago[45] in Southeast Asia and spread to China and India 2,000 to 3,000 years later. Archaeological evidence supports domestic chickens in Southeast Asia well before 6000\u00a0BC, China by 6000\u00a0BC and India by 2000\u00a0BC.[45][52][53] A landmark 2020 Nature study that fully sequenced 863 chickens across the world suggests that all domestic chickens originate from a single domestication event of red junglefowl whose present-day distribution is predominantly in southwestern China, northern Thailand and Myanmar. These domesticated chickens spread across Southeast and South Asia where they interbred with local wild species of junglefowl, forming genetically and geographically distinct groups. Analysis of the most popular commercial breed shows that the White Leghorn breed possesses a mosaic of divergent ancestries inherited from subspecies of red junglefowl.[54][55][56] A word for the domestic chicken (*manuk) is part of the reconstructed Proto-Austronesian language, indicating they were domesticated by the Austronesian peoples since ancient times. Chickens, together with dogs and pigs, were carried throughout the entire range of the prehistoric Austronesian maritime migrations to Island Southeast Asia, Micronesia, Island Melanesia, Polynesia, and Madagascar, starting from at least 3000\u00a0BC from Taiwan.[57][58][59][60] These chickens might have been introduced during pre-Columbian times to South America via Polynesian seafarers, but evidence for this is still putative.[61] The possibility that domestic chickens were in the Americas before Western contact is debated by researchers, but blue-egged chickens, found only in the Americas and Asia, suggest an Asian origin for early American chickens. A lack of data from Thailand, Russia, the Indian subcontinent, Southeast Asia and Sub-Saharan Africa makes it difficult to lay out a clear map of the spread of chickens in these areas; better description and genetic analysis of local breeds threatened by extinction may also help with research into this area.[62] Chicken bones from the Arauco Peninsula in south-central Chile were radiocarbon dated as pre-Columbian, and DNA analysis suggested they were related to prehistoric populations in Polynesia.[47][48] However, further study of the same bones cast doubt on the findings.[63][64] Chicken remains have been difficult to date, given the small and fragile bird bones; this may account for discrepancies in dates given by different sources. Archaeological evidence is supplemented by mentions in historical texts from the last few centuries BC, and by depictions in prehistoric artworks, such as across Central Asia.[65] Chickens were widespread throughout southern Central Asia by the 4th century BC.[65] Middle Eastern chicken remains go back to a little earlier than 2000\u00a0BC in Syria.[62] Phoenicians spread chickens along the Mediterranean coasts as far as Iberia. During the Hellenistic period (4th\u20132nd centuries BC), in the southern Levant, chickens began to be widely domesticated for food.[66] The first pictures of chickens in Europe are found on Corinthian pottery of the 7th century BC.[67][68] Breeding increased under the Roman Empire and reduced in the Middle Ages.[62] Genetic sequencing of chicken bones from archaeological sites in Europe revealed that in the High Middle Ages chickens became less aggressive and began to lay eggs earlier in the breeding season.[69] Chickens reached Egypt via the Middle East for purposes of cockfighting about 1400\u00a0BC and became widely bred in Egypt around 300\u00a0BC.[62] Three possible routes of introduction into Africa around the early first millennium AD could have been through the Egyptian Nile Valley, the East Africa Roman-Greek or Indian trade, or from Carthage and the Berbers, across the Sahara. The earliest known remains are from Mali, Nubia, East Coast, and South Africa and date back to the middle of the first millennium AD.[62] Chickens are susceptible both to parasites such as mites, and to diseases caused by pathogens such as bacteria and viruses. The parasite Dermanyssus gallinae feeds on blood, causing irritation and reducing egg production, and acts as a vector for bacterial diseases such as salmonellosis and spirochaetosis.[70]\nViral diseases include avian influenza.[71] Chickens are common and widespread domestic animals, with a total population of 23.7 billion as of 2018[update].[72] More than 50 billion chickens are reared annually as a source of meat and eggs.[73] In the United States alone, more than 8 billion chickens are slaughtered each year for meat,[74] and more than 300 million chickens are reared for egg production.[75] The vast majority of poultry is raised in factory farms. According to the Worldwatch Institute, 74% of the world's poultry meat and 68% of eggs are produced this way.[76] An alternative to intensive poultry farming is free-range farming. Friction between these two main methods has led to long-term issues of ethical consumerism. Opponents of intensive farming argue that it harms the environment, creates human health risks and is inhumane towards sentient animals.[77] Advocates of intensive farming say that their efficient systems save land and food resources owing to increased productivity, and that the animals are looked after in a controlled environment.[78] Chickens farmed for meat are called broilers. Broiler breeds typically take less than six weeks to reach slaughter size,[79] some weeks longer for free range and organic broilers.[80] Chickens farmed primarily for eggs are called layer hens. The UK alone consumes more than 34 million eggs per day.[81] Hens of some breeds can produce over 300 eggs per year; the highest authenticated rate of egg laying is 371 eggs in 364 days.[82] After 12 months of laying, the commercial hen's egg-laying ability declines to the point where the flock is commercially unviable. Hens, particularly from battery cage systems, are sometimes infirm or have lost a significant amount of their feathers, and their life expectancy has been reduced from around seven years to less than two years.[83] In the UK and Europe, laying hens are then slaughtered and used in processed foods, or sold as 'soup hens'.[83] In some other countries, flocks are sometimes force moulted rather than being slaughtered to re-invigorate egg-laying. This involves complete withdrawal of food (and sometimes water) for 7\u201314 days[84] or sufficiently long to cause a body weight loss of 25 to 35%,[85] or up to 28 days under experimental conditions.[86] This stimulates the hen to lose her feathers but also re-invigorates egg-production. Some flocks may be force-moulted several times. In 2003, more than 75% of all flocks were moulted in the US.[87] Keeping chickens as pets became increasingly popular in the 2000s[88] among urban and suburban residents.[89] Many people obtain chickens for their egg production but often name them and treat them as any other pet like cats or dogs. Chickens provide companionship and have individual personalities. While many do not cuddle much, they will eat from one's hand, jump onto one's lap, respond to and follow their handlers, as well as show affection.[90][91] Chickens are social, inquisitive, intelligent[92] birds, and many people find their behaviour entertaining.[93] Certain breeds, such as silkies and many bantam varieties, are generally docile and are often recommended as good pets around children with disabilities.[94] A cockfight is a contest held in a ring called a cockpit between two cocks. Cockfighting is outlawed in many countries as involving cruelty to animals.[95] The activity seems to have been practised in the Indus Valley civilisation from 2500 to 2100 BC.[96] In the process of domestication, chickens were apparently kept initially for cockfighting, and only later used for food.[97] Chickens have long been used as model organisms to study developing embryos. Large numbers of embryos can be provided commercially; fertilized eggs can easily be opened and used to observe the developing embryo. Equally important, embryologists can carry out experiments on such embryos, close the egg again and study the effects later in development. For instance, many important discoveries in limb development have been made using chicken embryos, such as the discovery of the apical ectodermal ridge and the zone of polarizing activity.[98] The chicken was the first bird species to have its genome sequenced.[99] At 1.21 Gb, the chicken genome is similarly sized compared to other birds, but smaller than nearly all mammals: the human genome is 3.2 Gb.[100] The final gene set contained 26,640 genes (including noncoding genes and pseudogenes), with a total of 19,119 protein-coding genes, a similar number to the human genome.[101] In 2006, scientists researching the ancestry of birds switched on a chicken recessive gene, talpid2, and found that the embryo jaws initiated formation of teeth, like those found in ancient bird fossils.[102]  Chickens are featured widely in folklore, religion, literature, and popular culture. The chicken is a sacred animal in many cultures and deeply embedded in belief systems and religious practices.[103]\nRoosters are sometimes used for divination, a practice called alectryomancy. This involves the sacrifice of a sacred rooster, often during a ritual cockfight, used as a form of communication with the gods.[104] In Gabriel Garc\u00eda M\u00e1rquez's Nobel-Prize-winning 1967 novel One Hundred Years Of Solitude, cockfighting is outlawed in the town of Macondo after the patriarch of the Buendia family murders his cockfighting rival and is haunted by the man's ghost.[105] Chicken jokes have been made at least since The Knickerbocker published one in 1847.[106] Chickens have been featured in art in farmyard scenes such as Adriaen van Utrecht's 1646 Turkeys and Chickens and Walter Osborne's 1885 Feeding the Chickens.[107] The nursery rhyme \"Cock a doodle doo\", its chorus line imitating the cockerel's call, was published in Mother Goose's Melody in 1765.[108] \nThe 2000 animated adventure comedy film Chicken Run, directed by Peter Lord and Nick Park, featured anthropomorphic chickens with many chicken jokes.[109][110][111]",
    "Chicken Balls": "Chicken balls are a food consisting of small, spherical or nearly spherical pieces of chicken. They are prepared and eaten in several different cuisines. Chicken balls (Chinese: \u9e21\u7403; pinyin: j\u012b qi\u00fa) are a type of modern Chinese food served in Canada,[1][2][3] the United States, and the United Kingdom[4] as a staple of Chinese take-out. The dish consists of small chunks of fried chicken breast meat covered in a crispy batter coating. They are often served with curry sauce, sweet and sour sauce or plum sauce. These are largely unheard of in China, depending on the recipe and referred name.[5][failed verification] Another kind of chicken balls, which are similar to southern Chinese fish balls, may be found in countries in East and Southeast Asia, such as the Philippines[6] and Japan (tsukune).[7] Chicken balls are also a part of several other culinary traditions, including Italian Jewish cuisine[8] and Islamic cuisine.[9][10]",
    "Chicken Biryani": "This is an accepted version of this page   Biryani (/b\u025c\u02d0r\u02c8j\u0251\u02d0ni/) is a mixed rice dish, mainly popular in South Asia. It is made with rice, some type of meat (chicken, goat, lamb, beef, prawn, or fish) and spices. To cater to vegetarians, in some cases, it is prepared by substituting vegetables or paneer for the meat.[1] Sometimes eggs or potatoes are also added.[2] Biryani is one of the most popular dishes in South Asia and among the South Asian diaspora, although the dish is often associated with the region's Muslim population in particular.[3] Similar dishes are also prepared in other parts of the world such as in  Iran, Iraq, Myanmar, Thailand, and Malaysia.[4] Biryani is the single most-ordered dish on Indian online food ordering and delivery services, and has been labelled as the most popular dish overall in India.[3][5] One theory states that it originated from birinj (Persian: \u0628\u0631\u0646\u062c), the Persian word for rice.[6][7] Another theory states that it is derived from biryan or beriyan (Persian: \u0628\u0631\u06cc\u0627\u0646), which means \"to fry\" or \"to roast\".[8][9] It may alternatively be related to the Persian word bereshtan (Persian: \u0628\u0631\u0634\u062a\u0646) which also means \"to roast (onions)\", as the dish is often prepared by flavouring rice with fried onions and meat, besides mild spices. The exact origin of the dish is uncertain, however, it is speculated to have originated in Persia, (now Iran) or South Asia. In North India, different varieties of biryani developed.[6][10] According to the historian Lizzie Collingham, the modern biryani developed in the royal kitchens of the Mughal Empire (1526\u20131857) and is a mix of the native spicy rice dishes of South Asia and the Persian polao.[11] Indian restaurateur Kris Dhillon believes that the dish originated in Persia and was brought to South Asia by the Mughals.[12] Salma Hossein, whom the BBC regards as the \"doyenne of Islamic cooking in India\", shares a similar view, asserting that biryani came to South Asia from Persia even before the Mughal era. Food scholar Pushpesh Pant also challenges the Mughal-origin claim, stating that it originated in Iran and that \"there is no evidence that biryani first came to this land with the Mughals. It is far more probable that it travelled with pilgrims and soldier-statesmen of noble descent to the Deccan region in South India\".[13] Another theory claims that the dish was prepared in South Asia before the first Mughal emperor Babur conquered India.[14] The 16th-century Mughal text Ain-i-Akbari makes no distinction between biryanis and pilaf (or pulao): it states that the word \"biryani\" is of older usage in India.[citation needed][15] A similar theory, that biryani came to India with Timur's invasion, appears to be incorrect because there is no record of biryani having existed in his native land during that period.[14] According to Pratibha Karan, who wrote the book Biryani, biryani is of Mughal origin, derived from pilaf varieties brought to the South Asian subcontinent by Arab and Persian traders. She speculates that the pulao was an army dish in medieval India. Armies would prepare a one-pot dish of rice with any available red meat. Over time, the dish became biryani due to different methods of cooking, with the distinction between \"pulao\" and \"biryani\" being arbitrary.[6][14] According to Vishwanath Shenoy, the owner of a biryani restaurant chain in India, one branch of biryani comes from the Mughals, while another was brought by the Arab traders to Malabar in South India.[16] There are various apocryphal stories dating the invention to Shah Jahan's time but Rana Safvi, the distinguished historian, says she could only find a recipe from the later Mughal period, from Bahadur Shah Zafar's time. It is not her claim that there was no biryani before that; just that she has not found a recipe. Other historians who have gone through texts say that the first references to biryani only appear around the 18th century.[17] Some claim that the dish \"oonchoru\" as mentioned in Sangam literature, which dates from between 200 BCE and 200 CE, is a predecessor of modern biryani. This dish, which was served to the soldiers of the Chera kings in Kerala, was said to be made of rice, ghee, meat, turmeric, coriander, pepper, and bay leaf.[18][19][20] The spices used in the preparation of South Indian biryanis, such as those used in the Malabar variety, are distinctive to the region and the Western Ghats. These spices are not found in the Middle East, Persia, or North India, underscoring the unique culinary heritage and local ingredients of South Indian biryani.[18][19][20] In South India, where rice is more widely used as a staple food, several distinct varieties of biryani emerged from Hyderabad in Telangana, Vijayawada in Andhra Pradesh, Mangalore and Bhatkal in Coastal Karnataka, Thalassery and Kozhikode in Malabar Kerala, as well as Ambur and Chettinad in Tamil Nadu.[6][10] Pilaf or pulao, as it is known on the Indian subcontinent, is another mixed rice dish popular in the cuisines of the Indian subcontinent, Central Asia, and Middle Eastern cuisine. Opinions differ on the differences between pulao and biryani, and whether actually there is a difference between the two.[21] According to Delhi-based historian Sohail Hashmi, pulao tends to be plainer than biryani, and consists of meat or vegetables cooked with rice with the bottom layered with potatoes or onions. Biryani contains more gravy (or yakhni), and is often cooked longer, leaving the meat (and vegetables, if present) more tender, and the rice more flavoured. Biryani is also cooked with additional dressings and often would have a light layer of scorched rice at the bottom.[22] Author Pratibha Karan states that while the terms are often applied arbitrarily, the main distinction is that a biryani consists of two layers of rice with a layer of meat (and vegetables, if present) in the middle, while the pulao is not layered.[14] Author Colleen Taylor Sen lists the following distinctions between biryani and pulao:[23] Ingredients for biryani vary according to the region and the type of meat and vegetables used. Meat (chicken, goat, beef, lamb,[26] prawn or fish) is the prime ingredient with rice. As is common in dishes of South Asia, vegetables are sometimes also used when preparing biryani. Corn may be used, depending on the season and availability. Navratan biryani tends to use sweeter, richer ingredients such as cashews, sultanas (kishmish), and fruits such as apples and pineapples.[22] The spices and condiments used in biryani may include fennel seeds, ghee (clarified butter), nutmeg, mace,[27] pepper, cloves,[27] cardamom, cinnamon, bay leaves, coriander, mint, ginger, onions, tomatoes, green chilies,[26] star anise, and garlic. The premium varieties include saffron.[27] Some commercial recipes for Biryani also include aromatic essences such as Mitha Ittar see attar, kewra and rose water. Dried sour prunes (Alu Bukhara) may also be added to the biryani. In nasi briyani and other variants made in Southeast Asian countries such as Malaysia, Singapore, and Indonesia, typical Southeast Asian spices and aromatics such as pandan leaf may be used alongside typical South Asian spices.[28] The main ingredient that usually accompanies the spices is chicken, lamb or goat meat; special varieties might use beef or seafood instead. The dish may be served with dahi chutney or raita, seekh kebab, Qorma, curry, a sour dish of aubergine (brinjal), boiled egg, and salad. Biryani can be cooked using one of two styles/techniques, pakki (\"cooked\") and kacchi (\"raw\").[29] There are many types of biryani, whose names are often based on their region of origin. For example, Sindhi biryani developed in the Sindh region of what is now Pakistan, and Hyderabadi biryani developed in the city of Hyderabad in South India. Some have taken the name of the shop that sells it, for example: Haji Biriyani, Haji Nanna Biriyani in Old Dhaka,[30] Fakhruddin Biriyani in Dhaka,[31][32] Students biryani in Karachi, Lucky biryani in Bandra, Mumbai and Baghdadi biryani in Colaba, Mumbai.[22] Biryanis are often specific to the Muslim communities where they originate; they are usually the defining dishes of those communities.[33] Ambur/Vaniyambadi biryani is a variety cooked in the neighboring towns of Ambur and Vaniyambadi in the Tirupattur district of the northeastern part of Tamil Nadu, which has a high Muslim population. It was introduced during the Nawabs of Arcot who once ruled the area. It is typically made with jeera samba rice.[34] Nowadays, it is popular as Ambur or Vaniyambadi style biryani as those are two prominent towns along the popular Bangalore to Chennai highway where travellers stop for eating.[35] The Ambur/Vaniyambadi biryani is accompanied by dhalcha, a sour brinjal curry, and pachadi or raitha (sliced onions mixed with plain yogurt, tomato, chilies, and salt). It has a distinctive aroma and is considered light on the stomach.[citation needed] The usage of spice is moderate, and curd is used as a gravy base. It also has a higher ratio of meat to rice.[15] Ambur-style biriyani is popular as street food all across South India. This is an integral part of the Navayath cuisine and a specialty of Bhatkal, a coastal town in Karnataka. Its origins are traced to the Persian traders who introduced biryani along with kababs and Indian breads. In Bhatkali biryani, the meat is cooked in an onion and green chili-based masala and layered with fragrant rice. It has a unique spicy and heady flavour, and the rice is overwhelmingly white with mild streaks of orange. Its variations include beef, goat, chicken, titar (Partridge), egg, fish, crab, prawn, and vegetable biryani. Though similar to those in Thalassery, this biryani differs with lingering after-notes of mashed onions laced with garlic[citation needed]. A few chilies and spices littered with curry leaves lends a unique flavour to Bhatkal biryani. No oil is used.[36] Bohri biryani, prepared by the Bohris is flavoured with lots of tomatoes.[16] It is popular in Karachi. Chettinad biryani is famous in the Indian state of Tamil Nadu. It is made of jeeraka samba rice, and smells of spices and ghee. It is best taken with nenju elumbu kuzhambu, a spicy and tangy goat meat gravy [citation needed]. The podi kozhi is usually topped with fried onions and curry leaves.[37][38][39][40] Degh ki biryani is a typical biryani made from small cubes of beef or mutton. This biryani originated in Ahmadnagar Sultanate and is famous in Parbhani in Marathwada region and generally served at weddings. The meat is flavoured with ginger, garlic, red chili, cumin, garam masala, fried onion and curd. This biryani is also known as kachay gosht ki biryani or dum biryani, where the meat is marinated and cooked along with short-grained and fine rice. It is left on a slow fire or dum for a fragrant and aromatic flavour. The Delhi version of biryani developed a unique local flavour as the Mughal kings shifted their political capital to the North Indian city of Delhi. Until the 1950s, most people cooked biryani in their home and rarely ate at eateries outside of their homes. Hence, restaurants primarily catered to travellers and merchants. Any region that saw more of these two classes of people nurtured more restaurants, and thus their own versions of biryani. This is the reason why most shops that sold biryani in Delhi, tended to be near mosques such as Jama Masjid (for travellers) or traditional shopping districts (such as Chandni Chowk).[citation needed] Each part of Delhi has its own style of biryani, often based on its original purpose, thus giving rise to Nizamuddin biryani, Shahjahanabad biryani, etc.[citation needed]  Nizamuddin biryani usually had little expensive meat and spices as it was primarily meant to be made in bulk for offering at the Nizamuddin Dargah shrine and thereafter to be distributed to devotees.[22] A non-dum biryani, using many green chillies, popularized by the Babu Shahi Bawarchi shops located outside the National Sports Club in Delhi is informally called Babu Shahi biryani. Another version of Delhi biryani uses achaar (pickles) and is called achaari biryani.[41] The city of Dhaka in Bangladesh used to be the capital of Bengal Subah and is known for Dhakaiya Kacchi Biryani, a Chevon Biryani made with highly seasoned rice and goat meat. The recipe includes: highly seasoned rice, goat meat, mustard oil, garlic, onion, black pepper, saffron, clove, cardamom, cinnamon, salt, lemon, doi, peanuts, cream, raisins and a small amount of cheese (either from cows or buffalo). It is accompanied by borhani, a salted mint drink made of yogurt, coriander, mint and salt. Haji biryani is a favourite among Bangladeshis living abroad.[42] A recipe was handed down by the founder of one Dhaka restaurant to the next generation. Haji Mohammad Shahed claimed, \"I have never changed anything, not even the amount of salt\".[43] Bengali style biryani often includes potatoes. The city of Dindigul in Tamil Nadu is noted for its biryani, which uses a little curd and lemon juice for a tangy taste.[44] Military hotels of Bangalore in Karnataka are known for selling Biryani served in dried leaf bowl called Donne.[45] It is typically made from jeera samba rice, yogurt with lot of common mint and coriander leaves.[46][47] Hyderabadi biryani is India's most famous biryani; some say biryani is synonymous with Hyderabad.[48] Hyderabadi biryani developed in Hyderabad Subah under the rule of Asaf Jah I, who was first appointed as the governor of Deccan by the Mughal Emperor Aurangzeb. It is made with basmati rice, spices and goat meat. Popular variations use chicken instead of goat meat. There are various forms of Hyderabadi biryani, such as kachay gosht ki biryani or dum biryani, where goat meat is marinated and cooked along with the rice. It is left on a slow fire or dum for a fragrant and aromatic flavour.[49] Memoni biryani is an extremely spicy variety developed by the Memons of Gujarat-Sindh region in India and Pakistan.[16] It is made with mutton, dahi, fried onions, and potatoes, and fewer tomatoes compared to Sindhi biryani. Kalyani biryani is a beef biryani from the former state of Hyderabad Deccan.[50] Also known as the \"poor man's\"  Hyderabadi biryani, Kalyani biryani is made from small cubes of buffalo meat or cow meat.[51][52] The meat is flavoured with ginger, garlic, turmeric, red chili, cumin, coriander powder, and lots of onion and tomato. It is first cooked as a thick curry and then cooked along with rice. Then given dum (the Indian method of steaming in a covered pot). It has a distinct tomato, jeera and dhania flavour.[53] Kalyani biryani is supposed to have originated in Bidar during the reign of the Kalyani Nawabs, who migrated to Hyderabad in mid 18th century after one of the Nawabs, Ghazanfur Jang married into the Asaf Jahi family uniting their realms.[citation needed] Kalyani biryani was served by the Kalyani Nawabs to all of their subjects who came from Bidar to Hyderabad and stayed or visited their devdi or noble mansion. Calcutta or Kolkata biryani evolved from Dhakaiya biryani and the Lucknow style biryani when Awadh's last Nawab, Wajid Ali Shah, was exiled in 1856 to the Kolkata suburb of Metiabruz. Shah brought his personal chef with him. Like Dhakaiya biryani, the Kolkata biriyani is characterized by the presence of potato in it.[16] Lucknow was a capital of Awadh Subah. For Lucknow/ avadhi biryani, basmati rice is cooked in ghee with warm, aromatic spices and then layered with a type of meat curry or marinade, sealed, and cooked over low heat until done.[54][55] A specialty of the Beary Muslim community in coastal Karnataka and is also known as Manglorean-style biryani. The dish is made using lots of green chilly and coconut and has the subtle flavor and aroma of fennel. Spices that include nutmeg, mint leaves, fennel seeds, mace (javitri), poppy seeds, almonds, star anise and others. The rice and meat (mutton, chicken, beef) are cooked separately and then layered and slowly cooked together again. This dish is highly served during marriages and other homely occasions. This type of biryani is popular in the Palakkad and Coimbatore regions. This was most commonly prepared by Rowther families in Kerala and Tamil Nadu. This type of biryani is cooked in a different style. Goat meat is most commonly used and it is entirely different from Malabar biryani.[citation needed] The exotic and aromatic Sindhi biryani, originating in the former Mughal subah based in Thatta is known in Pakistan for its spicy taste, fragrant rice, and delicate meat. Sindhi biryani is a beloved staple in food menus of Pakistani and Sindhi cuisine. Sindhi biryani is prepared with meat and a mixture of basmati rice, vegetables, and various spices. Biryani was introduced in the 1900s to Sri Lanka by the Indian Muslims who engaged in trade within the country.[citation needed]  In many cases, Sri Lankan biryani is spicier than most Indian varieties. Side dishes may include Malay pickle, Cashew curry and Mint sambol.[citation needed] Thalassery biryani is the variation of biryani found in the Indian state of Kerala. It is one of the many dishes of the Kerala Muslim community, and very popular.[56] The ingredients are chicken, spices and the specialty is the choice of rice called khyma. Khyma rice is generally mixed with ghee. Although a large number of spices such as mace, cashew nuts, sultana raisins, fennel-cumin seeds, tomato, onion, ginger, garlic, shallot, cloves and cinnamon are used,[57] there is only a small amount of chili (or chili powder) used in its preparation. A pakki biryani, the Thalassery biryani uses a small-grained thin (not round) fragrant variety of rice known as khyma or jeerakasala. The dum method of preparation (sealing the lid with dough [maida] or cloth and placing red-hot charcoal above the lid) is applied here to avoid scorched rice. In Kerala, another variety called beef biryani is well known.[58] In Myanmar (Burma), biryani is known in Burmese as danpauk or danbauk (\u1012\u1036\u1015\u1031\u102b\u1000\u103a), derived from the Persian term dum pukht, which refers to a slow oven cooking technique. Danbauk is a mainstay at festive events such as Thingyan, weddings and donation feasts.[59][60] Given danbauk's South Asian origins, danbauk restaurants and chains have traditionally been owned by Muslims, but in recent decades Buddhist entrepreneurs have entered the market.[59] Featured ingredients include: cashew nuts, yogurt, raisins and peas, chicken, cloves, cinnamon, saffron and bay leaf cooked in long-grain rice.[61] In danbauk, chicken specially seasoned with a danbauk masala spice mix,[62] is cooked with the rice.[63] Danbauk is typically eaten with a number of side dishes, including a fresh salad of sliced onions, julienned cabbage, sliced cucumbers, fermented limes and lemons, fried dried chilies, and soup.[64] In recent decades, danbauk restaurants have innovated variations, including \"ambrosia\" biryani (\u1014\u1010\u103a\u101e\u102f\u1013\u102c\u1011\u1019\u1004\u103a\u1038), which features dried fruits and buttered rice.[64] In Iraq and in the states of the Persian Gulf, biryani (\u0628\u0631\u064a\u0627\u0646\u064a: \"biryani\") is usually saffron-based with chicken usually being the meat or poultry of choice. It is popular throughout Iraq, especially in the Kurdistan Region.  Most variations also include vermicelli, fried onions, fried potato cubes, almonds, and raisins spread liberally over the rice.[16] Sometimes, a sour/spicy tomato sauce is served on the side (maraq). In Iran, during the Safavid dynasty (1501\u20131736), a dish called Beriyan Polo (Nastaliq script: \u0628\u0631\u06cc\u0627\u0646 \u067e\u0644\u0648) was made with lamb or chicken, marinated overnight\u2014with yogurt, herbs, spices, dried fruits like raisins, prunes or pomegranate seeds\u2014and later cooked in a tannour oven, then served with steamed rice.[citation needed] A different dish called biryan is popular in Afghanistan. Biryan traces its origins to the same source as biryani, when most of Afghanistan was part of Kabul and Qandahar Subahs and as today sold in Afghanistan as well as in Bhopal, India. Biryan is prepared by cooking gosht and rice together, but without the additional gravy (yakhni) and other condiments that are used in biryani. The Delhi-based historian Sohail Hashmi refers to the biryan as midway between pulao and biryani.  Afghan biryani tends to use much dry fruit such as raisins and lesser amounts of meat, often cut into tiny pieces.[22] Nasi kebuli is an Indonesian spicy steamed rice dish[65] cooked in goat meat broth, milk and ghee.[66] Nasi kebuli is descended from kabuli palaw which is an Afghani rice dish, similar to biryani served in the Indian subcontinent.[67] Although Indonesia has authentic nasi kebuli, Indonesia also inherited and has local-style of biryani which is known as nasi biryani or nasi briyani. Nasi biryani is popular among and often associated as Acehnese, Arab Indonesian, Indian Indonesian and Malay cuisine.[68] The Malaysian and Singaporean variety of biryani is called nasi briyani or nasi biryani. Although authentic styles of biryani from South India are popular, nasi briyani remains the most popular. The key differences between nasi briyani and Indian biryanis are that the meat in nasi briyani is cooked separately from the rice, and there is more curry, sauce, or gravy present in the nasi briyani than in Indian biryanis.[69] Nasi briyani dishes are very popular in Malaysia and Singapore. As an important part of Malaysian and Singaporean Indian cuisines, they are popularized through mamak stalls, hawker centres, and food courts as well as fine dining restaurants. There are also eateries that sell pork as the main meat of the dish in Singapore.[70][71] Biryani dishes are very popular in Mauritius, especially at Muslim weddings and festivities. It is also widely available at street food places. Mauritian biryanis are often accompanied by an achaar (mango pickles), chilies and salads. Kapampangan cuisine of the Philippines (often in Pampanga) features a special dish called nasing biringyi (chicken saffron rice), that is typically prepared only during special occasions such as weddings, family get-togethers or fiestas. It is not a staple of the Filipino diet as it is difficult to prepare compared to other usual dishes. Nasing biringyi is similar to the nasi briyani dish of Malaysia in style and taste. A version that has merged with the Filipino version of the Spanish paella is known as bringhe.[72] In the Cape Malay culture, a variation of biryani incorporates lentils as a key ingredient in the dish along with meat (usually beef, chicken, seafood or vegetables). The dish is made by cooking the rice and legumes and meat and gravy separately, then mixing it. Uncommonly, it is made using the dum-cooking method. The spices are similar to those used in the original Indian biryani. Variants of biryani exist in the cuisines of Somalia, Kenya, and Tanzania due to centuries of trade between the East African coast and South Asia for centuries, and the more recent migration of Indians to the latter two countries more recently during the British colonial era. Zanzibar has its own form of biryani characterized by the mixture of East African and Indian spices, as well as influences from Arab cuisine. The meat used is most commonly chicken.[73] This variant is similar to the forms of biryani served in Kenya. In Somalia, the descendant of biryani is bariis iskukaris. It is served with chicken, goat, beef, lamb, or camel meat, and spiced with the Somali spice mixture xawaash and other spices. A unique characteristic of bariis and other Somali dishes is the addition of banana on the side to be mixed with the dish. Biryani in Thailand is commonly known as khao mhok (Thai: \u0e02\u0e49\u0e32\u0e27\u0e2b\u0e21\u0e01). It is commonly paired with chicken, beef or even fish and topped with fried garlic. The dish is common in Thai cuisine and is often served with a green sour sauce. Tehari and tehri are various names for the vegetarian adaptation of Biryani but are mainly classified as pulao. It was developed for the Hindu bookkeepers of the Muslim Nawabs. It is prepared by adding potatoes to the rice, as opposed to the case of biryani, where the rice is added to the meat. In Kashmir, tehari is sold as street food. Tehari became more popular during World War II, when meat prices increased substantially and potatoes became the popular substitute in biryani. Hot",
    "Chicken Curry": "Chicken curry or curry/curried chicken is a South Asian dish originating from the Indian subcontinent. It is common in the cuisine of the Indian subcontinent, Caribbean, Southeast Asia, Great Britain, and Kenya. A typical curry from the Indian subcontinent consists of chicken stewed in an onion- and tomato-based sauce, flavoured with ginger, garlic, tomato puree, chilli peppers and a variety of spices, often including turmeric, cumin, coriander, cinnamon, and cardamom. Outside of South Asia, chicken curry is often made with a pre-made spice mixture known as curry powder. Indian cuisine has a large amount of regional variation, with many variations on the basic chicken curry recipe. Indian chicken curry typically starts with whole spices, heated in oil. A sauce is then made with onions, ginger, garlic, and tomatoes, and powdered spices. Bone-in pieces of chicken are then added to the sauce, and simmered until cooked through.[1] In south India, coconut and curry leaves are also common ingredients.[2] Chicken curry is usually garnished with coriander leaves, and served with rice or roti. In south India, chicken curry may be thickened using coconut milk.[3] This dish was introduced to the Caribbean by indentured Indian workers. At that time, the dish was very similar to the chicken curry dish of India, consisting mostly of sauce with few chicken pieces.[citation needed] However, poultry in Trinidad and Tobago was so readily available that the dish began consisting of mainly chicken, flavored with curry spices. Typical preparation includes seasoning and marinating the chicken meat in a green seasoning consisting of culantro, coriander, French thyme, thyme, scallion, onion, garlic, and peppers. Then the curry is prepared by first adding oil to the pot and then adding and cooking curry powder mixed with water, then the chicken.[4] When the chicken is fried, additional ingredients are added, and the dish is left to cook until finished. It is usually served with bread or beans.[5] Curry chicken and its derivatives are also popular in Suriname, Guyana, Jamaica, Martinique, Saint Lucia and other Caribbean territories with Indo-Caribbean influence. In Southeast Asia, where coconuts, and different spices originated, various native dishes made with coconut milk or curry pastes and eaten with rice are often collectively referred to as \"curries\" in English.[6] Examples of these include Thai gaeng gai, Cambodian kari sach moan (Khmer: \u179f\u17b6\u1785\u17cb\u1798\u17b6\u1793\u17cb) and Filipino ginataang manok. Chicken curries feature prominently in the repertoire of Burmese curries and in Burmese ohn no khao sw\u00e8, a noodle soup of coconut milk and curried chicken.[7][8] However, derivatives of Indian chicken curry may be distinguished because they are relatively modern and are made with curry powder, curry tree leaves, or other Indian spices, like the Filipino chicken curry and the Malaysian chicken curry, although they still use ingredients native to Southeast Asia.[9][10] Country captain chicken is a stewed chicken dish flavored with curry powder, popular in parts of the Southern United States. The Hobson-Jobson Dictionary states the following: COUNTRY-CAPTAIN. This is in Bengal the name of a peculiar dry kind of curry, often served as a breakfast dish. We can only conjecture that it was a favourite dish at the table of the skippers of 'country ships,' who were themselves called 'country captains,' as in our first quotation. In Madras the term is applied to a spatchcock dressed with onions and curry stuff, which is probably the original form. [Riddell says: \"Country-captain.\u2014Cut a fowl in pieces; shred an onion small and fry it brown in butter; sprinkle the fowl with fine salt and curry powder and fry it brown; then put it into a stewpan with a pint of soup; stew it slowly down to a half and serve it with rice\" (Ind. Dom. Econ. 176).] 1792.\u2014\"But now, Sir, a Country Captain is not to be known from an ordinary man, or a Christian, by any certain mark whatever.\" \u2014Madras Courier, April 26. c. 1825.\u2014\"The local name for their business was the 'Country Trade,' the ships were 'Country Ships,' and the masters of them 'Country Captains.' Some of my readers may recall a dish which was often placed before us when dining on board these vessels at Whampoa, viz. 'Country Captain.'\"\u2014The Fankwae at Canton (1882), p. 33.[11] This dish dates back to the early 1800s.[citation needed] A British sea captain stationed in Bengal, India, shared the recipe for this dish with some friends at the major shipping port in Savannah, Georgia.[citation needed] In 1940, Mrs. W.L. Bullard from Warm Springs, Georgia served this dish under the name \"Country Captain\" to Franklin D. Roosevelt and General George S. Patton.[12]",
    "Chicken Jalfrezi": "Jalfrezi (/d\u0292\u00e6l\u02c8fre\u026azi/; Bengali: \u099d\u09be\u09b2\u09ab\u09cd\u09b0\u09c7\u099c\u09c0; also jhal frezi, jaffrazi, and many other alternative spellings) is a stir-fried curry dish originating in Bengal and popular throughout South Asia. [2] Jalfrezi means \"hot-fry\".[3] It consists of a main ingredient such as meat, fish, paneer or vegetables, stir-fried and served in a thick spicy sauce that includes green chilli peppers.[4] Common further ingredients include bell peppers, onions and tomatoes. Jalfrezi recipes appeared in cookbooks of British India as a way of using up leftovers by frying them with chilli and onion.[5] This English-language usage derived from the colloquial Bengali term jh\u0101l porhez\u012b: jh\u0101l means spicy food; porhez\u012b means suitable for a diet.[6][7] Jalfrezi is usually prepared by stir-frying ingredients, a technique introduced to the region by Chinese cuisine. Jalfrezi is typically made from green peppers, onions, and tomatoes.[8] Additional ingredients include spices like paprika and coriander.[9] Vegetables or meat are then stir-fried into the mix.[10] Jalfrezi is often served alongside pulao.[2] In a survey in 2011, jalfrezi was rated the most popular dish in UK Indian and broader South Asian restaurants.[11][12]  This Bangladeshi cuisine\u2013related article is a stub.

    "Chicken Korma": "Korma or qorma (Urdu: \u0642\u0648\u0631\u0645\u06c1; Hindi: \u0915\u093c\u094b\u0930\u092e\u093e; Bengali: \u0995\u09cb\u09b0\u09ae\u09be; Persian: \u0642\u0631\u0645\u0627) is a dish with its origin in the Indian subcontinent,[1] consisting of meat or vegetables braised with yogurt, water or stock, and spices to produce a thick sauce or gravy.[2] The English name is an anglicisation of the Hindi-Urdu qorm\u0101 (\u0915\u093c\u094b\u0930\u092e\u093e, \u0642\u0648\u0631\u0645\u06c1), meaning \"braise\".[3][4] It refers to the cooking technique used in the dish.[2][5] All these words, and the names of dishes such as the Iranian ghormeh (Persian: \u0642\u0648\u0631\u0645\u0647), Turkish Kavurma and the Azerbaijani qovurma or kavarma, are ultimately derived from a Turkic word qawirma, meaning \"[a] fried thing\".[4] The Indian korma is, however, possibly unrelated in a culinary sense to the modern Turkish kavurma or to some other dishes using the same root word, as they use widely varying techniques and ingredients.[6] Korma has its roots in the Mughlai cuisine[1] of the Indian subcontinent. A characteristic Mughal dish, it can be traced back to the 16th century and to the Mughal expansion into South Asia. Kormas were often prepared in the Mughal court kitchens, such as the famous white korma, perhaps garnished with vark, was said to have been served to Shah Jahan and his guests at the inauguration of the Taj Mahal.[7] Classically, a korma is defined as a dish where meat or vegetables are braised with yogurt or stock. The technique covers many different styles of korma. The flavour of a korma is based on the mixture of spices, including ground coriander and cumin, combined with yogurt kept below curdling temperature and incorporated slowly and carefully with the meat juices. Traditionally, this would have been carried out in a pot set over a very low fire, with charcoal on the lid to provide all-round heat. A korma can be mildly spiced or fiery and may use lamb, goat meat, chicken, beef or game; some kormas combine meat and vegetables, such as spinach and turnip. The term shahi (English: royal), used for some kormas, indicates its status as a prestige dish, rather than an everyday meal, and its association with the court. The korma style is similar to other braising techniques in that the meat or vegetable is first cooked briskly, or seared, using high heat, traditionally with ghee, and then subjected to long, slow cooking using moist heat and a minimum of added liquid.[2] The pot may be sealed with dough during the last stages of cooking, using a technique called dum or dampokhtak.[2] The korma is made using a technique called bagar. in the later stage of cooking, additional spices are mixed with heated ghee and then combined with the sauce formed by the braising. The pan is then covered and shaken to release steam and mix the contents.[8] There is a wide variation between individual korma and other \"curry\" recipes. Chilli and ginger are often used, but the precise method of preparation results in widely different flavors. Indian bay leaves or dried coconut may be added, the latter being a predominantly South Indian flavoring. A korma pilau (pilaf) is a rice and meat dish made with braised meat.[9] In the United Kingdom, a typical korma as served in curry houses is a mildly spiced dish with a thick sauce. It often features almonds, cashews or other nuts, and coconut or coconut milk. In the 21st century, chicken korma has several times been cited as the most popular curry in the UK, replacing chicken tikka masala in surveys of public eating habits.[10][11] Navratan korma is a vegetarian korma made with vegetables and either paneer (an Indian cheese) or nuts \u2013 or sometimes both.[12] Navratan means \"nine gems\", and it is common for the recipe to include nine different vegetables. In some parts of South Asia, korma is used to denote a traditional Eid al-Adha (festival of the sacrifice) dish of lamb, goat, or cow that is braised in minimal or no spices. The flavour comes from the meat and fat of the chosen cuts. It was often done to preserve meats for a short-term period, as the fat layer forms a barrier to help prevent spoilage, similar to potted beef. In Malaysia, korma or 'gulai kurma' is traditionally cooked with coconut milk instead of yoghurt among the Malays, as dairy products do not feature heavily in Malay cuisine. Meats used for kurma include chicken, mutton, beef, and deer. It also often contains more vegetables, such as carrots, potatoes, and tomatoes, though this is not a hard-and-fast rule. Some recipes include tamarind as the souring agent, in place of the natural acidity of yoghurt.[13]",
    "Chicken Madras": " Madras curry or Madras sauce is a curry sauce.[1] Madras is brown in colour and is made with heavy use of chili powder. Raita is often used as an accompaniment to the dish. Madras curry is said to originate from the south of India, and gets its name from the city of Madras (now Chennai). There are many variations on Madras curry[2][3] and cooking in India is more a domestic practice than a cuisine governed by the conventions of chefs, restaurants, or texts. This curry can be vegetarian or made with meat. Availability of local or locally available ingredients is central to regional Indian foods. The result of the signatures of Madras curries can be achieved through different means; the result often being that of: red colour; roasted spices; the sour-sweet fruitiness of tamarind; a slight liquorice flavour of anise; ginger; a range of other spices (sweet and savoury and earthy) and the flavours of salt, sweet and sour. The redness is achieved with chilli or a mixture of chilli and paprika, and the orange of turmeric. Additional sourness may be had from lemon, lime or vinegar. The spices are complementary to the savoury flavours, which may include garlic and possibly onion or asafoetida. Garam masala, coriander, and black peppercorns may also be part of the spice mixture. Common ingredients may also include fresh curry leaves, and the final addition of fresh coriander. The variations include the roasting of many of the spices including dried chillis, coriander seed, aniseed, cumin and cinnamon. This can be done in an oven for 10 minutes at 180\u00a0\u00b0C, or in a frying pan with no oil at low heat. A basic spice mix for Madras curry can be made when these dried roasted ingredients are ground in a mortar and pestle or coffee grinder and mixed with turmeric and stored in readiness for use. Variations are also related to means of storage. The primary spice ingredients can be stored as roasted dried ground powder, a paste of dried ingredients with vinegar, or an oil spice infusion. If meat is used it may be lamb, beef, or chicken. When made of lamb it is called Gosht (or Ghoust) Madras. Common accompaniments to Madras curry include raita and fresh coriander. The food of southern India is more likely to have rice as the main carbohydrate than any breads e.g. naan. Individual households will express their own traditions. Other common variations will include brown mustard seeds which are fried till they pop, black peppercorns (a local tropical product) and vinegar as the acidulant instead of, or with, the acid fruits. The dried roasted spices may be cooked in ghee or vegetable oil and then other major fresh ingredients such as garlic and ginger are added with the vegetables and/or meat. The sweet and sour ingredients such as tamarind and lemon juice/vinegar is added later. Finally the fresh coriander is added immediately prior to serving. Other variations may include the use of cloves, bay leaves, fenugreek and allspice. Hot",
    "Chicken Masala": " Chicken tikka masala is a dish consisting of roasted marinated chicken chunks (chicken tikka) in a spiced sauce. The sauce is usually creamy and orange-coloured. The dish was created by cooks from South Asia living in Great Britain and is offered at restaurants around the world. Chicken tikka masala is composed of chicken tikka, boneless chunks of chicken marinated in spices and yogurt that are roasted in an oven, served in a creamy sauce.[1][2] A tomato and coriander sauce is common, but no recipe for chicken tikka masala is standard; a survey found that of 48 different recipes, the only common ingredient was chicken.[3][4] The sauce usually includes tomatoes (frequently as pur\u00e9e), cream, coconut cream and a masala spice mix. The sauce and chicken pieces may be coloured orange using foodstuffs such as turmeric, paprika, tomato pur\u00e9e or with food dye. Chicken tikka masala is similar to butter chicken, both in the method of creation and appearance.[5] The origin of the dish is not certain, but many sources attribute it to the South Asian community in Great Britain; some sources cite Glasgow as the city of origin.[2][6][7][8] Chicken tikka masala may derive from butter chicken, a popular dish in the northern Indian subcontinent. The Multicultural Handbook of Food, Nutrition and Dietetics credits its creation to Bangladeshi migrant chefs in Britain in the 1960s. They developed and served a number of new inauthentic \"Indian\" dishes, including chicken tikka masala.[9] Historians of ethnic food Peter and Colleen Grove discuss multiple claims regarding the origin of chicken tikka masala, concluding that the dish \"was most certainly invented in Britain, probably by a Bangladeshi chef.\"[10] They suggest that \"the shape of things to come may have been a recipe for Shahi Chicken Masala in Mrs Balbir Singh\u2019s Indian Cookery published in 1961.\"[10] Another claim is that it originated in a restaurant in Glasgow, Scotland.[11][1] This version recounts how a British Pakistani chef, Ali Ahmed Aslam, proprietor of a restaurant in Glasgow, invented chicken tikka masala by improvising a sauce made from a tin of condensed tomato soup, and spices.[12][13][7] Peter Grove challenged any claim that Aslam was the creator of the dish on grounds that the dish was known to exist several years before his restaurant opened.[14] Chef Anita Jaisinghani, a correspondent in the Houston Chronicle, wrote that \"the most likely story is that the modern version was created during the early \u201970s by an enterprising Indian chef near London\" who used Campbell's tomato soup.[15] However, restaurant owner Iqbal Wahhab claims that he and Peter Grove fabricated the story of a chef using tomato soup to create chicken tikka masala  in order \"to entertain journalists\".[16][17][18] Rahul Verma, a food critic who writes for The Hindu,[19] claimed that the dish has its origins in the Punjab region.[20][11] Chicken tikka masala is served in restaurants around the world.[21][22] According to a 2012 survey of 2,000 people in Britain, it was the country's second-most popular foreign dish to cook, after Chinese stir fry.[23] In 2001, British Foreign Secretary Robin Cook mentioned the dish in a speech acclaiming the benefits of Britain's multiculturalism, declaring: Chicken tikka masala is now a true British national dish, not only because it is the most popular, but because it is a perfect illustration of the way Britain absorbs and adapts external influences. Chicken tikka is an Indian dish. The masala sauce was added to satisfy the desire of British people to have their meat served in gravy.[24][25][16][26] Hot",
    "Chicken Rezala": " Bengali cuisine is the culinary style of Bengal, that comprises Bangladesh and the Indian states of West Bengal, Tripura and Assam's Karimganj district.[1] The cuisine has been shaped by the region's diverse history and climate. It is known for its varied use of flavours including mustard oil, as well as the spread of its confectioneries and desserts.[2] There is a strong emphasis on rice as a staple,[3] with fish traditionally the most common protein. Freshwater fish are preferred to seafish, although barramundi, known as bhetki, is also common.[4] Meat is also a common protein among Bengalis with chicken and mutton meat being the most popular. Beef is popular within the muslim community. In more recent times, lentils have begun to form a significant part of the diet.[5] Many Bengali food traditions draw from social activities, such as adda, Poila Boishakh, Mezban, Iftar and Eid feast. Muslims conquered Bengal around the mid-thirteenth century, bringing with them Persian and Arabic cuisine.[6] Such dishes as biryani, korma and bhuna had once been meals of the higher courts, but the cooks of the Mughals brought their recipes to the lower and middle classes.[7] The influence was reinforced during the rule of the British Raj, where Kolkata became the place of refuge for many prominent exiled Nawabs, notably the family of Tipu Sultan from Mysore and Wajid Ali Shah, the ousted Nawab of Awadh. The exiles brought with them hundreds of cooks and masalchis (spice mixers), and as their royal patronage and wealth diminished, they became interspersed into the local population. These cooks came with the knowledge of a very wide range of spices (most notably jafran and mace), the extensive use of ghee, and marinating meat with yoghurt and chilli.[8] In Bangladesh, this food has become common fare for the population while in West Bengal, they have remained the food of professional chefs. Further innovations include chap (ribs slow cooked on a tawa), rezala (meat in a thin yogurt and cardamom gravy) and kathi roll (kebabs in a wrap).[8] The Mughals had a particular fixation on meat, bringing mutton and beef into mainstream Bengali cuisine as well as already known kinds of meat like chicken and venison.[7] Furthermore, traditional desserts had been primarily based on rice pastes and jaggery, but under Mughal influence moved towards significantly increased use of milk, cream, and sugar along with expensive spices such as cardamom and saffron.[7] In Hindu tradition, widows were not allowed to eat foods that would not be classified as \"bitter\", necessitating experiment and innovation.[9] While most Bengali castes ate meat and fish, this was barred for widows. Widows also could not use \"heating\" foods such as shallot and garlic, but ginger was allowed. This style found a core place in Bengali curries in general, both vegetarian and non-vegetarian. Expensive spices such as saffron, cinnamon or cloves were used very sparingly\u2014if at all. Nuts, dry fruits, milk and milk products (such as cream, ghee or curd) were similarly scarce.[10] These economic and social restrictions influenced Bengali widows to create a brand new set of meals that utilized only vegetables and cheap spices. The large-scale displacement along religious lines as a result of the partition led to changes in meal-taking, so as to adhere to religious restrictions. In Bangladesh (former East Bengal and East Pakistan), Mughlai food is common, and includes foods that are less popular in West Bengal, such as beef kebab. Additionally, sweets such as zarda and firni-payesh are eaten. In rural Bangladesh, many people eat makna fried, popped, or raw.[11][12] During the colonial period, many Western food shops were established in Kolkata, making puff pastries, channa, chocolate, and chips especially popular. Dishes such as chop, gravy cutlet, sponge rasogolla, and ledikeni.[11] As a result of a multi-cultural community, Kolkata city's cuisine continuously changes, and takes heavy influence from Chinese and European palates.[12][13] Bengali cuisine can be subdivided into four different types of dishes: eatables (\u0996\u09be\u09a6\u09cd\u09af, \u09ad\u0995\u09cd\u09b7\u09cd\u09af, or \u09ad\u09cb\u099c\u09cd\u09af); \u099a\u09b0\u09cd\u09ac\u09cd\u09af, ch\u00f4rby\u00f4, or chewables, such as rice or fish; \u099a\u09cb\u09b7\u09cd\u09af, choshy\u00f4, or suckables, such as ambal and tak; \u09b2\u09c7\u09b9\u09cd\u09af, lehy\u00f4, or lickables, like chutney; and \u09aa\u09c7\u09af\u09bc, pey\u00f4, or drinkables which includes drinks, mainly milk.[14] Different parts of Bengal are famed for certain dishes, food items and ingredients. For example, South Bengali districts around the Sundarbans boast of the expensive chui jhal chilli, which they peel and chop into small pieces to be cooked in their dishes and give off a strong aroma. On the other hand, North Bengal  are the homes of many Bengali desserts such as the Mishti doi of Bogra, the Kachagolla of Natore and the Chomchom of Porabari. However, other regions also have famous desserts like the Balish Mishti (pillow-sweet) of Netrokona, the Monda of Muktagachha, the Red Yoghurt of Nabadwip and the famed Roshmolai of Comilla. Chittagonian Bengali culinary tradition is mostly known for Mezban and mixed rice dishes like kala bhuna, which has shoulder pieces of beef and traditional spices. Dried fish (shutki) is more available in the Chittagong region than in other parts of Bengal.[15] Mezban (locally known as Mejjan) is the Bengali word for special occasion feasts in the Chittagong region of Bangladesh.[16] Historically Mezbani is a traditional regional feast where people are invited to enjoy a meal with white rice and beef, besides other dishes rich in animal fat and dairy.[17] It is held on the occasions such as death anniversary, birth anniversary, celebrating successes, launching of a new business, entry into a new house, the birth of a child, marriage, aqiqah and circumcision, ear piercing of girls and naming of the newborn.[16][17] The invitation of the Mezban ceremony generally remains open for all and various people to different places and neighbourhoods convey the invitation for the feast. In urban areas, attending a mezban is by invitation only. Usually, the consumption of food at Mezbani takes place from morning to afternoon.[16] Beef-based dishes are preferred by Bengali Muslims and are a symbol of social prestige for a Mezban feast.[17] The rich and the poor arrange feasts on various occasions as much as circumstances allow them. It has a distinct style of cooking and proper Mezban meat demands a certain skill;[17] for example:[16] The unique beef curry served in this feast is known as Mezbani gosht, that carries a distinctive recipe, knowledge of which is essentially confined within the Chittagonian cooks.[18] Fish is used instead of beef while cooking Mezban in Hindu tradition. The Hindu community of Chittagong organises Mezbani each year under the banner of \"Chittagong Parishad\", with curries made from fish, vegetable and dried fish.[16] Dhakaiya food is one of the most notable regional Bengali cuisines. The rich culinary customs are influenced by Mughlai, Central Asian, Armenian, Hindustani and native Bengali cuisines. However, it also has dishes unique to Dhaka.[19] The Nawabs of Dhaka had brought Mughlai cuisine to Bengal, that were wholly retained by Dhaka's culinary community. Due to the high costs of producing Mughlai food, the recipes were limited to the elite classes in colonial India, and slowly expanded as Bangladesh's economy grew. The main focus on lamb, mutton, beef, yoghurt, and mild spices define the taste of the style. Such dishes as kebab; stuffed breads; kacchi biriyani; roast lamb, duck, and chicken; patisapta; Kashmiri tea; and korma are still served at special occasions like Eid and weddings.[12][20] Due to the high class of the food, using an excess amount of expensive ingredients like ghee, and making the food melt in one's mouth were essential to the feel of the food.[21] Old Dhaka boasts a variation of the famous pilaf - the Morog Polao - in which the rice is cooked after and the chicken pieces are cut. Other polaos include ilish polao and rui polao. Dhakaiyas are noted for introducing paneer and boiled eggs to khichuri.[19] Dhakai bakarkhani is a thick, biscuit-like flat-bread which is a traditional street-food snack, famed for its quality and taste. It is mainly dished up with tea.[22][23] Dhakaiyas proudly hold a heritage of creating the best khili paan using various herbs and spices. They also offer a khili paan for diabetic patients called the \"paan afsana\".[24] Haji biryani is a dish, invented by a restaurateur in 1939, made with highly seasoned rice, goat's meat and number of spices and nuts. The restaurant has become an integral part of Dhakaiya culture.[25] In Kolkata, many local street vendors own small shops from which they sell their own homemade goods.[26] Items like cheeses (paneer) can be eaten as is, or can be made into sweet sandesh, rosomalai, rosogolla, or chanar payesh. Milk is especially used in Kolkata's various types of payesh, differing in use of different grains and additives like dates, figs, and berries.[27][28] In addition to European foodstuffs like chocolate, Kolkata takes culinary influence from its Chinese diaspora.[29] Phuchka, known the rest of India as panipuri, is a common kind of Bengali street food made with a fried dough casing and a potato and chickpea filling, usually found in small stalls alongside bhelpuri, masala chai, ghugni and chaat stalls.[30] During the 19th century many Odia cooks migrated to Bengal to work in the households of affluent Kolkata families. They were also hired to cook in weddings and other family ceremonies. Introduction of Odia cooks into their kitchens brought in subtle but significant changes to Kolkata's cuisine. Some of Kolkata's classic dishes were originally from Odisha but were refined in Kolkata kitchens by Odia cooks. In fact some researchers say that dishes like kanika (Bengali mishti pulao) were first introduced to Kolkata kitchens by Odia cooks although this is contested by other researchers.[31][32] Even to this date most of the cooks in Kolkata kitchens and hotels are Odia cooks.[33] The Chinese of Kolkata originally settled into a village called Achipur south of Kolkata in the late 18th century, later moving into the city and finally into its present home in Tangra at the eastern edge of Kolkata.[34] The Chinese-origin people of Kolkata form a substantial and successful community with a distinct identity.[35] With this identity came Chinese food, available at almost every street corner in Kolkata at present, due to the taste, quick cooking procedure, and no similarity with the original Chinese recipe other than the use of soy sauce. They were mostly Cantonese tradesmen and sailors who first settled down here and decided to cook with whatever items they had at hand.[36] Calcuttan immigrants to other countries have started carrying this abroad as well;[35] Indian Chinese restaurants have appeared in many places in the United States and UK.[37] Indian Chinese food has been given a second boost in popularity since the 1950s when a large number of Tibetans migrated into Indian Territory, following the 14th Dalai Lama's flight.[38] Tibetans brought their own taste preferences to add to the genre, such as the popular momo (a kind of dumpling) or thukpa (a hearty noodle soup). Tibetans and Nepali immigrants found ready employment in the many kitchens that can now be found on virtually every street in Kolkata.[39][40] Adda (Bengali: \u0986\u09a1\u09cd\u09a1\u09be) is a traditional Bengali means of socialising over food during the work day. Food taken during adda consists usually of mishti or sweetmeats, tea, and coffee, although heartier meats such as fried fish may be brought out as well. The adda saw a rise during the colonial era among the Bhadralok guild members to meet and talk about a range of topics:[41] \"You could be discussing Charles and Camilla's marriage this moment, and the next moment you're swinging over to the latest cricket series between India and Pakistan, and then swing back to the recent controversy over Tagore.\"[42] Being a hobby for artisans, women were largely secluded from adda, a sentiment that has begun to disappear with the democratization of adda and women occupying a larger space in social life. For this reason, adda was seen as a refuge \"...from the home, a neutral rendezvous away from both the perceived drudgery of the workplace and domesticity\".[41] In the post-colonial era, the adda has been fading due to the more rigid structure of work and exploitative perceptions of unnecessary laziness. This has inspired a sizeable movement of Bengalis who believe it integral to the idea of lyadh, or doing nothing to relax and recharge.[41] However, adda does still exist, being attended during vacation time or after work at clubs or coffee shops. The tradition even has an equivalent to the Greek symposium, as students may meet for a study session over food or have a teacher teach in a more relaxed environment.[43] Sylhet boasts a variation of the famous pilaf dish \u2013 Akhni polao \u2013 in which the rice is cooked after and the chicken pieces are cut. Commonly consumed varieties of meat include beef, chicken, mutton and duck/goose in dishes such as Hash O Bash. They also proudly hold the heritage of Beef Hatkora, a rice dish consisting of a wild citrus fruit not found in other parts of Bengal.[44] During the British period, biscuits and loaves were introduced in Sylhet and received popularity within the Muslim community. The middle-class Hindus of Cachar and Sylhet however were very suspicious of biscuits and breads as they believed they were baked by Muslims. In one occasion, a few Hindus in Cachar caught some Englishman eating biscuits with tea which caused an uproar. The information reached the Hindus of Sylhet and a little rebellion occurred. In response to this, companies started to advertise their bread as \"machine-made\" and \"untouched by (Muslim) hand\" to tell Hindus that the breads were \"safe for consumption\". This incident is mentioned in Bipin Chandra Pal's autobiography and he mentions how gradually culinary habits of Hindus eventually changed.[45] Bengali food is often served on plates which have a distinct flowery pattern often in blue or pink. Another characteristic of Bengali food is the use the boti (also called dao or da). It is a long curved blade on a platform held down by one or both feet; both hands are used to hold whatever is being cut and move it against the blade, which faces the user. This method gives effective control over the cutting process, and can be used to cut anything from prawns to large pumpkins.[46] A korai is a cooking vessel for most Bengali sauces and stir-fry. The dekchi (a flat-bottomed pan) is used generally for larger amounts of cooking or for making rice. It comes with a thin flat lid which is used also to strain out the starch while finishing up cooking rice. The tawa is used to make roti and paratha.[47] The other prominent cooking utensil is a hari, which is a round-bottomed pot-like vessel. The three mentioned vessels all come in various sizes and in various metals and alloys.[48] A flat metal spatula, khunti, is used often, along with hata (scoop with a long handle), jhanjri (round-shaped sieve-like spatula to deep-fry food), the shanrashi (pincers to remove vessels from the fire), the ghuntni (wooden hand blender) for pur\u00e9eing dal, the wooden belun chaki (round pastry board and rolling pin), and the shil nora, which is a rough form of a mortar and pestle or grinding stone. The kuruni is used only to grate coconuts.[49] Silverware is not a part of traditional Bengali cookery.[49] Bengalis usually eat sitting on the floor with food served on a dostorkhan. They historically ate without silverware,[50] with a large banana or plantain leaf serving as the plate, or with plates made from dried sal leaves sewn together. It is customary to offer guests food and drink appropriate to the time of their visit. At meals, guests are served first, with the possible exception of very old or very young members of the host family. Within the family, serving starts with the senior males (those of highest social rank or eldest). School-age children are served before wives, daughter-in-laws, and the cook, who are the last to eat.[50] Prior to colonisation, adherence to meal order was a marker of social status, but with British and Portuguese influence and the growth of the middle class, this has slowly disappeared. Courses are frequently skipped or combined with everyday meals.[43][failed verification] Meals were usually served course by course to the diners by the youngest housewives, but increasing influence of nuclear families and urbanisation has replaced this.[51][self-published source] It is common to place everything on platters in the centre of the table, and each diner serves themselves. Ceremonial occasions such as weddings used to have elaborate serving rituals, but professional catering and buffet-style dining is now commonplace. However, large family occasions and more lavish ceremonial feasts may still abide by these rules.[51][52] Daily meals are usually simple, geared to balance nutrition and making extensive use of vegetables. The courses progress broadly from lighter to richer and heavier and go through various tastes and taste cleansers. Rice remains common throughout the meal and is the main constituent of the meal, until the cha\u0163ni (chutney) course.[53] Fish is a core part of the Bengali diet, and is the main source of protein. Bengalis typically use freshwater and brackish fish when making meals. Spices are used heavily in the preparation of fish, and the fish is usually served either as a curry or a fried steak. Popular fish curries include boal, rohu, ilish, and pabda. One tradition includes the left side of the cidal fish being cooked in oil.[54] Bengali Vaishnavas avoid all types of fish, eggs and meat. Bengali sweets have a long history. The Portuguese friar Sebastien Manrique, travelling in the region in the 17th century, noted the multitude of milk-based foods and sweets prepared in traditional ways.[55] Falooda, shahi jilapi and shemai are popular sweet foods and desserts. Roshogolla, a Bengali traditional sweet, is one of the most widely consumed sweets in India. It spread to Bengal in 1868. Chhana based sweets were introduced in Eastern India from about the 18th century; as the process and technology involved in synthesizing \"Chhana\" was introduced to the Indians by the Dutch in the 1790s. The cottage cheese \"schmierkase\" was also known as Dutch cheese.[56] The earlier versions of Rossogolla lacked binding capacity of the modern avatar that is well known and highly acclaimed today. This was due to the fact that the know-how involved in synthesizing such a sweet was unknown before being experimentally developed by Nobin Chandra Das and then constantly improved and further standardized by his successors. Furthermore, the \"chhana\" manufactured in those days was a coarse and granular variety and had low binding capacity. It was made by citric and ascorbic acid from natural fruit extracts. This type of \"chhana\" cannot be worked on to compact into any regular and firm shape for the purpose of sweet-making, leave alone making Rossogolla. This is because of a documented technological issue \u2013 lactic acid (extracted from whey) used to curdle milk now was introduced to India in the late 18th century by Dutch and Portuguese colonists (along with acetic acid).[57] It is this method that creates the fine, smooth modern \"chhana\" with high binding capacity \u2013 which is now the staple raw material for Bengali confectioners. At present, Nobin Chandra Das is referred to have invented the spongy variant of rossogolla.[58] Laddu (or as it is known as \"darbesh\" in Bengal) is a very common sweet in West Bengal and Bangladesh, as well as the rest of the subcontinent, especially during celebrations and festivities.[59][60] They are usually made out of flour, ghee/butter/oil and sugar. Alternative recipes can be made of coconut shavings and jaggery, raisins, chopped nuts, oatmeal, khoa, nutmeg, cardamom, or poppy seeds, among other ingredients.[61][62][63][64] The sweet dates back to the year 4 BCE, where it was used for medicinal purposes and to keep the hormones of 9-11-year-old girls' hormones \"in check\".[65] Pantua is similar to gulab jamun, and could be called a Bengali variant of that dish.[66] Several varieties of doi such as mish\u0163i doi, fruit-floured doi like aam doi, custards, and rice pudding (khir or firni)[67] are also popular in West Bengal. Sh\u00f4ndesh, chhanar jilapi, kalo jam, raghobshai, \"pantua\", \"jolbhora shondesh\",[68] \"roshbhora\", \"lord chomchom\", payesh, bundiya, nalengurer sh\u00f4ndesh, malpoa, shor bhaja, langcha, babarsa, and a variety of others are examples of sweets in Bengali cuisine. Common beverages include shorbot, lachhi, ghol, matha, falooda and Rooh Afza. The two main types of Bengali tea are dudh cha (milk tea) and masala cha. Srimangal, the tea capital of Bengal, is famed for the Seven Color Tea whilst Dhaka is famed for the borhani. Traditional fruit juices (rosh) are also drunk such as sugarcane juice, mango juice, palm fruit juice, date juice as well as basil seed or tukma-based drinks.",
    "Chicken Soup": " Chicken soup is a soup made from chicken, simmered in water, usually with various other ingredients. The classic chicken soup consists of a clear chicken broth, often with pieces of chicken or vegetables; common additions are pasta, noodles, dumplings, or carrots, and grains such as rice and barley. Chicken soup is commonly considered a comfort food.[1] Humans were already boiling food by the time that chicken was domesticated in the neolithic period, so it is likely that chickens were being boiled for soup.[2] Modern American chicken soup, which typically includes root vegetables such as carrot, onion, leeks and celery, was a staple across Northern Europe and was brought to the United States by immigrants.[3] Variations on the flavor are gained by adding root vegetables such as parsnip, potato, sweet potato and celery root; herbs such as bay leaves, parsley and dill; other vegetables such as zucchini, whole garlic cloves, lettuce, or tomatoes; and black pepper.[4][5] The soup should be brought slowly to a boil and then simmered in a covered pot on a very low flame for one to three hours, adding water if necessary. Saffron or turmeric are sometimes added as a yellow colorant. Chicken soup can be a relatively low fat food: fat can be removed by chilling the soup after cooking and skimming the layer of congealed fat from the top.[6] A study determined that \"prolonged cooking of a bone in soup increases the calcium content of the soup when cooked at an acidic, but not at a neutral pH\".[7] Strictly speaking, chicken soup, unless qualified, implies that the soup is served as a thin broth, with pieces of meat, and possibly vegetables, and either noodles, rice, barley, or dumplings. Cream of chicken soup is a thick, creamy, soup made with chicken stock and pieces, combined with milk (or cream) and flour, which might contain vegetable pieces, depending on the recipe. Several terms are used when referring to chicken soups: Chicken soup has long been touted as a form of folk medicine to treat respiratory infections.[13] In 2000, scientists at the University of Nebraska Medical Center in Omaha studied the effect of chicken soup on the inflammatory response in vitro. They found that some components of the chicken soup inhibit neutrophil migration, which may have an anti-inflammatory effect that could hypothetically lead to temporary ease from symptoms of illness.[14] However, since these results have been obtained from purified cells (and directly applied), the diluted soup in vivo effect is debatable. The New York Times reviewed the University of Nebraska study, among others, in 2007 and concluded that \"none of the research is conclusive, and it is not known whether the changes measured in the laboratory really have a meaningful effect on people with cold symptoms.\"[15] It has also been shown that chicken soup contains the amino acid cysteine, which is very similar to acetylcysteine, which is used by doctors for patients with bronchitis and other respiratory infections.[16] Chicken soup is also known as \"Jewish penicillin\",[17] either as ersatz penicillin,[18] or as alternative to penicillin.[19] Many Chinese soups are based on chicken broth. Typical Chinese chicken soup is made from old hens and is seasoned with ginger, scallions, black pepper, soy sauce, rice wine and sesame oil.[20] A more elaborate version can be made from freshly killed spent hen and various herbs such as ginseng, dried goji, and old ginger root.[21] The soup is then boiled for hours. Bogot\u00e1, Colombia's capital, is known for a version of chicken soup called ajiaco.[22] Along with chicken, ajiaco typically includes maize, three types of potatoes, avocado, capers, and a herb called guascas, and is served with a dollop of cream. Sancocho de gallina is another popular dish throughout Colombia and in neighboring countries. This is a broth that includes entire pieces of (often rather tough) soup hen on the bone with large pieces of plantain, potato, cassava and/or other vegetables.[23] A bowl of sancocho is usually an entire meal. The Danish h\u00f8nsek\u00f8dssuppe is traditionally cooked using large hens specifically reserved for soup, known as suppeh\u00f8ner (\"soup-hens\"). Vegetables like celeriac, carrots, onions and leek are usually added and typical flavourings are thyme, laurels and white pepper. The soup may be served with small white dumplings and meatballs. As part of traditional housekeeping, the cooked meat is reserved for other dishes such as h\u00f8ns i asparges (\"hens in asparagus\") or h\u00f8nsesalat (\"hens-salad\").[24] The French serve chicken-based forms of bouillon and consomm\u00e9. Typical French seasonings for chicken soup includes: bay leaves, fresh thyme, dry white wine and garlic.[25] In Germany, chicken soup is made with chicken broth, vegetables, such as carrots, spices and herbs and small noodles. For the broth, a large hen, called a Suppenhuhn (lit.: \"soup hen\"), may be boiled, and pieces of it\u2014especially from the boiled breast\u2014can later be added to the soup.[26]\nIn southern Germany, homemade chicken soup typically consists of chicken broth, to which spices and semolina dumplings or noodles are added. Another dish made with chicken broth, pieces of chicken, boiled vegetables, and spices is known as H\u00fchnereintopf,[27] meaning \"chicken stew\". Alternatively, homemade noodles may be added to the chicken broth, without vegetables, and with only pickling spice, salt and pepper added to it. In Ghana, chicken soup, also known as Chicken Light soup is made by cooking the chicken in a blended mixture of tomatoes,  onions,  pepper and other spices and sometimes garden eggs and is served primarily with fufu or on its own.[28] In Greece, chicken soup is most commonly made in the avgolemono (\"egg-lemon\") fashion, wherein beaten eggs mixed with lemon are added to a broth slowly so that the mixture heats up without curdling, also adding rice or pasta like krithar\u00e1ki (\"little barley;\" orzo), resulting in a thicker texture; it is a traditional remedy for colds, stomach aches, and hangovers.[29] Hungarian chicken soup is a clear soup, a consomm\u00e9, called \u00dajh\u00e1zi chicken soup.[30] A consomm\u00e9 with entire pieces of chicken, chicken liver and heart, with chunky vegetables and spices like whole black peppercorn, bay leaves, salt and ground black pepper. The vegetables boiled along with the pieces of chicken are usually carrots, celeriac, parsley root[31] and parsnip. Soup vermicelli, semolina dumplings or thin Sp\u00e4tzle noodles or small dumplings are also added to the soup. Even other vegetables may be used, such as green peas, a whole tomato and whole onions boiled along with the soup, mushrooms, asparagus, celery, green pepper, cauliflower, kohlrabi, green beans or parsley, in different combinations. In Indonesia, chicken soup might appear as sayur sop, vegetable and chicken broth soup that contains chicken pieces, potato, green beans, carrot, celery, and fried shallot.[32] Another chicken soup variant commonly found across the country is soto ayam;[33] a turmeric yellow spicy chicken soup with vegetables and noodle or vermicelli, served with steamed rice, pieces of lontong or ketupat.[34] In Italy, chicken soup is often served with pasta, in such dishes as cappelletti in brodo, tortellini in brodo and passatelli.[35] Even when served on its own, the meat and any vegetables used are usually removed from the broth and served as a second dish.[36] In Japan, chicken soup is known as torijiru.[37]  Typically it starts with dashi, which is made from boiling konbu (kelp) and katsuobushi (dried skipjack tuna flakes), and not by boiling the chicken (whole chicken is not typically available in Japanese supermarkets)[citation needed]. After the dashi is prepared, pieces of boneless chicken thigh meat are usually used and combined with vegetables like daikon radish, carrot, burdock, konnyaku, welsh onion, mushrooms, potatoes, and taro root. At the end, different seasonings are added depending on the region of the country or type of soup. It could be a miso-based soup or soy sauce-based. Cooking sake, mirin, salt, and vinegar are also used with the soy sauce or miso. The pork equivalent called butajiru is more popular than the chicken-based soup.[38] Bone stocks for ramen are also often made with chicken stock, and it is almost invariably used in the less common kotteri variety.[39] Chicken soup is a traditional dish of the European Jewish kitchen. The Russian and Polish Jewish communities use a relatively high proportion of chicken stock for their soup, made mostly from the bones.\nThe soup is prepared with herbs like parsley and fresh dill or thyme, and is often served with knaidlach (matzah balls),[40] kreplach (dumplings), lokshen (flat egg noodles), or mandlen (Shkedei Marak in Israel) (soup \"almonds\"). A traditional garnish was eyerlekh (little eggs). These unlaid chicken eggs were taken from a hen and boiled in the soup.[41][42] Modern health standards make these difficult to obtain now. Samgyetang is a Korean chicken soup with insam (Korean ginseng), daechu (dried jujube fruits), garlic, ginger, glutinous rice, and sometimes other medicinal herbs.[43] It is believed to be not only a cure for physical ailments but also a preventer of sickness.[44] Dak baeksuk, a type of chicken broth with garlic, is also popular among Koreans.[45] It is believed by some to help cure minor illnesses such as the common cold. Some types of baeksuk also contains noodles, similar to chicken noodle soup. Caldo de pollo, also known as Consome de Pollo, is a common Latin-American soup made with whole chicken pieces instead of chopped or shredded chicken, and large cuts of vegetables, such as half-slices of potatoes and whole leaves of cabbage.[46] Another variation of chicken soup is caldo tlalpe\u00f1o which is garnished with chopped avocado, white cheese, and a chipotle chile.[47] Aguadito de pollo is a traditional chicken soup in Peruvian cuisine consisting of chicken, cilantro, vegetables and spices.[48] Caldo de Gallina (lit., \"broth of hen\"), the Peruvian form of chicken soup, is made with whole pieces of chicken instead of chopped or shredded chicken, along with potatoes, egg noodles, and hard-boiled eggs. Lime wedges and chili or aji pepper paste are added as condiments.[49] Chicken soup in the Philippines is called sopas and has some western influences in it. While there are many variations in the recipe, it usually contains chicken strips in broth, onions, vegetables (mainly carrots, cabbage and celery), and macaroni noodles. It is cooked with evaporated milk to give it richer flavor. Sopas is normally associated with the cold, rainy season in the Philippines, and may thus be regarded as local comfort food.[50][51] Another chicken soup is called mami which its style derives from its other Asian neighboring countries, especially East Asia and normally served with sliced chicken, broth, noodles, chopped vegetables. Mami is also associated with the cold, rainy season as well.[52] Other chicken dishes are considered soups. Tinola has chicken cuts in broth, with ginger, chayote, and chili pepper leaves. Sinampalukang manok is sometimes regarded as a chicken version of sinigang, but here the meat is browned first before being boiled in the water and it uses tamarind leaves.[53] Kadyos, manok, kag ubad from the Western Visayas uses pigeon peas and banana pith.[54] The Polish chicken soup is called ros\u00f3\u0142. It is commonly served with fine noodles, boiled carrots and parsley every Sunday.[55] The broth is served separate from chicken meat. There are many types of ros\u00f3\u0142, as: Ros\u00f3\u0142 Kr\u00f3lewski[55] (royal ros\u00f3\u0142), made of three meats: beef or veal, white poultry (hen, turkey or chicken) and dark poultry as duck, goose (crop only), just a couple of dried king boletes, one single cabbage leaf and a variety of vegetables such as parsley, celery, carrot, and leek. The cooking must take at least six hours of sensitive boiling over a small fire.[55] At the end, softly burnt onion is added to the soup. Ros\u00f3\u0142 my\u015bliwski (The hunter's ros\u00f3\u0142) is made of a variety of wild birds[55] as well as pheasant, capercaillie, wood grouse, black grouse, or grey partridge, with a small addition of roe deer meat, a couple of wild mushrooms, and 2\u20133 juniper fruits. Chicken soup is known as canja, a chicken broth prepared with rice or pasta and shredded chicken meat.[56] It is believed to help a person overcome colds and digestive problems, among other mild forms of sickness.[57] In most regions of Romania, chicken soup known as sup\u0103 de pui consists of a clear or dense sour soup with strained chicken and vegetable broth, and either noodles (t\u0103ie\u021bei) or dumplings (g\u0103lu\u0219te) are added.[58] Different versions use pieces of chicken and pieces of boiled vegetables (like onion, carrot, parsnip, celery, zucchini, peas, beans, leaves and root of parsley or peppers) and are seasoned usually with sour cream (sm\u00e2nt\u00e2n\u0103), tomato juice, lemon juice, or bor\u0219.[58] In Taiwan-style chicken soup, dried jujube fruits, dried shiitake, and other various herbs are also sometimes added. While it may be possible to use regular ginseng in the recipe, a special type of ginseng called San qi is commonly used.[59] This is grown almost exclusively in Wenshan County, Yunnan Province. The roots are powdered for ease of use, although it may also be possible to use the flowerheads.[60] East Slavs traditionally prefer an often simple chicken and vegetable bouillon with added noodles or rice, and a pinch of fresh herbs.[61] Another type of chicken soup includes chicken, noodles, carrot, potato and onion.[61] Some cooks add chopped boiled egg and even sour cream to their variations of the soup. Traditionally, chicken soup (or broth) in Britain is a clear and watery soup with chunky vegetables (such as carrot, celery and onion), chicken, salt and pepper. However, a thick, creamy variety called cream of chicken soup,[62] which may not contain any vegetable pieces (depending on the recipe), is more popular today. A distinct version from Scotland that has become popular throughout the UK is cock-a-leekie soup, a clear, thin broth of shredded chicken and leeks.[63] In the United States and Canada, chicken soup often has noodles or rice in it, thus giving it its common name of \"chicken noodle soup\".[64] The term may have been coined in a commercial for the Campbell Soup Company in the 1930s. The original 21 varieties of Campbell's condensed soup featured a \"chicken soup with noodles\", but when it was advertised on the Amos 'n' Andy radio show in the 1930s by a slip of the tongue the soup was referred to as \"chicken noodle soup\".[9] Traditionally, American chicken soup was prepared using old hens too tough and stringy to be roasted or cooked for a short time. In modern times, these fowl are difficult to come by, and broiler chickens (young chickens suitable for roasting or broiling) are often used to make soup.[9] Often (but not always) sold as a condensed soup, canned chicken soup such as Campbell's Chicken Noodle Soup, is notable for its high sodium content:[65] 890\u00a0mg per 1\u20442 cup serving. This gives a 1+1\u20442 cup bowl of soup[66] about 2,500\u00a0mg of sodium, a full day's allowance in the case of this mainstream brand.[67] Other condensed chicken soups produced by Campbell's, such as Chicken with Rice[68] or Chicken & Stars Soup,[69] have similar amounts, as do generic versions of the product.[70] Canned chicken soup with much less sodium than the traditional formulation is available, including many varieties produced by Campbell's, some with as little as 100\u00a0mg of sodium.[65] Campbell's claims production of a chicken noodle soup that will find broad consumer acceptance\u2014in short, that will sell\u2014is very difficult, so it has to balance healthfulness with sodium content.[71] Usually, the main ingredients of this canned soup are:[4][5] Hot",
    "Chicken Tandoori": " Tandoori chicken is a dish made from chicken marinated in yogurt and spices and roasted in a tandoor, a cylindrical clay oven. The dish is now popular worldwide. The modern form of the dish was popularized by the Moti Mahal restaurant in New Delhi, India in the late 1940s. Chicken roasted in tandoor-like ovens is documented in the Harappan civilization of the Bronze Age of Indian subcontinent, as early as 3000 BC.[13][14][15][16][17][18] Much later, the Sushruta Samhita records meat being cooked in an oven (kandu) after being seasoned with black mustard (rai) powder and fragrant spices. Tandoori chicken as a dish originated in the Punjab before the independence of partition of India.[19][20] In the late 1940s, tandoori chicken was popularised at Moti Mahal in the locality of Daryaganj[21][22] in New Delhi by Kundan Lal Jaggi, Kundan Lal Gujral and Thakur Das Magu, who were Punjabi Hindu migrants from Peshawar[10][23][24][25][26] as well as the founders of the Moti Mahal restaurant.[1][2][3][4][25] They used to work at a small eatery called Moti Mahal, owned by a man named Mokha Singh Lamba in Peshawar, British India, from the 1920s to 1947.[5][6][27] Tandoori chicken was popularized in post-independence India by Moti Mahal, Daryaganj in Delhi[28][29] when it was served to the first Prime Minister of India, Jawaharlal Nehru.[30] There, tandoori chicken became a standard offering at official banquets.[30] In the United States, tandoori chicken began appearing on menus by the 1960s. Jacqueline Kennedy was reported to have eaten \"chicken tandoori\" on a flight from Rome to Bombay in 1962.[31] A recipe for tandoori chicken was printed in the Los Angeles Times in 1963, for \"the hostess in search of a fresh idea for a party dinner\";[32] a similar recipe was featured in the same newspaper in 1964.[33] Raw chicken parts are skinned then marinated in a mixture of dahi (yogurt) and tandoori masala, a spice blend. They are seasoned and colored with cayenne pepper, red chili powder, or Kashmiri red chili powder as well as turmeric or food coloring.[a] The marinated chicken is placed on skewers and cooked at high temperatures in a tandoor oven, which is heated with charcoal or wood, which adds to the smoky flavour. The dish can also be cooked in a standard oven, using a spit or rotisserie, or over hot charcoal.[34] There are also tandoori recipes for whole chicken, some of which are cooked in a tandoor and others over charcoal. These include Chirga (Roasted whole chicken); Tandoori Murgh (Roast whole chicken with almonds); Murgh Kabab Seekhi (Whole stuffed chicken on the spit); Kookarh Tandoori (Steamed chicken on spit); Tandoori Murgh Massaledarh (Whole spiced chicken on spit); and Murghi Bhogar (Chicken in the Bhogar style).[35] Tandoori chicken can be eaten as a starter or appetizer, or as a main course, often served with naan flatbread.[36] It is also used as the base of numerous cream-based curries, such as butter chicken.[37] The fame of tandoori chicken led to many derivatives, such as chicken tikka (and eventually the Indian dish popularized in Britain, chicken tikka masala), commonly found in menus in Indian restaurants all over the world.[38] Nearly all derivatives of tandoori chicken begin with a yogurt and citrus-based marinade.[39][40]",
    "Chicken Tikka": "Chicken tikka is a chicken dish popular in India, Bangladesh, Pakistan and the United Kingdom.[1] It is traditionally small pieces of boneless chicken baked using skewers on a brazier called angeethi or over charcoal after marinating in Indian spices and dahi (yogurt)\u2014essentially a boneless version of tandoori chicken.[2] The word tikka (tike in Turkish, and tik\u0259 in Azerbaijani) is a Persian word, meaning \"bits\" or \"pieces\". It is also a chicken dish served in Punjabi cuisine. The Kashmiri version of the dish, however, is grilled over red-hot coals, and does not always contain boneless pieces. The pieces are brushed with ghee (clarified butter) at intervals to increase its flavour, while being continuously fanned. It is typically eaten with green coriander and tamarind chutney served with onion rings and lemon, or used in preparing an authentic chicken tikka masala.[3] A chicken tikka sizzler is a dish where chicken tikka is served on a heated plate with onions. The dish is also popular in Afghanistan, though the Afghan variant (like many other Persian, Turkish, and Arab dishes) is less spicy compared to the variants in the Indian subcontinent and uses beef and lamb in addition to chicken.[4][5] Hot",
    "Chicken Tikka Masala": " Chicken tikka masala is a dish consisting of roasted marinated chicken chunks (chicken tikka) in a spiced sauce. The sauce is usually creamy and orange-coloured. The dish was created by cooks from South Asia living in Great Britain and is offered at restaurants around the world. Chicken tikka masala is composed of chicken tikka, boneless chunks of chicken marinated in spices and yogurt that are roasted in an oven, served in a creamy sauce.[1][2] A tomato and coriander sauce is common, but no recipe for chicken tikka masala is standard; a survey found that of 48 different recipes, the only common ingredient was chicken.[3][4] The sauce usually includes tomatoes (frequently as pur\u00e9e), cream, coconut cream and a masala spice mix. The sauce and chicken pieces may be coloured orange using foodstuffs such as turmeric, paprika, tomato pur\u00e9e or with food dye. Chicken tikka masala is similar to butter chicken, both in the method of creation and appearance.[5] The origin of the dish is not certain, but many sources attribute it to the South Asian community in Great Britain; some sources cite Glasgow as the city of origin.[2][6][7][8] Chicken tikka masala may derive from butter chicken, a popular dish in the northern Indian subcontinent. The Multicultural Handbook of Food, Nutrition and Dietetics credits its creation to Bangladeshi migrant chefs in Britain in the 1960s. They developed and served a number of new inauthentic \"Indian\" dishes, including chicken tikka masala.[9] Historians of ethnic food Peter and Colleen Grove discuss multiple claims regarding the origin of chicken tikka masala, concluding that the dish \"was most certainly invented in Britain, probably by a Bangladeshi chef.\"[10] They suggest that \"the shape of things to come may have been a recipe for Shahi Chicken Masala in Mrs Balbir Singh\u2019s Indian Cookery published in 1961.\"[10] Another claim is that it originated in a restaurant in Glasgow, Scotland.[11][1] This version recounts how a British Pakistani chef, Ali Ahmed Aslam, proprietor of a restaurant in Glasgow, invented chicken tikka masala by improvising a sauce made from a tin of condensed tomato soup, and spices.[12][13][7] Peter Grove challenged any claim that Aslam was the creator of the dish on grounds that the dish was known to exist several years before his restaurant opened.[14] Chef Anita Jaisinghani, a correspondent in the Houston Chronicle, wrote that \"the most likely story is that the modern version was created during the early \u201970s by an enterprising Indian chef near London\" who used Campbell's tomato soup.[15] However, restaurant owner Iqbal Wahhab claims that he and Peter Grove fabricated the story of a chef using tomato soup to create chicken tikka masala  in order \"to entertain journalists\".[16][17][18] Rahul Verma, a food critic who writes for The Hindu,[19] claimed that the dish has its origins in the Punjab region.[20][11] Chicken tikka masala is served in restaurants around the world.[21][22] According to a 2012 survey of 2,000 people in Britain, it was the country's second-most popular foreign dish to cook, after Chinese stir fry.[23] In 2001, British Foreign Secretary Robin Cook mentioned the dish in a speech acclaiming the benefits of Britain's multiculturalism, declaring: Chicken tikka masala is now a true British national dish, not only because it is the most popular, but because it is a perfect illustration of the way Britain absorbs and adapts external influences. Chicken tikka is an Indian dish. The masala sauce was added to satisfy the desire of British people to have their meat served in gravy.[24][25][16][26] Hot",

    "Chocolate Cake": " Chocolate cake or chocolate g\u00e2teau (from French: g\u00e2teau au chocolat) is a cake flavored with melted chocolate, cocoa powder, or both. It can also have other ingredients such as fudge, vanilla creme, and other sweeteners.[1] The history of chocolate cake goes back to the 17th century, when cocoa powder from the Americas was added to traditional cake recipes.[2] In 1828, Coenraad van Houten of the Netherlands developed a mechanical method for extracting the fat from cacao liquor, resulting in cacao butter and the partly defatted cacao, a compacted mass of solids that could be sold as \"rock cacao\" or ground into powder.[3] The processes transformed chocolate from an exclusive luxury to an inexpensive daily snack.[3] A process for making silkier and smoother chocolate, called conching, was developed in Switzerland in 1879 by Rodolphe Lindt. This made it easier to bake with chocolate, as it amalgamates smoothly and completely with cake batters.[3] Until the 1890s, chocolate recipes were mostly for chocolate drinks,[3] and its presence in cakes was only in fillings and glazes.[4] In 1886, American cooks began adding chocolate to the cake batter to make the first chocolate cakes in that country.[4] The Duff Company of Pittsburgh, a molasses manufacturer, introduced \"Devil's food\" chocolate cake mixes in the mid-1930s, but production was put on hold during World War II. After the war, the Pilsbury company was in 1948 the first to sell a chocolate cake mix,[5] and in 1951 the \"Three Star Surprise\" mix from Duncan Hines (so called because a white, yellow or chocolate cake could be made from the same mix)[6] swept the market.[5][7] \"Chocolate decadence\" cakes were popular in the United States 1980s. In the 1990s, single-serving molten chocolate cakes with liquid chocolate centers and infused chocolates with exotic flavors such as tea, curry, red pepper, passion fruit, and champagne were popular. Chocolate lounges and artisanal chocolate makers were popular in the 2000s.[8] Rich, all-but-flourless chocolate cakes are \"now standard in the modern p\u00e2tisserie\", according to Maricel Presilla's The New Taste of Chocolate in 2001.[3] Popular variants on chocolate cake include:",

    "Country Captain": "Country captain is a curried chicken and rice dish, which is popular in the Southern United States. It was introduced to the United States through Charleston, Savannah, New York City, and Philadelphia, but has origins in the Indian subcontinent. The dish was also included in the U.S. military's Meal, Ready-to-Eat packs from 2000 to 2004, in honor of it being a favorite dish of George S. Patton. It has also appeared on television shows in both the United States and in the United Kingdom, with chefs Bobby Flay, Atul Kochhar and Cyrus Todiwala all cooking the dish. Todiwala served his version to Queen Elizabeth II as part of her Diamond Jubilee celebrations. In its basic form, country captain is a mild stew made with browned chicken pieces, onions, and curry powder.[1] Almonds and golden raisins or zante currants are usually added.[2] Many versions also call for tomatoes, garlic, and bell peppers.[3] The dish is served over white rice.[1] With the exception of the rice, it is meant to be cooked all in the same pot.[2] Chef Mamrej Khan has referred to the dish as one of the first fusion dishes to be developed, making it part of the Anglo-Indian cuisine.[4] Country captain originated in India as a simple spatchcock poultry or game recipe involving onions and curry and possibly enjoyed by British officers.[4][5] One theory is that an early 19th-century British sea captain, possibly from the East India Company,[6] working in the spice trade introduced it to the American South via the port of Savannah. The dish remains popular amongst the communities in Mumbai, India.[4] The \"country\" part of the dish's name dates from when the term referred to things of Indian origin instead of British, and so the term \"country captain\" would have meant a captain of Indian origin, a trader along the coasts of India.[5] Others claim that the word \"captain\" in the title is simply a corruption of the word \"capon\".[7] In 1991, The New York Times columnist Molly O'Neill researched the origin of the dish known as country captain,[8] which had been a steady feature in southern cookbooks since the 1950s. Working with Cecily Brownstone, they discovered that the dish originally published in the United States in the pages of Miss Leslie\u2019s New Cookery Book published in Philadelphia in 1857.[9] The recipe required a \"fine full-grown fowl\".[10] It also appeared in the kitchens of  Alessandro Filippini, who was a chef with a restaurant on Wall Street in the 19th century.[9] Fans of the dish have included Franklin D. Roosevelt, who encountered country captain while visiting the Little White House in Warm Springs, Georgia.[11] Roosevelt introduced it to George S. Patton, and it was Patton's love for the dish which subsequently resulted in it being added in his honor to the U.S. Army's Meal, Ready-to-Eat field rations in 2000.[9] A variety of Southern chefs have recipes for the dish, including Paul Prudhomme,[12] Paula Deen and Emeril Lagasse.[2][13] The dish was featured on an episode of Throwdown! with Bobby Flay in season 6 guest-starring Matt and Ted Lee.[14] It also appeared on the BBC One cooking show, Saturday Kitchen, with chef Atul Kochhar cooking the regular chicken and rice version of the dish.[1] Chef Cyrus Todiwala cooked a variation of country captain on Saturday Kitchen. His version was similar to shepherd's pie, in that the meat was baked under a layer of potato.[15] He had previously cooked the dish for Queen Elizabeth II and the Duke of Edinburgh at Krishna Avanti Primary School in Harrow as part of the Queen's Diamond Jubilee celebrations in 2012. That version of the dish used a rare breed of lamb from the Orkney Islands which had been fed on seaweed.[16] The dish is also now on the menu of Todiwala's London restaurant, Caf\u00e9 Spice Namast\u00e9.[17]",
    "Crab Curry": "  Crabs are decapod crustaceans of the infraorder Brachyura (meaning \"short tail\" in Greek), which typically have a very short projecting tail-like abdomen, usually hidden entirely under the thorax.[a] They live in all the world's oceans, in freshwater, and on land, are generally covered with a thick exoskeleton, and have a single pair of pincers on each arm. They first appeared during the Jurassic period, around 200 million years ago. Crabs are generally covered with a thick exoskeleton, composed primarily of highly mineralized chitin.[4][5] Behind their pair of chelae (claws) are six walking legs and then two swimming legs. The crab breathes through gills on its underside; gills must be at least moist to work. Crabs vary in size from the pea crab, a few millimeters wide, to the Japanese spider crab, with a leg span up to 4\u00a0m (13\u00a0ft).[6] Several other groups of crustaceans with similar appearances \u2013 such as king crabs and porcelain crabs \u2013 are not true crabs, but have evolved features similar to true crabs through a process known as carcinisation.[7][8][9][10] Crabs are found in all of the world's oceans, as well as in fresh water and on land, particularly in tropical regions. About 850 species are freshwater crabs.[11] Crabs often show marked sexual dimorphism. Males often have larger claws,[12] a tendency that is particularly pronounced in the fiddler crabs of the genus Uca (Ocypodidae). In fiddler crabs, males have one greatly enlarged claw used for communication, particularly for attracting a mate.[13] Another conspicuous difference is the form of the pleon (abdomen); in most male crabs, this is narrow and triangular in form, while females have a broader, rounded abdomen.[14] This is because female crabs brood fertilised eggs on their pleopods. Crabs attract a mate through chemical (pheromones), visual, acoustic, or vibratory means. Pheromones are used by most fully aquatic crabs, while terrestrial and semiterrestrial crabs often use visual signals, such as fiddler crab males waving their large claws to attract females. The vast number of brachyuran crabs have internal fertilisation and mate belly-to-belly. For many aquatic species, mating takes place just after the female has moulted and is still soft. Females can store the sperm for a long time before using it to fertilise their eggs. When fertilisation has taken place, the eggs are released onto the female's abdomen, below the tail flap, secured with a sticky material. In this location, they are protected during embryonic development. Females carrying eggs are called \"berried\" since the eggs resemble round berries. When development is complete, the female releases the newly hatched larvae into the water, where they are part of the plankton. The release is often timed with the tidal and light/dark diurnal cycle.[15][16] The free-swimming tiny zoea larvae can float and take advantage of water currents. They have a spine, which probably reduces the rate of predation by larger animals. The zoea of most species must find food, but some crabs provide enough yolk in the eggs that the larval stages can continue to live off the yolk. Each species has a particular number of zoeal stages, separated by moults, before they change into a megalopa stage, which resembles an adult crab, except for having the abdomen (tail) sticking out behind. After one more moult, the crab is a juvenile, living on the bottom rather than floating in the water. This last moult, from megalopa to juvenile, is critical, and it must take place in a habitat that is suitable for the juvenile to survive.[17]:\u200a63\u201377 Most species of terrestrial crabs must migrate down to the ocean to release their larvae; in some cases, this entails very extensive migrations. After living for a short time as larvae in the ocean, the juveniles must do this migration in reverse. In many tropical areas with land crabs, these migrations often result in considerable roadkill of migrating crabs.[17]:\u200a113\u2013114 Once crabs have become juveniles, they still have to keep moulting many more times to become adults. They are covered with a hard shell, which would otherwise prevent growth. The moult cycle is coordinated by hormones. When preparing for moult, the old shell is softened and partly eroded away, while the rudimentary beginnings of a new shell form under it. At the time of moulting, the crab takes in a lot of water to expand and crack open the old shell at a line of weakness along the back edge of the carapace. The crab must then extract all of itself \u2013 including its legs, mouthparts, eyestalks, and even the lining of the front and back of the digestive tract \u2013 from the old shell. This is a difficult process that takes many hours, and if a crab gets stuck, it will die. After freeing itself from the old shell (now called an exuvia), the crab is extremely soft and hides until its new shell has hardened. While the new shell is still soft, the crab can expand it to make room for future growth.[17]:\u200a78\u201379 Crabs typically walk sideways[18] (hence the term crabwise), because of the articulation of the legs which makes a sidelong gait more efficient.[19] Some crabs walk forward or backward, including raninids,[20] Libinia emarginata[21] and Mictyris platycheles.[18] Some crabs, like the Portunidae and Matutidae, are also capable of swimming,[22] the Portunidae especially so as their last pair of walking legs are flattened into swimming paddles.[17]:\u200a96 Crabs are mostly active animals with complex behaviour patterns such as communicating by drumming or waving their pincers. Crabs tend to be aggressive toward one another, and males often fight to gain access to females.[23] On rocky seashores, where nearly all caves and crevices are occupied, crabs may also fight over hiding holes.[24] Fiddler crabs (genus Uca) dig burrows in sand or mud, which they use for resting, hiding, and mating, and to defend against intruders.[17]:\u200a28\u201329,\u200a99 Crabs are omnivores, feeding primarily on algae,[25] and taking any other food, including molluscs, worms, other crustaceans, fungi, bacteria, and detritus, depending on their availability and the crab species. For many crabs, a mixed diet of plant and animal matter results in the fastest growth and greatest fitness.[26][27] Some species are more specialised in their diets, based in plankton, clams or fish.[17]:\u200a85 Crabs are known to work together to provide food and protection for their family, and during mating season to find a comfortable spot for the female to release her eggs.[28] Crabs make up 20% of all marine crustaceans caught, farmed, and consumed worldwide, amounting to 1.5\u00a0million tonnes annually. One species, Portunus trituberculatus, accounts for one-fifth of that total. Other commercially important taxa include Portunus pelagicus, several species in the genus Chionoecetes, the blue crab (Callinectes sapidus), Charybdis spp., Cancer pagurus, the Dungeness crab (Metacarcinus magister), and Scylla serrata, each of which yields more than 20,000\u00a0tonnes annually.[29] In some crab species, meat is harvested by manually twisting and pulling off one or both claws and returning the live crab to the water in the knowledge that the crab may survive and regenerate the claws.[30][31][32] Crabs are prepared and eaten as a dish in many different ways all over the world. Some species are eaten whole, including the shell, such as soft-shell crab; with other species, just the claws or legs are eaten. The latter is particularly common for larger crabs, such as the snow crab. In many cultures, the roe of the female crab is also eaten, which usually appears orange or yellow in fertile crabs. This is popular in Southeast Asian cultures, some Mediterranean and Northern European cultures, and on the East, Chesapeake, and Gulf Coasts of the United States. In some regions, spices improve the culinary experience. In Southeast Asia and the Indosphere, masala crab and chilli crab are examples of heavily spiced dishes. In the Chesapeake Bay region, blue crab is often steamed with Old Bay Seasoning. Alaskan king crab or snow crab legs are usually simply boiled and served with garlic or lemon butter. For the British dish dressed crab, the crab meat is extracted and placed inside the hard shell. One American way to prepare crab meat is by extracting it and adding varying amounts of binders, such as egg white, cracker meal, mayonnaise, or mustard, creating a crab cake.  Crabs can also be made into a bisque, a global dish of French origin which in its authentic form includes in the broth the pulverized shells of the shellfish from which it is made. Imitation crab, also called surimi, is made from minced fish meat that is crafted and colored to resemble crab meat. While it is sometimes disdained among some elements of the culinary industry as an unacceptably low-quality substitute for real crab, this does not hinder its popularity, especially as a sushi ingredient in Japan and South Korea, and in home cooking, where cost is often a chief concern.[33] Indeed, surimi is an important source of protein in most East and Southeast Asian cultures, appearing in staple ingredients such as fish balls and fish cake. Whether crustaceans as a whole experience pain or not is a scientific debate that has ethical implications for crab dish preparation. Crabs are very often boiled alive as part of the cooking process. Advocates for Animals, a Scottish animal welfare group, stated in 2005 that \"scientific evidence ... strongly suggests that there is a potential for decapod crustaceans and cephalopods to experience pain and suffering\". This is primarily due to \"The likelihood that decapod crustaceans can feel pain [which] is supported by the fact that they have been shown to have opioid receptors and to respond to opioids (analgesics such as morphine) in a similar way to vertebrates.\"  Similarities between decapod and vertebrate stress systems and behavioral responses to noxious stimuli were given as additional evidence for the capacity of decapods to experience pain.[34] In 2005 a review of the literature by the Norwegian Scientific Committee for Food Safety tentatively concluded that \"it is unlikely that [lobsters] can feel pain,\" though they note that \"there is apparently a paucity of exact knowledge on sentience in crustaceans, and more research is needed.\" This conclusion is based on the lobster's simple nervous system. The report assumes that the violent reaction of lobsters to boiling water is a reflex response (i.e. does not involve conscious perception) to noxious stimuli.[35] The earliest unambiguous crab fossils date from the Early Jurassic, with the oldest being Eocarcinus from the early Pliensbachian of Britain, which likely represents a stem-group lineage, as it lacks several key morphological features that define modern crabs.[37][38] Most Jurassic crabs are only known from dorsal (top half of the body) carapaces, making it difficult to determine their relationships.[39] Crabs radiated in the Late Jurassic, corresponding with an increase in reef habitats, though they would decline at the end of the Jurassic as the result of the decline of reef ecosystems. Crabs increased in diversity through the Cretaceous and represented the dominant group of decapods by the end of the period.[40] The crab infraorder Brachyura belongs to the group Reptantia, which consists of the walking/crawling decapods (lobsters and crabs).  Brachyura is the sister clade to the infraorder Anomura, which contains the hermit crabs and relatives.  The cladogram below shows Brachyura's placement within the larger order Decapoda, from analysis by Wolfe et al., 2019.[41]  Dendrobranchiata (prawns) Stenopodidea (boxer shrimp) Procarididea Caridea (\"true\" shrimp) Achelata (spiny lobsters and slipper lobsters) Polychelida (benthic crustaceans) Astacidea (lobsters and crayfish) Axiidea (mud shrimp, ghost shrimp, and burrowing shrimp) Gebiidea (mud lobsters and mud shrimp) Anomura (hermit crabs and allies) Brachyura (\"true\" crabs)  Brachyura is separated into several sections, with the basal Dromiacea diverging the earliest in the evolutionary history, around the Late Triassic or Early Jurassic.  The group consisting of Raninoida and Cyclodorippoida split off next, during the Jurassic period.  The remaining clade Eubrachyura then divided during the Cretaceous period into Heterotremata and Thoracotremata.\nA summary of the high-level internal relationships within Brachyura can be shown in the cladogram below:\n[42]\n[41] Dromiacea Raninoida Cyclodorippoida Heterotremata Thoracotremata There is a no consensus on the relationships of the subsequent superfamilies and families.  The proposed cladogram below is from analysis by Tsang et al, 2014:[42] Dromiidae (may be paraphyletic) Dynomenidae Homolidae (paraphyletic) Latreilliidae Raninidae Cyclodorippidae Cymonomidae Potamonautidae Potamidae Gecarcinucidae Pseudothelphusidae  Trichodactylidae (freshwater crabs) Orithyiidae Belliidae Chasmocarcinidae Retroplumidae Ethusidae Dorippidae Leucosiidae Inachidae Epialtidae (paraphyletic) Majidae / Mithracidae Corystidae Euryplacidae Matutidae Calappidae Parthenopidae Cancridae Carpiliidae Aethridae Pseudocarcinus of Menippidae Menippe of Menippidae Polybiidae Portunidae Tanaochelidae Galenidae Pilumnidae Mathildellidae Eriphiidae Oziidae Vultocinidae Trapeziidae Goneplacidae Scalopidiidae Xanthidae (paraphyletic) Panopeidae Pinnotheridae Dotillidae Percnidae Xenograpsidae Cryptochiridae Ocypodidae Glyptograpsidae Grapsidae Plagusiidae Gecarcinidae Sesarmidae Mictyridae Varunidae Macrophthalmidae The infraorder Brachyura contains approximately 7,000 species in 98 families,[42][22] as many as the remainder of the Decapoda.[43] The evolution of crabs is characterized by an increasingly robust body, and a reduction in the abdomen. Although many other groups have undergone similar processes, carcinisation is most advanced in crabs. The telson is no longer functional in crabs, and the uropods are absent, having probably evolved into small devices for holding the reduced abdomen tight against the sternum. In most decapods, the gonopores (sexual openings) are found on the legs. Since crabs use their first two pairs of pleopods (abdominal appendages) for sperm transfer, this arrangement has changed. As the male abdomen evolved into a slimmer shape, the gonopores have moved toward the midline, away from the legs, and onto the sternum.[44] A similar change occurred, independently, with the female gonopores. The movement of the female gonopore to the sternum defines the clade Eubrachyura, and the later change in the position of the male gonopore defines the Thoracotremata. It is still a subject of debate whether a monophyletic group is formed by those crabs where the female, but not male, gonopores are situated on the sternum.[43] Numbers of extant and extinct (\u2020) species are given in brackets.[1] The superfamily Eocarcinoidea, containing Eocarcinus and Platykotta, was formerly thought to contain the oldest crabs; it is now considered part of the Anomura.[45] Recent studies have found the following superfamilies and families to not be monophyletic, but rather paraphyletic or polyphyletic:[42][41][48][47] Both the constellation Cancer and the astrological sign Cancer are named after the crab, and depicted as a crab. William Parsons, 3rd Earl of Rosse drew the Crab Nebula in 1848 and noticed its similarity to the animal; the Crab Pulsar lies at the centre of the nebula.[49] The Moche people of ancient Peru worshipped nature, especially the sea,[50] and often depicted crabs in their art.[51] In Greek mythology, Karkinos was a crab that came to the aid of the Lernaean Hydra as it battled Heracles. One of Rudyard Kipling's Just So Stories, The Crab that Played with the Sea, tells the story of a gigantic crab who made the waters of the sea go up and down, like the tides.[52]  The auction for the crab quota in 2019, Russia is the largest revenue auction in the world except the spectrum auctions.[citation needed] In Malay mythology (as related by Hugh Clifford to Walter William Skeat), ocean tides are believed to be caused by water rushing in and out of a hole in the Navel of the Seas (Pusat Tasek), where \"there sits a gigantic crab which twice a day gets out in order to search for food\".[53]:\u200a7\u20138 The Kapsiki people of North Cameroon use the way crabs handle objects for divination.[citation needed] The term crab mentality is derived from a type of detrimental social behavior observed in crabs.

    "Creams": " Cream is a dairy product composed of the higher-fat layer skimmed from the top of milk before homogenization. In un-homogenized milk, the fat, which is less dense, eventually rises to the top. In the industrial production of cream, this process is accelerated by using centrifuges called \"separators\". In many countries, it is sold in several grades depending on the total butterfat content. It can be dried to a powder for shipment to distant markets, and contains high levels of saturated fat.[1][2] Cream skimmed from milk may be called \"sweet cream\" to distinguish it from cream skimmed from whey, a by-product of cheese-making. Whey cream has a lower fat content and tastes more salty, tangy, and \"cheesy\".[3] In many countries partially fermented cream is also sold: sour cream, cr\u00e8me fra\u00eeche, and so on.  Both forms have many culinary uses in both sweet and savoury dishes. Cream produced by cattle (particularly Jersey cattle) grazing on natural pasture often contains some carotenoid pigments derived from the plants they eat; traces of these intensely colored pigments give milk a slightly yellow tone, hence the name of the yellowish-white color: cream. Carotenoids are also the origin of butter's yellow color. Cream from goat's milk, water buffalo milk, or from cows fed indoors on grain or grain-based pellets, is white.[4] Cream is used as an ingredient in many foods, including ice cream, many sauces, soups, stews, puddings, and some custard bases, and is also used for cakes. Whipped cream is served as a topping on ice cream sundaes, milkshakes, lassi, eggnog, sweet pies, strawberries, blueberries, or peaches. Cream is also used in Indian curries such as masala dishes. Cream (usually light/single cream or half and half) may be added to coffee. Both single and double cream (see Types for definitions) can be used in cooking. Double cream or full-fat cr\u00e8me fra\u00eeche is often used when the cream is added to a hot sauce, to prevent it separating or \"splitting\". Double cream can be thinned with milk to make an approximation of single cream. The French word cr\u00e8me denotes not only dairy cream but also other thick liquids such as sweet and savory custards, which are normally made with milk, not cream.[5] Different grades of cream are distinguished by their fat content, whether they have been heat-treated, whipped, and so on. In many jurisdictions, there are regulations for each type. The Australia New Zealand Food Standards Code \u2013 Standard 2.5.2 \u2013 Defines cream as a milk product comparatively rich in fat, in the form of an emulsion of fat-in-skim milk, which can be obtained by separation from milk. Cream sold without further specification must contain no less than 350 g/kg (35%) milk fat.[6] Manufacturers labels may distinguish between different fat contents, a general guideline is as follows: Canadian cream definitions are similar to those used in the United States, except for \"light cream\", which is very low-fat cream, usually with 5 or 6 percent butterfat.[8] Specific product characteristics are generally uniform throughout Canada, but names vary by both geographic and linguistic area and by manufacturer: \"coffee cream\" may be 10 or 18 percent cream and \"half-and-half\" (cr\u00e8me l\u00e9g\u00e8re) may be 3, 5, 6 or 10 percent, all depending on location and brand.[9][10] Regulations allow cream to contain acidity regulators and stabilizers. For whipping cream, allowed additives include skim milk powder (\u2264 0.25%), glucose solids (\u2264 0.1%), calcium sulphate (\u2264 0.005%), and xanthan gum (\u2264 0.02%).[11] The content of milk fat in canned cream must be displayed as a percentage followed by \"milk fat\", \"B.F\", or \"M.F\".[12] In France, the use of the term \"cream\" for food products is defined by the decree 80-313 of April 23, 1980.[13] It specifies the minimum rate of milk fat (12%) as well as the rules for pasteurisation or UHT sterilisation. The mention \"cr\u00e8me fra\u00eeche\" (fresh cream) can only be used for pasteurised creams conditioned on production site within 24h after pasteurisation. Even if food additives complying with French and European laws are allowed, usually, none will be found in plain \"cr\u00e8mes\" and \"cr\u00e8mes fra\u00eeches\" apart from lactic ferments (some low cost creams (or close to creams) can contain thickening agents, but rarely).[citation needed] Fat content is commonly shown as \"XX% M.G.\" (\"mati\u00e8re grasse\"). (usually 30%) (usually 15%) (usually 30%) (usually 15%) Russia, as well as other EAC countries, legally separates cream into two classes: normal (10\u201334% butterfat) and heavy (35\u201358%),[14] but the industry has pretty much standardized around the following types: In Sweden, cream is usually sold as: Mellangr\u00e4dde (27%) is, nowadays, a less common variant. \nGr\u00e4ddfil (usually 12%) and Creme Fraiche (usually around 35%) are two common sour cream products. In Switzerland, the types of cream are legally defined[17] as follows: Sour cream and cr\u00e8me fra\u00eeche (German: Sauerrahm, Cr\u00e8me fra\u00eeche; French: cr\u00e8me acidul\u00e9e, cr\u00e8me fra\u00eeche; Italian: panna acidula, cr\u00e8me fra\u00eeche) are defined as cream soured by bacterial cultures. Thick cream (German: verdickter Rahm; French: cr\u00e8me \u00e9paissie; Italian: panna addensata) is defined as cream thickened using thickening agents. In the United Kingdom, these types of cream are produced.[19] Fat content must meet the Food Labelling Regulations 1996.[20] In the United States, cream is usually sold as: Not all grades are defined by all jurisdictions, and the exact fat content ranges vary. The above figures, except for \"manufacturer's cream\", are based on the Code of Federal Regulations, Title 21, Part 131.[21][22] Cream may have thickening agents and stabilizers added. Thickeners include sodium alginate, carrageenan, gelatine, sodium bicarbonate, tetrasodium pyrophosphate, and alginic acid.[23]:\u200a296\u200a[24] Other processing may be carried out. For example, cream has a tendency to produce oily globules (called \"feathering\") when added to coffee. The stability of the cream may be increased by increasing the non-fat solids content, which can be done by partial demineralisation and addition of sodium caseinate, although this is expensive.[23]:\u200a297 Butter is made by churning cream to separate the butterfat and buttermilk. This can be done by hand or by machine. Whipped cream is made by whisking or mixing air into cream with more than 30% fat, to turn the liquid cream into a soft solid. Nitrous oxide, from whipped-cream chargers may also be used to make whipped cream. Sour cream, produced in many countries, is cream (12 to 16% or more milk fat) that has been subjected to a bacterial culture that produces lactic acid (0.5%+), which sours and thickens it. Cr\u00e8me fra\u00eeche (28% milk fat) is slightly soured with bacterial culture, but not as sour or as thick as sour cream. Mexican crema (or cream espesa) is similar to cr\u00e8me fra\u00eeche. Smetana is a heavy cream-derived (15\u201340% milk fat) Central and Eastern European sweet or sour cream. Rjome or r\u00f8mme is Norwegian sour cream containing 35% milk fat, similar to Icelandic s\u00fdr\u00f0ur rj\u00f3mi. Clotted cream in the United Kingdom is made through a process that starts by slowly heating whole milk to produce a very high-fat (55%) product, similar to Indian malai. Reduced cream is a cream product in New Zealand, often used to make Kiwi dip. Some non-edible substances are called creams due to their consistency: shoe cream is runny, unlike regular waxy shoe polish;  hand/body \"creme\" or \"skin cream\" is meant for moisturizing the skin. Regulations in many jurisdictions restrict the use of the word cream for foods. Words such as creme, kreme, creame, or whipped topping (e.g., Cool Whip) are often used for products which cannot legally be called cream, though in some jurisdictions even these spellings may be disallowed, for example under the doctrine of idem sonans.[25][26] Oreo and Hydrox cookies are a type of sandwich cookie in which two biscuits have a soft, sweet filling between them that is called \"cr\u00e8me filling.\" In some cases, foods can be described as cream although they do not contain predominantly milk fats; for example, in Britain, \"ice cream\" can contain non-milk fat (declared on the label) in addition to or instead of cream, and salad cream is the customary name for a non-dairy condiment that has been produced since the 1920s.[27] In other languages, cognates of \"cream\" are also sometimes used for non-food products, such as fogkr\u00e9m (Hungarian for toothpaste), or Sonnencreme (German for sunscreen). Some products are described as \"cream alternatives\". For example, Elmlea Double, etc. are blends of buttermilk or lentils and vegetable oil with other additives sold by Upfield in the United Kingdom packaged and shelved in the same way as cream, labelled as having \"a creamy taste\".[28]",
    "Curry": "This is an accepted version of this page  Curry is an international dish with a sauce or gravy seasoned with spices, mainly derived from the interchange of Indian cuisine with European taste in food, starting with the Portuguese and followed by the Dutch and British. Many dishes that would be described as curries in English are found in the native cuisines of countries in Southeast Asia and East Asia. A first step in the creation of curry was the arrival in India of spicy hot chili peppers, along with other ingredients such as tomatoes and potatoes, part of the Columbian exchange of plants between the Old World and the New World. During the British Raj, Anglo-Indian cuisine developed, leading to Hannah Glasse's 18th century recipe for \"currey the India way\" in England. Curry was then spread in the 19th century by indentured Indian sugar workers to the Carribean, and by British traders to Japan. Further exchanges around the world made curry a fully international dish. Many types of curry exist in different countries. In Southeast Asia, curry often contains a spice paste and coconut milk. In India, the spices are fried in oil or ghee to create a paste; this may be combined with a water-based broth, or sometimes with milk or coconut milk. In China and Korea, curries are based on a commercial curry powder. Curry restaurants outside their native countries often adapt their cuisine to suit local tastes; for instance, Thai restaurants in the West sell red, yellow, and green curries with chili peppers of those colours, often combined with additional spices of the same colours. In Britain, curry has become the national dish, with some types adopted from India, others modified or wholly invented, as with Chicken tikka masala, created by British Bangladeshi restaurants in the 20th century. The word 'curry' does not occur in any Indian language. Various words with similar sounds, like khari and caril, mean \"sauce\" in modern usage, but probably meant both a specific blend of spices, and a dish using that blend, when the Portuguese arrived in Goa. The scholar of food culture Lizzie Collingham suggests that the Portuguese heard and adopted the word, resulting eventually in its modern meaning of a dish, often spiced, in a sauce or gravy.[1] Collingham writes that:[2] No Indian, however, would have referred to his or her food as a curry. The idea of curry as a particular dish does not exist in India. Indians referred to their different dishes by specific names. But the British lumped all these together under the heading of curry.[2] 'Curry' is \"ultimately derived\"[3] from some combination of Dravidian words of south Indian languages.[3] One of those words is the Tamil ka\u1e5fi (\u0b95\u0bb1\u0bbf) meaning 'sauce' or 'relish for rice'.[3][4][5] Other Dravidian languages, namely Malayalam, Kannada and Kodava have similar words.[6] Ka\u1e5fi is described in a mid-17th century Portuguese cookbook by members of the British East India Company,[7] who were trading with Tamil merchants along the Coromandel Coast of southeast India, becoming known as a \"spice blend ... called kari podi or curry powder\".[8] The first appearance in its anglicised form (spelt currey) was in Hannah Glasse's 1747 book The Art of Cookery Made Plain and Easy.[3][7] The term \"curry\" is not derived from the name of the curry tree, although some curries do include curry leaves among many other spices.[9][10] It is not related, either, to the word cury in The Forme of Cury,[7] a 1390s English cookbook;[11] that term comes from the Middle French word cuire, meaning 'to cook'.[3] Austronesian merchants in South East Asia traded spices along marine trade routes between South Asia (primarily the ports on the south eastern coast of India and Sri Lanka) and East Asia as far back at 5000 BCE.[12][13][14] Archaeological evidence dating to 2600 BCE from Mohenjo-daro suggests the use of mortar and pestle to pound spices including mustard, fennel, cumin, and tamarind pods with which they flavoured food.[15] Black pepper is native to the Indian subcontinent and Southeast Asia and has been known to Indian cooking since at least 2000 BCE.[16] The three basic ingredients of the spicy stew were ginger, garlic, and turmeric. Using starch grain analysis, archaeologists identified the residue of these spices in both skeletons and pottery shards from excavations in India, finding that turmeric and ginger were present.[17][18] Sauces in India before Columbus could contain black pepper or long pepper to provide a little heat, but not chili, so they were not spicy hot by modern standards.[19] The establishment of the Mughal Empire, in the early 16th century, influenced some curries, especially in the north. Another influence was the establishment of the Portuguese trading centre in Goa in 1510, resulting in the introduction of chili pepper, tomatoes and potatoes to India from the Americas, as a byproduct of the Columbian Exchange.[20] In 1598, an English translation of a Dutch book about travel in the East Indies mentioned a \"somewhat sour\" broth called Carriel, eaten with rice.[24] The later Dutch word karie was used in the Dutch East Indies from the 19th century; many Indians had by then migrated to Southeast Asia.[24] Curry was introduced to English cuisine from Anglo-Indian cooking in the 17th century, as spicy sauces were added to plain boiled and cooked meats.[25] That cuisine was created in the British Raj when British wives or memsahibs instructed Indian cooks on the food they wanted, transforming many dishes in the process.[26] Curry was first served in coffee houses in Britain from 1809.[27] During the 19th century, curry was carried to the Caribbean by Indian indentured workers in the British sugar industry.[21][24] Since the mid-20th century, curries of many national styles have become popular far from their origins, and increasingly become part of international fusion cuisine.[21] Alan Davidson writes that curry's worldwide extension is a result of the Indian diaspora and globalisation, starting within the British Empire, and followed by economic migrants who brought Indian cuisine to many countries.[24] In 1886, \u5496\u55b1 (G\u0101l\u00ed) (Chinese pronunciation of \"curry\") appeared among the Chinese in Singapore.[23] Malay Chinese people then most likely brought curry to China.[24] In India, spices are always freshly prepared for use in sauces.[28] Derived from such mixtures (but not containing curry leaves[29]), curry powder is a ready-prepared spice blend first sold by Indian merchants to European colonial traders. This was commercially available from the late 18th century,[30][31] with brands such as Crosse & Blackwell and Sharwood's persisting to the present.[32] British traders introduced the powder to Meiji era Japan, in the mid-19th century, where it became known as Japanese curry.[22] There are many varieties of curry. The choice of spices for each dish in traditional cuisine depends on regional cultural traditions and personal preferences.[33] Such dishes have names that refer to their ingredients, spicing, and cooking methods.[2] Outside the Indian subcontinent, a curry is a dish from Southeast Asia which uses coconut milk and spice pastes, and is commonly eaten over rice.[34] Curries may contain fish, meat, poultry, or shellfish, either alone or in combination with vegetables. Others are vegetarian. A masala mixture is a combination of dried or dry-roasted spices commonly homemade for some curries.[33] Dry curries are cooked using small amounts of liquid, which is allowed to evaporate, leaving the other ingredients coated with the spice mixture. Wet curries contain significant amounts of sauce or gravy based on broth, coconut cream or coconut milk, dairy cream or yogurt, or legume pur\u00e9e, saut\u00e9ed crushed onion, or tomato pur\u00e9e.[33] Curry powder, a commercially prepared mixture of spices marketed in the West, was first exported to Britain in the 18th century when Indian merchants sold a concoction of spices, similar to garam masala, to the British East India Company returning to Britain.[33] Curry is very popular in the United Kingdom, with a curry house in nearly every town.[36][37] Such is its popularity that it has frequently been called its \"adopted national dish\".[38] It was estimated that in 2016 there were 12,000 curry houses, employing 100,000 people and with annual combined sales of approximately \u00a34.2\u00a0billion.[39] The food offered is cooked to British taste, but with increasing demand for authentic Indian styles.[40] Chicken tikka masala was described by the British Foreign Secretary Robin Cook as \"a true British national dish, not only because it is the most popular, but because it is a perfect illustration of the way Britain absorbs and adapts external influences.\"[41] Its origin is not certain, but many sources attribute it to British Asians; some cite Glasgow as the city of origin.[42][43][44] It may derive from butter chicken, popular in the north of India.[45] Curries in Britain are derived partly from India and partly from invention in local Indian restaurants. They vary from mildly-spiced to extremely hot, with names that are to an extent standardised across the country, but are often unknown in India.[35] Many Indian dishes are spicy. The spices chosen for a dish are freshly ground and then fried in hot oil or ghee to create a paste.[46] \nThe content of the dish and style of preparation vary by region.[47] The sauces are made with spices including black pepper, cardamom, chili peppers, cinnamon, cloves, coriander, cumin, fennel seed, mustard seed, and turmeric.[47] As many as 15 spices may be used for a meat curry.[47] The spices are sometimes fried whole, sometimes roasted, sometimes ground and mixed into a paste.[47] The sauces are eaten with steamed rice or idli rice cakes in south India,[47] and breads such as chapatis, roti, and naan in the north.[48] \nThe popular rogan josh, for example, from Kashmiri cuisine, is a wet dish of lamb with a red gravy coloured by Kashmiri chillies and an extract of the red flowers of the cockscomb plant (mawal).[49] Rice and curry is the staple dish of Sri Lanka.[50] Japanese curry is usually eaten as kar\u0113 raisu \u2013 curry, rice, and often pickled vegetables, served on the same plate and eaten with a spoon, a common lunchtime canteen dish. It is less spicy and seasoned than Indian and Southeast Asian curries, being more of a thick stew than a curry. British people brought curry from the Indian colony back to Britain[51] and introduced it to Japan during the Meiji period (1868 to 1912), after Japan ended its policy of national self-isolation (sakoku), and curry in Japan was categorised as a Western dish.[52] Its spread across the country is attributed to its use in the Japanese Army and Navy which adopted it extensively as convenient field and naval canteen cooking, allowing even conscripts from the remotest countryside to experience the dish. The Japan Maritime Self-Defense Force traditionally have curry every Friday for lunch and many ships have their own recipes.[53] The standard Japanese curry contains onions, carrots, potatoes, and sometimes celery, and a meat that is cooked in a large pot. Sometimes grated apples or honey are added for additional sweetness and other vegetables are sometimes used instead.[54] Curry spread to other regions of Asia. Curry powder is added to some dishes in the southern part of China. The curry powder sold in Chinese grocery stores is similar to Madras curry powder, but with the addition of star anise and cinnamon.[55] The former Portuguese colony of Macau has its own culinary traditions and curry dishes, including Galinha \u00e0 portuguesa (\"Portuguese-style chicken\") and curry crab. Portuguese sauce is a sauce flavoured with curry and thickened with coconut milk.[56] Curry was popularized in Korean cuisine when Ottogi entered the Korean food industry with an imported curry powder in 1969.[57][58] Korean curry powder contains spices including cardamom, chili, cinnamon, and turmeric.[59]\nCurry tteokbokki is made of tteok (rice cakes), eomuk (fish cakes), eggs, vegetables, and gochujang, fermented red chili paste. As in India, chilis were brought to Korea by European traders. Spicy chili sauce then replaced the soy sauce formerly used in tteokbokki.[60] In Burmese cuisine, curries are broadly called hin. Burmese curries contains meat simmered in a curry paste containing onion, garlic, shrimp paste, tomato, and turmeric. Burmese curries are often mild, without chili, and somewhat oily.[61][62] Thai curries are called kaeng, and usually consist of meat, fish or vegetables in a sauce based on a paste made from chilies, onions or shallots, garlic, and shrimp paste.[63] A few stir-fried Thai dishes use phong kari, an Indian style curry powder.[64] In the West, Thai curries are often colour-coded green, yellow, and red, with green usually the mildest, red the hottest. Green curry is flavoured with green chili, coriander, kaffir lime, and basil; yellow, with yellow chili and turmeric; and red, with red chili.[65] Malaysian Indian cuisine may have initially incorporated curries via the region's Indian population,[66] but it has become a staple among the Malay and Chinese populations there. Malaysian curries have many varieties, but are often flavoured with cumin, cinnamon, turmeric, coconut milk, shallots, chili peppers, and garlic.[67] Indian Indonesian cuisine consists of adaptations of authentic dishes from India, as well as original creations inspired by the diverse food culture of Indonesia. Curry in Indonesian is kari and in Javanese, kare. In Indonesian cuisine especially in Bandung, there is a dish called lontong kari, a combined of lontong and beef yellow curry soup.[68] In Javanese cuisine, kare rajungan, blue swimmer crab curry has become a delicacy of Tuban Regency, East Java.[69] Rendang, the national dish of Indonesia, originally from Minang, is drier and contains mostly meat and more coconut milk than a conventional Malaysian curry; it was mentioned in Malay literature in the 1550s by Hikayat Amir Hamzah.[70] In Vietnamese cuisine, influenced by both Thai and Indian cooking, curry is known as c\u00e0 ri. It is made with coconut milk, Madras curry powder with plenty of turmeric, and a variety of fresh ingredients such as coriander, lemongrass, and ginger.[71] In the Philippines, two kinds of curry traditions are seen corresponding with the cultural divide between the Hispanicised north and Indianised/Islamised south. In the northern areas, a linear range of new curry recipes could be seen. The most common is a variant of the native ginataang manok (chicken cooked in coconut milk) dish with the addition of curry powder, known as the \"Filipino chicken curry\". This is the usual curry dish that northern Filipinos are familiar with. Similarly, other northern Filipino dishes that can be considered \"curries\" are usually ginataan (cooked with coconut milk) variants of other native meat or seafood dishes such as adobo, kaldereta, and mechado, that simply add curry powder or non-native Indian spices.[72] Curry spread to South Africa with the migration of people from the Indian subcontinent to the region in the colonial era. African curries, Cape Malay curries and Natal curries include the traditional Natal curry, the Durban curry, Bunny chow, and roti rolls. South African curries appear to have been created in both KwaZulu-Natal and the Western Cape, while others developed across the country over the late 20th and early 21st centuries to include ekasi, coloured, and Afrikaner varieties.[73] Durban has the largest population of Indians outside of India in the world.[74] Bunny chow or a \"set\", a South African standard, consists of either lamb, chicken or bean curry poured into a tunnelled-out loaf of bread to be eaten with one's fingers by dipping pieces of the bread into it.[73][74]",
    "Churma": " Churma is a popular Rajasthani, Bihari,[1] Uttar Pradesi, Haryanvi,  and Awadhi delicacy from India.[2][3] In Punjab, the dish is called churi.[4][5] It is coarsely ground wheat, crushed and cooked with ghee and sugar.[6] In Haryana, churma is made by mashing up roti in ghee and jaggery. It is not served with ghee, especially as a diet for the wrestlers sparring in the dangal of akharas.[7] It is usually served either with a tall glass of warm milk, lassi, or with sour kadhi. In Rajasthan, churma is made in lots of variations. It is made by mashing up roti made of either bajra (see pearl millet) or 'gehu' (see wheat) with Desi ghee and sugar ( shakkar / khand / bura / kasar ) or jaggery pieces. It is commonly eaten with kadhi, dahl/dal and topped with ghee. 'Dade ka Churma' often called 'Rajasthani Churma', is a special kind of churma that is native to Rajasthan. It is made by sifting wheat flour, suji (see semolina ) and besan. They are kneaded into a dough adding melted ghee and milk. Small 'lois' (dough balls) are made, and fried till golden brown. After the lois cool down, they are ground to a coarse powdery texture. Following this, powdered sugar, cardamom and dry fruits are mixed in. It is a popular companion to the dish dal baati[6] and is eaten often at social events/celebrations and served with dahl.  This Indian cuisine\u2013related article is a stub.

    "Dahi Vada": " Dahi vada or Dahi Bada is a type of chaat (snack) originating from the Indian subcontinent.[1] It is prepared by soaking vadas (fried lentil balls) in thick dahi (yogurt).[2] Dahi vada is also known as \"dahi vade\" (\u0926\u0939\u0940 \u0935\u0921\u0947) in Marathi, dahi barey/dahi balley (\u062f\u06c1\u06cc \u0628\u06be\u0644\u06d2/\u062f\u06c1\u06cc \u0628\u0691\u06d2) in Urdu, dahi vada (\u0926\u0939\u0940 \u0935\u0921\u093c\u093e) in Hindi, dahi bhalla (\u062f\u06c1\u06cc \u0628\u06be\u0644\u0627/\u0a26\u0a39\u0a40 \u0a2d\u0a71\u0a32\u0a3e) in Punjabi, thayir vadai in Tamil,[3] thairu vada in Malayalam, perugu vada in Telugu, mosaru vade in Kannada, dahi bara (\u0b26\u0b39\u0b3f \u0b2c\u0b30\u0b3e) in Odia and doi bora (\u09a6\u0987 \u09ac\u09a1\u09bc\u09be) in Bengali. A recipe for dahi wada (as kshiravata) is mentioned in Manasollasa, a 12th-century Sanskrit encyclopedia compiled by Someshvara III, who ruled from present-day Karnataka.[4][5] Today, dahi vada is prepared on festival such as Holi.[5][6] Washed urad lentils are soaked overnight and ground into a batter for the vada, then cooked in hot oil.[7] The hot deep-fried vadas are first put in water and then transferred to thick beaten yogurt. The vadas are soaked for a period of time before serving.[7] Additions to the batter may also include golden raisins. Vadas may be topped with coriander or mint leaves, chilli powder, crushed black pepper, chaat masala, cumin, shredded coconut, green chilies, boondi, thinly sliced fresh ginger, or pomegranate. Sweeter curd is preferred in some places in India, especially in Maharashtra and Gujarat, although the garnishing remains the same. A combination of coriander and tamarind chutney is often used as a garnish.[7] The batter can be made using chickpea flour too.[8][9] Dahi vada as popular street chaat is found in various cities across India, including Chennai, Bangaluru, Delhi, Mumbai, Jaipur, Kolkata, Cuttack, and Indore. Dahi baray are also found in Pakistan, especially in Karachi.[10][11][12][13]",
    "Dal": " In Indian cuisine, dal (also spelled daal or dhal [1] pronunciation: [d\u032aa\u02d0l]), pappu, or paruppu are dried, split pulses (e.g., lentils, peas, and beans) that do not require soaking before cooking. India is the largest producer of pulses in the world.[2] The term is also used for various soups prepared from these pulses. These pulses are among the most important staple foods in South Asian countries, and form an important part of the cuisines of the Indian subcontinent.[3] The word d\u0101l (dal) derives from the Sanskrit verbal root dal- \"to split\",[4][5] which is inherited from Proto-Indo-European *delh\u2081- \"to split, divide\".[6][7][8] Lentils are among the most ancient cultivated foods; they have been found in human settlements dating back to the Bronze Age.[9] Researchers have dated the preparation and cooking of split dal as far back as 800-300 BC.[10] Dal as a staple food has been mentioned in many ancient religious texts native to the Indian subcontinent, including the Yajurveda and the Mahayana Buddhist La\u1e45k\u0101vat\u0101ra S\u016btra: May for me strength, righteousness, milk, sap, ghee, honey, eating and drinking in company, ploughing, rain, conquest, victory, wealth, riches, prosperity, prospering, plenteousness, lordship, much, more, fun, fuller, imperishableness, bad crops, food, freedom from hunger, rice, barley, beans, sesame, kidney beans, vetches, wheat, lentils, millet, Panicum miliaceum, Panicum frumentaceum, and wild rice (prosper through the sacrifice). Now, Mah\u0101mati, the food I have permitted [my disciples to take] is gratifying to all wise people but is avoided by the unwise; it is productive of many merits, it keeps away many evils; and it has been prescribed by the ancient Rishis. It comprises rice, barley, wheat, kidney beans, beans, lentils, etc., [...] food prepared with these is proper food. Dal are often prepared in three different forms: The hulling of a pulse is intended to improve digestibility and palatability. It also affects the nutrition provided by the dish, significantly increasing protein and reducing dietary fibre content.[16] Pulses with their outer hulls intact are also quite popular in the Indian subcontinent as the main cuisine. Over 50 different varieties of pulses are known in the Indian subcontinent.[citation needed] Dal is frequently eaten with flatbreads, such as rotis or chapatis, or with rice. The latter combination is called dal bhat in Nepali, Gujarati, and various other Indian languages. In addition, certain types of dal are fried, salted, and eaten as a dry snack, and a variety of savory snacks are made by frying a paste made from soaked and ground dals in different combinations, to which other ingredients, such as spices and nuts (commonly cashews) may be added. Dal preparations are eaten with rice, chapati and naan on the Indian subcontinent. The manner in which it is cooked and presented varies by region. In South India, dal is often called \"paruppu\". It is primarily used to make a dish called sambar. It is also used to make parippu that is mixed with charu and rice. Ground chana dal is used to make a paste called besan, which is used in the preparation of many dishes including bhaji[17] and Mediterranean dishes like farinata. Most dal recipes are quite simple to prepare. The standard preparation begins with boiling a variety of dal (or a mix) in water with some turmeric, salt to taste, and then adding a fried garnish at the end of the cooking process.[18] In some recipes, tomatoes, kokum, unripe mango, jaggery, or other ingredients are added while cooking the dal, often to impart a sweet-sour flavour. The fried garnish for dal goes by many names, including chaunk, tadka/tarka, bagar, fodni, and phoran. The ingredients in the chaunk for each variety of dal vary by region and individual tastes. The raw spices (more commonly cumin seeds, mustard seeds, asafoetida, and sometimes fenugreek seeds and dried red chili pepper) are first fried for a few seconds in the hot oil on medium/low heat. This is generally followed by ginger, garlic, and onion, which are generally fried for 10 minutes. After the onion turns golden brown, ground spices (turmeric, coriander, red chili powder, garam masala, etc.) are added. The chaunk is then poured over the cooked dal. As the main ingredient of dal is the pulse used, it gains much of its nutritional properties from the pulse. Note: All nutrient values including protein are in %DV per 100 grams of the food item.

    "Dalcha": " Dalcha, is an Indian lentil-based stew originating from Hyderabad, Telangana, India. Its origins may lie with a similar middle eastern dish Harees which is more of a gruel with cooked meats. Primary ingredients are lentils, can be chana dal or sometimes tur dal. Vegetables or meats, both chicken or mutton may also be added to the stew, so if mutton is added it will be called a mutton dalcha. Bottle gourd is another key ingredient in a Dalcha. It is traditionally served with the rice dish called bagara khana.

    "Dhokla": "Dhokla is a savoury sponge dish that is native to the Indian state of Gujarat and parts of adjacent states,[1] and is popular throughout the country. It is made with a fermented batter that is steamed to a cake-like consistency. The batter consists of a mixture of rice with the pulse Bengal gram,[2] but has several variants with the gram replaced by chickpeas, pigeon peas, or urad beans.[3][4] Dukkia, a pulse-based precursor of dhokla, is mentioned in a Jain text dated to 1066 CE. The earliest extant work to mention the word \"dhokla\" is the Gujarati Varanaka Samuchaya (1520 CE).[5] Dried rice and split chickpeas (chana dal) are soaked overnight. The mixture is ground, and the paste is fermented for at least four hours. Spices are added, such as chili pepper, coriander, and ginger. The fermented batter is then steamed for about 15 minutes and cut into pieces. These chopped pieces are seasoned in sauteed mustard seeds or cumin seeds, green chilis and curry leaves. Dhokla is usually served with deep fried chillies and coriander chutney and garnished with fresh coriander and/or grated coconut.[6] Popular variants of dhokla include: Khaman is similar but made from chickpea flour without rice. It is generally lighter in colour and softer than dhokla. hot & cold",
    "Doner Kebab": " Doner kebab (UK: /\u02c8d\u0252n\u0259r k\u026a\u02c8b\u00e6b/, US: /\u02c8do\u028an\u0259r k\u026a\u02c8b\u0251\u02d0b/; Turkish: d\u00f6ner or d\u00f6ner kebap, pronounced [d\u0153\u02c8n\u00e6\u027e ke\u02c8b\u0251p]), also spelled as d\u00f6ner kebab, is a dish of Turkish origin made of meat cooked on a vertical rotisserie.[1] Seasoned meat stacked in the shape of an inverted cone is turned slowly on the rotisserie, next to a vertical cooking element. The operator uses a knife to slice thin shavings from the outer layer of the meat as it cooks. The vertical rotisserie was invented in the 19th-century Ottoman Empire, and dishes such as the Arab shawarma, Greek gyros, Canadian donair, and Mexican al pastor are derived from this.[2][3][4] The modern sandwich variant of d\u00f6ner kebab originated and was popularized in 1970s West Berlin by Turkish immigrants.[5][6][7] This was recognized by the Berlin-based Association of Turkish Doner Manufacturers in Europe in 2011.[8] The sliced meat of a doner kebab may be served on a plate with various accompaniments, stuffed into a pita or other type of bread as a sandwich, or wrapped in a thin flatbread such as lavash or filo, known as a d\u00fcr\u00fcm (literally meaning roll or wrap in Turkish). Kadir Nurman in the early 1970s introduced the sandwich or wrap form, which has become popular around the world as a fast food dish sold by kebab shops, and is often called simply a \"kebab\".[9] The sandwich generally contains salad or vegetables, which may include tomato, lettuce, cabbage, onion with sumac, fresh or pickled cucumber, or chili, and various types of sauces.[10][11] In the Ottoman Empire, at least as far back as the 17th century, stacks of seasoned sliced meat were cooked on a horizontal rotisserie, similar to the ca\u011f kebab.[12] The vertical rotisserie was introduced no later than the mid-19th century.[12][2][13] The town of Bursa, in modern-day Turkey, is often considered the birthplace of the vertically roasted d\u00f6ner kebab.[14] According to Yavuz \u0130skendero\u011flu, his grandfather \u0130skender Efendi as a child in 1850s Bursa had the idea of roasting the lamb at his father's restaurant vertically rather than horizontally; it was a success, and some years later became known as d\u00f6ner kebap.[15] [non-primary source needed] However, he may have been preceded by Hamdi Usta from Kastamonu around 1830.[16][17][18] A version popular in the Arab world became known as shawarma. By at least the 1930s it had been brought overseas, and was sold in restaurants in Mexico by Lebanese immigrants.[3] Doner kebab likely arrived in Greece in the 1920s with the population exchange between Greece and Turkey, later transforming into gyros.[19] It was not until a century after its invention that d\u00f6ner kebab was introduced and popularized in Istanbul, most famously by Beyti G\u00fcler. His restaurant, first opened in 1945, was soon discovered by journalists and began serving d\u00f6ner and other kebab dishes to kings, prime ministers, film stars and celebrities.[20] It has been sold in sandwich form in Istanbul since at least the mid-1960s.[18] The d\u00f6ner kebab and its derivatives served in a sandwich form as \"fast food\" came to worldwide prominence in the mid to late 20th century. The first doner kebab shop in London opened in 1966[21] and they were a familiar sight in provincial cities by the late 1970s, while gyros was already popular in Greece and New York City in 1971.[22][23] A Greek-Canadian variation, the donair, was introduced in 1972, eventually becoming the official food of Halifax, and spreading across the country.[24][25] By the 1960s, the taco al pastor in Mexico had evolved from the shawarma.[3] In Germany, the d\u00f6ner kebab was popularized by Turkish guest workers in Berlin in the early 1970s.[26] The dish developed there from its original form into a distinctive style of sandwich with abundant salad, vegetables, and sauces, sold in large portions at affordable prices, that would soon become one of the top-selling fast food and street food dishes in Germany and much of Europe, and popular around the world.[27] In the English name \"doner kebab\", the word doner is borrowed from the Turkish d\u00f6ner kebap, with the Turkish letter \u00f6 usually anglicized as \"o\",[28] though \"d\u00f6ner kebab\" is an alternative spelling in English.[29] The word \"kebab\" is used, which comes to English from the Arabic: \u0643\u064e\u0628\u064e\u0627\u0628 (kab\u0101b), partly through Urdu, Persian and Turkish; it may refer to a number of different kebab dishes made with roasted or grilled meat. While kebab has been used in English since the late 17th century, doner/d\u00f6ner kebab is known only from the mid-20th or later.[29] The Turkish word d\u00f6ner comes from d\u00f6nmek (\"to turn\" or \"to rotate\"), so the Turkish name d\u00f6ner kebap literally means \"rotating roast\".[30] In German, it is spelled D\u00f6ner Kebab; the sandwich is often called ein D\u00f6ner. Particularly in British English, a d\u00f6ner kebab sandwich may be referred to simply as \"a kebab\".[31] A Canadian variation is \"donair\". In Greek, it was originally called d\u00f6ner (Greek: \u03bd\u03c4\u03bf\u03bd\u03ad\u03c1) but later came to be known as gyros, from \u03b3\u03cd\u03c1\u03bf\u03c2 (\"turn\"), a calque of the Turkish name.[32] The Arabic name \u0634\u0627\u0648\u0631\u0645\u0627 (sh\u0101warm\u0101) derives from another Turkish word, \u00e7evirme, also meaning \"turning\". Persians refer to it as \"kebab torki\".[33] There are many variations of d\u00f6ner in Turkey: In Azerbaijan, d\u00f6ner kebab (Azerbaijani: d\u00f6n\u0259r), served similarly to the European style of sandwich wrapped in lava\u015f (flatbread) or in \u00e7\u00f6r\u04d9k (bread, including tandoor bread), is one of the most widespread fast foods. It is usually made with \u04d9t (meat, essentially lamb or mutton), but sometimes toyuq (chicken).[39][40][41] In Japan, d\u00f6ner kebabs are now common, especially in Tokyo. They are predominantly made of chicken but occasionally beef, and called simply \"kebab\". The toppings include shredded lettuce or cabbage, sliced tomato, and usually a choice of sauces such as Thousand Islands, spicy, and garlic.[42] D\u00f6ner kebab is increasingly becoming popular in Vietnam, mostly because of Vietnamese who used to live in Germany and introduced it to their homeland. Throughout Hanoi and Ho Chi Minh City many d\u00f6ner kebab stalls can be found. B\u00e1nh m\u1ef3 D\u00f6ner Kebab, the Vietnamese version of the d\u00f6ner kebab, has some fundamental differences with the original d\u00f6ner kebab. First of all, pork is used instead of beef and lamb. Second, the meat is topped with sour vegetables and chili sauce.[43][44] D\u00f6ner kebab shops can be found in all cities across Austria. Kebabs (often referred to as \"D\u00f6ner\") outsell burgers or the traditional W\u00fcrstel (sausage).[45] In Belgium, the first d\u00f6ner kebabs were already served in the 1970s, brought by immigrants to the country. In the mining region, mainly beef or variants with pieces of chicken was used for the D\u00f6ner kebab. D\u00f6ner kebabs with mutton and lamb were more likely to be found in other regions of Belgium.[citation needed] In Finland, d\u00f6ner kebabs gained popularity after the 90s, when Turkish and other Middle-Eastern immigrants started to arrive in the country in considerable numbers, opening restaurants and importing their traditional dishes. Kebabs are generally seen as fast food, often served by late-night pizzerias.[46] Turkish immigrants also brought doner kebab to France, where it became especially popular with the country's large North African population, in the 1980s.[47] A typical kebab consists of bread stuffed with d\u00f6ner meat shavings, lettuce, sliced tomato and onions, with a choice of sauce including sauce blanche, a mayo-yogurt sauce. Kebabs are usually served with french fries, often stuffed into the bread itself. In Paris, this variation is called Sandwich grec (\"Greek sandwich\").[48][49] Doner kebab is the third most popular fast food in France, next to hamburgers and pizza, with more than 10,000 kebab shops selling about 300 million a year.[47] In Germany, the earliest claim to the introduction of Turkish d\u00f6ner kebab dates to 1969, when Bursa native Nevzat Salim and his father started to sell Iskender Kebap in Reutlingen.[50] However, the Association of Turkish D\u00f6ner Producers in Europe (ATDID) connects the wide popularization of the dish to the stand of Turkish guest worker Kadir Nurman at West Berlin's Zoo Station in 1972, which helped establish the d\u00f6ner kebab sandwich as a fast food option.[50][26] While the claims of multiple persons to have \"invented\" the d\u00f6ner may be hard to prove,[51] the further development of modern d\u00f6ner sandwich is connected to the city of Berlin.[52] The d\u00f6ner kebap as it was first served in Berlin contained only meat, onions and a bit of salad.[53] Over time, it developed into a dish with abundant salad, vegetables, and a selection of sauces to choose from. Even orders placed in the Turkish language in Berlin will ask for the hot sauce using the German word \"scharf\", flagging the hybrid nature of the Berlin style of d\u00f6ner kebap.[54]:\u200a58\u200a This variation served with pita bread has influenced the style of d\u00f6ner kebap in Germany and in other nations. A 2007 survey showed that many people consider the d\u00f6ner kebab to be the most characteristic food of Berlin.[54]:\u200a54 Annual sales of d\u00f6ner kebabs in Germany amounted to \u20ac2.5\u00a0billion in 2010.[55] Beef or veal, and chicken, are widely used instead of the more expensive lamb. Turkey (Truthahn) and vegetarian versions have become increasingly popular.[56] Tarkan Ta\u015fyumruk, president of the Association of Turkish D\u00f6ner Producers in Europe (ATDID), provided information in 2010 that, every day, more than 400 tonnes of d\u00f6ner kebab meat is produced in Germany by around 350 firms. At the same ATDID fair, Ta\u015fyumruk stated that, \"Annual sales in Germany amount to \u20ac2.5\u00a0billion. That shows we are one of the biggest fast-foods in Germany.\" In many cities throughout Germany, d\u00f6ner kebabs are at least as popular as hamburgers or sausages, especially with young people.[55] In 2011 there were over 16,000 establishments selling d\u00f6ner kebabs in Germany, with yearly sales of \u20ac3.5\u00a0billion.[57] Kapsalon is a Dutch food item consisting of French fries topped with d\u00f6ner or shawarma meat, garlic sauce, and a layer of Gouda cheese, baked or broiled until melted, and then subsequently covered with a layer of dressed salad greens and more sauce. The dish is usually served as fast food in a disposable metal tray. The term kapsalon means \"hairdressing salon\" or \"barbershop\" in Dutch, alluding to hairdresser Nathaniel Gomes who originated the dish when he requested his local kebab shop in Rotterdam to prepare it for him.[58] Introduced by Turkish immigrants, the d\u00f6ner kebab with salad and sauce is a very popular dish in the United Kingdom, especially after a night out.[51] The meat is sometimes sold on its own, but more commonly with chips (fries), in naan bread or in pita bread. German Doner Kebab is a Glasgow-based chain operating 100 restaurants in the UK, which specialises in the dish.[59] A variation known as donair was introduced in Halifax, Nova Scotia, in the early 1970s.[24] There are competing claims about the origin, but according to Halifax resident Leo Gamoulakos, his father, Greek immigrant Peter Gamoulakos, started selling Greek-style gyros at Velos Pizza in the Halifax suburb of Bedford. It did not catch on with the public, so in 1972[24] he modified the customary pork and lamb recipe by using spiced ground beef, Lebanese flatbread, and inventing the distinctive sweet donair sauce made with condensed milk, vinegar, sugar, and garlic. He called it by the doner name rather than gyros, but it came to be pronounced, and spelled, as donair.[60][61][62] In 1973 Gamoulakos opened the first King of Donair restaurant on Quinpool Road in Halifax.[63] In 2015, Halifax named donair the city's official food.[25] Historically found only in Atlantic Canada, the dish's popularity has expanded to other parts of Canada in various forms.[64][60] Al pastor is a variation of d\u00f6ner kebab via Lebanese shawarma. Literally \"in the style of the shepherd\", it references the lamb often used in shawarma, though it is normally made with pork.[65] Doner kebab is best known in the United States in its Greek variation, now known as gyros. Numerous people have made competing claims to have introduced the dish sometime in the 1960s, and its mass-production in the 1970s.[66] Originally known in Greece as \u03bd\u03c4\u03bf\u03bd\u03ad\u03c1 (doner), by 1970 in the United States the newly coined name gyros was commonly in use,[67][68] though it was still known in some Greek restaurants by both names into the 1970s.[69][23] It was also available, possibly later, in some Turkish restaurants.[70][71][72] In recent years a number of restaurants and food trucks specializing in d\u00f6ner kebab have opened in various parts of the country; a substantial percentage are owned by German immigrants.[73][74] With a multicultural population, the doner kebab in Australia competes with the Greek gyros and the Lebanese shawarma.[75] Kebab sellers are subject to strict government food safety regulations.[76] A halal snack pack is a dish that originated in Australia. It consists of halal-certified doner kebab meat, chips (french fries), and sauces such as chili, garlic and barbecue. It is traditionally served in a styrofoam container, and has been described as a staple dish of takeaway kebab shops in Australia.[77][78] The name of the dish was selected by the Macquarie Dictionary as the \"People's choice Word of the Year\" for 2016.[79] Health concerns regarding d\u00f6ner kebab, including the hygiene involved in overnight storage and re-heating of partially cooked meat, its quality, as well as high salt, fat, and calorie levels, have been reported in the media.[80][81][82] Some investigations have found poor-quality ingredients in d\u00f6ner kebab meat, or meat types other than what was advertised.[83][84] Food safety regulations in most developed countries address the dangers of bacteria in undercooked meat of all kinds sold to the public. Some have guidelines specific to d\u00f6ner kebab handling and preparation. Following several outbreaks of E. coli food poisoning, the Canadian government in 2008 introduced a number of recommendations, including that the meat should be cooked a second time after being sliced from the rotisserie.[85] In Germany, any d\u00f6ner kebab meat placed onto the rotisserie must be sold the same day. It is a violation of health regulations to freeze partially cooked meat for sale at a later date.[86] Hot",
    "Dum Biryani": "This is an accepted version of this page   Biryani (/b\u025c\u02d0r\u02c8j\u0251\u02d0ni/) is a mixed rice dish, mainly popular in South Asia. It is made with rice, some type of meat (chicken, goat, lamb, beef, prawn, or fish) and spices. To cater to vegetarians, in some cases, it is prepared by substituting vegetables or paneer for the meat.[1] Sometimes eggs or potatoes are also added.[2] Biryani is one of the most popular dishes in South Asia and among the South Asian diaspora, although the dish is often associated with the region's Muslim population in particular.[3] Similar dishes are also prepared in other parts of the world such as in  Iran, Iraq, Myanmar, Thailand, and Malaysia.[4] Biryani is the single most-ordered dish on Indian online food ordering and delivery services, and has been labelled as the most popular dish overall in India.[3][5] One theory states that it originated from birinj (Persian: \u0628\u0631\u0646\u062c), the Persian word for rice.[6][7] Another theory states that it is derived from biryan or beriyan (Persian: \u0628\u0631\u06cc\u0627\u0646), which means \"to fry\" or \"to roast\".[8][9] It may alternatively be related to the Persian word bereshtan (Persian: \u0628\u0631\u0634\u062a\u0646) which also means \"to roast (onions)\", as the dish is often prepared by flavouring rice with fried onions and meat, besides mild spices. The exact origin of the dish is uncertain, however, it is speculated to have originated in Persia, (now Iran) or South Asia. In North India, different varieties of biryani developed.[6][10] According to the historian Lizzie Collingham, the modern biryani developed in the royal kitchens of the Mughal Empire (1526\u20131857) and is a mix of the native spicy rice dishes of South Asia and the Persian polao.[11] Indian restaurateur Kris Dhillon believes that the dish originated in Persia and was brought to South Asia by the Mughals.[12] Salma Hossein, whom the BBC regards as the \"doyenne of Islamic cooking in India\", shares a similar view, asserting that biryani came to South Asia from Persia even before the Mughal era. Food scholar Pushpesh Pant also challenges the Mughal-origin claim, stating that it originated in Iran and that \"there is no evidence that biryani first came to this land with the Mughals. It is far more probable that it travelled with pilgrims and soldier-statesmen of noble descent to the Deccan region in South India\".[13] Another theory claims that the dish was prepared in South Asia before the first Mughal emperor Babur conquered India.[14] The 16th-century Mughal text Ain-i-Akbari makes no distinction between biryanis and pilaf (or pulao): it states that the word \"biryani\" is of older usage in India.[citation needed][15] A similar theory, that biryani came to India with Timur's invasion, appears to be incorrect because there is no record of biryani having existed in his native land during that period.[14] According to Pratibha Karan, who wrote the book Biryani, biryani is of Mughal origin, derived from pilaf varieties brought to the South Asian subcontinent by Arab and Persian traders. She speculates that the pulao was an army dish in medieval India. Armies would prepare a one-pot dish of rice with any available red meat. Over time, the dish became biryani due to different methods of cooking, with the distinction between \"pulao\" and \"biryani\" being arbitrary.[6][14] According to Vishwanath Shenoy, the owner of a biryani restaurant chain in India, one branch of biryani comes from the Mughals, while another was brought by the Arab traders to Malabar in South India.[16] There are various apocryphal stories dating the invention to Shah Jahan's time but Rana Safvi, the distinguished historian, says she could only find a recipe from the later Mughal period, from Bahadur Shah Zafar's time. It is not her claim that there was no biryani before that; just that she has not found a recipe. Other historians who have gone through texts say that the first references to biryani only appear around the 18th century.[17] Some claim that the dish \"oonchoru\" as mentioned in Sangam literature, which dates from between 200 BCE and 200 CE, is a predecessor of modern biryani. This dish, which was served to the soldiers of the Chera kings in Kerala, was said to be made of rice, ghee, meat, turmeric, coriander, pepper, and bay leaf.[18][19][20] The spices used in the preparation of South Indian biryanis, such as those used in the Malabar variety, are distinctive to the region and the Western Ghats. These spices are not found in the Middle East, Persia, or North India, underscoring the unique culinary heritage and local ingredients of South Indian biryani.[18][19][20] In South India, where rice is more widely used as a staple food, several distinct varieties of biryani emerged from Hyderabad in Telangana, Vijayawada in Andhra Pradesh, Mangalore and Bhatkal in Coastal Karnataka, Thalassery and Kozhikode in Malabar Kerala, as well as Ambur and Chettinad in Tamil Nadu.[6][10] Pilaf or pulao, as it is known on the Indian subcontinent, is another mixed rice dish popular in the cuisines of the Indian subcontinent, Central Asia, and Middle Eastern cuisine. Opinions differ on the differences between pulao and biryani, and whether actually there is a difference between the two.[21] According to Delhi-based historian Sohail Hashmi, pulao tends to be plainer than biryani, and consists of meat or vegetables cooked with rice with the bottom layered with potatoes or onions. Biryani contains more gravy (or yakhni), and is often cooked longer, leaving the meat (and vegetables, if present) more tender, and the rice more flavoured. Biryani is also cooked with additional dressings and often would have a light layer of scorched rice at the bottom.[22] Author Pratibha Karan states that while the terms are often applied arbitrarily, the main distinction is that a biryani consists of two layers of rice with a layer of meat (and vegetables, if present) in the middle, while the pulao is not layered.[14] Author Colleen Taylor Sen lists the following distinctions between biryani and pulao:[23] Ingredients for biryani vary according to the region and the type of meat and vegetables used. Meat (chicken, goat, beef, lamb,[26] prawn or fish) is the prime ingredient with rice. As is common in dishes of South Asia, vegetables are sometimes also used when preparing biryani. Corn may be used, depending on the season and availability. Navratan biryani tends to use sweeter, richer ingredients such as cashews, sultanas (kishmish), and fruits such as apples and pineapples.[22] The spices and condiments used in biryani may include fennel seeds, ghee (clarified butter), nutmeg, mace,[27] pepper, cloves,[27] cardamom, cinnamon, bay leaves, coriander, mint, ginger, onions, tomatoes, green chilies,[26] star anise, and garlic. The premium varieties include saffron.[27] Some commercial recipes for Biryani also include aromatic essences such as Mitha Ittar see attar, kewra and rose water. Dried sour prunes (Alu Bukhara) may also be added to the biryani. In nasi briyani and other variants made in Southeast Asian countries such as Malaysia, Singapore, and Indonesia, typical Southeast Asian spices and aromatics such as pandan leaf may be used alongside typical South Asian spices.[28] The main ingredient that usually accompanies the spices is chicken, lamb or goat meat; special varieties might use beef or seafood instead. The dish may be served with dahi chutney or raita, seekh kebab, Qorma, curry, a sour dish of aubergine (brinjal), boiled egg, and salad. Biryani can be cooked using one of two styles/techniques, pakki (\"cooked\") and kacchi (\"raw\").[29] There are many types of biryani, whose names are often based on their region of origin. For example, Sindhi biryani developed in the Sindh region of what is now Pakistan, and Hyderabadi biryani developed in the city of Hyderabad in South India. Some have taken the name of the shop that sells it, for example: Haji Biriyani, Haji Nanna Biriyani in Old Dhaka,[30] Fakhruddin Biriyani in Dhaka,[31][32] Students biryani in Karachi, Lucky biryani in Bandra, Mumbai and Baghdadi biryani in Colaba, Mumbai.[22] Biryanis are often specific to the Muslim communities where they originate; they are usually the defining dishes of those communities.[33] Ambur/Vaniyambadi biryani is a variety cooked in the neighboring towns of Ambur and Vaniyambadi in the Tirupattur district of the northeastern part of Tamil Nadu, which has a high Muslim population. It was introduced during the Nawabs of Arcot who once ruled the area. It is typically made with jeera samba rice.[34] Nowadays, it is popular as Ambur or Vaniyambadi style biryani as those are two prominent towns along the popular Bangalore to Chennai highway where travellers stop for eating.[35] The Ambur/Vaniyambadi biryani is accompanied by dhalcha, a sour brinjal curry, and pachadi or raitha (sliced onions mixed with plain yogurt, tomato, chilies, and salt). It has a distinctive aroma and is considered light on the stomach.[citation needed] The usage of spice is moderate, and curd is used as a gravy base. It also has a higher ratio of meat to rice.[15] Ambur-style biriyani is popular as street food all across South India. This is an integral part of the Navayath cuisine and a specialty of Bhatkal, a coastal town in Karnataka. Its origins are traced to the Persian traders who introduced biryani along with kababs and Indian breads. In Bhatkali biryani, the meat is cooked in an onion and green chili-based masala and layered with fragrant rice. It has a unique spicy and heady flavour, and the rice is overwhelmingly white with mild streaks of orange. Its variations include beef, goat, chicken, titar (Partridge), egg, fish, crab, prawn, and vegetable biryani. Though similar to those in Thalassery, this biryani differs with lingering after-notes of mashed onions laced with garlic[citation needed]. A few chilies and spices littered with curry leaves lends a unique flavour to Bhatkal biryani. No oil is used.[36] Bohri biryani, prepared by the Bohris is flavoured with lots of tomatoes.[16] It is popular in Karachi. Chettinad biryani is famous in the Indian state of Tamil Nadu. It is made of jeeraka samba rice, and smells of spices and ghee. It is best taken with nenju elumbu kuzhambu, a spicy and tangy goat meat gravy [citation needed]. The podi kozhi is usually topped with fried onions and curry leaves.[37][38][39][40] Degh ki biryani is a typical biryani made from small cubes of beef or mutton. This biryani originated in Ahmadnagar Sultanate and is famous in Parbhani in Marathwada region and generally served at weddings. The meat is flavoured with ginger, garlic, red chili, cumin, garam masala, fried onion and curd. This biryani is also known as kachay gosht ki biryani or dum biryani, where the meat is marinated and cooked along with short-grained and fine rice. It is left on a slow fire or dum for a fragrant and aromatic flavour. The Delhi version of biryani developed a unique local flavour as the Mughal kings shifted their political capital to the North Indian city of Delhi. Until the 1950s, most people cooked biryani in their home and rarely ate at eateries outside of their homes. Hence, restaurants primarily catered to travellers and merchants. Any region that saw more of these two classes of people nurtured more restaurants, and thus their own versions of biryani. This is the reason why most shops that sold biryani in Delhi, tended to be near mosques such as Jama Masjid (for travellers) or traditional shopping districts (such as Chandni Chowk).[citation needed] Each part of Delhi has its own style of biryani, often based on its original purpose, thus giving rise to Nizamuddin biryani, Shahjahanabad biryani, etc.[citation needed]  Nizamuddin biryani usually had little expensive meat and spices as it was primarily meant to be made in bulk for offering at the Nizamuddin Dargah shrine and thereafter to be distributed to devotees.[22] A non-dum biryani, using many green chillies, popularized by the Babu Shahi Bawarchi shops located outside the National Sports Club in Delhi is informally called Babu Shahi biryani. Another version of Delhi biryani uses achaar (pickles) and is called achaari biryani.[41] The city of Dhaka in Bangladesh used to be the capital of Bengal Subah and is known for Dhakaiya Kacchi Biryani, a Chevon Biryani made with highly seasoned rice and goat meat. The recipe includes: highly seasoned rice, goat meat, mustard oil, garlic, onion, black pepper, saffron, clove, cardamom, cinnamon, salt, lemon, doi, peanuts, cream, raisins and a small amount of cheese (either from cows or buffalo). It is accompanied by borhani, a salted mint drink made of yogurt, coriander, mint and salt. Haji biryani is a favourite among Bangladeshis living abroad.[42] A recipe was handed down by the founder of one Dhaka restaurant to the next generation. Haji Mohammad Shahed claimed, \"I have never changed anything, not even the amount of salt\".[43] Bengali style biryani often includes potatoes. The city of Dindigul in Tamil Nadu is noted for its biryani, which uses a little curd and lemon juice for a tangy taste.[44] Military hotels of Bangalore in Karnataka are known for selling Biryani served in dried leaf bowl called Donne.[45] It is typically made from jeera samba rice, yogurt with lot of common mint and coriander leaves.[46][47] Hyderabadi biryani is India's most famous biryani; some say biryani is synonymous with Hyderabad.[48] Hyderabadi biryani developed in Hyderabad Subah under the rule of Asaf Jah I, who was first appointed as the governor of Deccan by the Mughal Emperor Aurangzeb. It is made with basmati rice, spices and goat meat. Popular variations use chicken instead of goat meat. There are various forms of Hyderabadi biryani, such as kachay gosht ki biryani or dum biryani, where goat meat is marinated and cooked along with the rice. It is left on a slow fire or dum for a fragrant and aromatic flavour.[49] Memoni biryani is an extremely spicy variety developed by the Memons of Gujarat-Sindh region in India and Pakistan.[16] It is made with mutton, dahi, fried onions, and potatoes, and fewer tomatoes compared to Sindhi biryani. Kalyani biryani is a beef biryani from the former state of Hyderabad Deccan.[50] Also known as the \"poor man's\"  Hyderabadi biryani, Kalyani biryani is made from small cubes of buffalo meat or cow meat.[51][52] The meat is flavoured with ginger, garlic, turmeric, red chili, cumin, coriander powder, and lots of onion and tomato. It is first cooked as a thick curry and then cooked along with rice. Then given dum (the Indian method of steaming in a covered pot). It has a distinct tomato, jeera and dhania flavour.[53] Kalyani biryani is supposed to have originated in Bidar during the reign of the Kalyani Nawabs, who migrated to Hyderabad in mid 18th century after one of the Nawabs, Ghazanfur Jang married into the Asaf Jahi family uniting their realms.[citation needed] Kalyani biryani was served by the Kalyani Nawabs to all of their subjects who came from Bidar to Hyderabad and stayed or visited their devdi or noble mansion. Calcutta or Kolkata biryani evolved from Dhakaiya biryani and the Lucknow style biryani when Awadh's last Nawab, Wajid Ali Shah, was exiled in 1856 to the Kolkata suburb of Metiabruz. Shah brought his personal chef with him. Like Dhakaiya biryani, the Kolkata biriyani is characterized by the presence of potato in it.[16] Lucknow was a capital of Awadh Subah. For Lucknow/ avadhi biryani, basmati rice is cooked in ghee with warm, aromatic spices and then layered with a type of meat curry or marinade, sealed, and cooked over low heat until done.[54][55] A specialty of the Beary Muslim community in coastal Karnataka and is also known as Manglorean-style biryani. The dish is made using lots of green chilly and coconut and has the subtle flavor and aroma of fennel. Spices that include nutmeg, mint leaves, fennel seeds, mace (javitri), poppy seeds, almonds, star anise and others. The rice and meat (mutton, chicken, beef) are cooked separately and then layered and slowly cooked together again. This dish is highly served during marriages and other homely occasions. This type of biryani is popular in the Palakkad and Coimbatore regions. This was most commonly prepared by Rowther families in Kerala and Tamil Nadu. This type of biryani is cooked in a different style. Goat meat is most commonly used and it is entirely different from Malabar biryani.[citation needed] The exotic and aromatic Sindhi biryani, originating in the former Mughal subah based in Thatta is known in Pakistan for its spicy taste, fragrant rice, and delicate meat. Sindhi biryani is a beloved staple in food menus of Pakistani and Sindhi cuisine. Sindhi biryani is prepared with meat and a mixture of basmati rice, vegetables, and various spices. Biryani was introduced in the 1900s to Sri Lanka by the Indian Muslims who engaged in trade within the country.[citation needed]  In many cases, Sri Lankan biryani is spicier than most Indian varieties. Side dishes may include Malay pickle, Cashew curry and Mint sambol.[citation needed] Thalassery biryani is the variation of biryani found in the Indian state of Kerala. It is one of the many dishes of the Kerala Muslim community, and very popular.[56] The ingredients are chicken, spices and the specialty is the choice of rice called khyma. Khyma rice is generally mixed with ghee. Although a large number of spices such as mace, cashew nuts, sultana raisins, fennel-cumin seeds, tomato, onion, ginger, garlic, shallot, cloves and cinnamon are used,[57] there is only a small amount of chili (or chili powder) used in its preparation. A pakki biryani, the Thalassery biryani uses a small-grained thin (not round) fragrant variety of rice known as khyma or jeerakasala. The dum method of preparation (sealing the lid with dough [maida] or cloth and placing red-hot charcoal above the lid) is applied here to avoid scorched rice. In Kerala, another variety called beef biryani is well known.[58] In Myanmar (Burma), biryani is known in Burmese as danpauk or danbauk (\u1012\u1036\u1015\u1031\u102b\u1000\u103a), derived from the Persian term dum pukht, which refers to a slow oven cooking technique. Danbauk is a mainstay at festive events such as Thingyan, weddings and donation feasts.[59][60] Given danbauk's South Asian origins, danbauk restaurants and chains have traditionally been owned by Muslims, but in recent decades Buddhist entrepreneurs have entered the market.[59] Featured ingredients include: cashew nuts, yogurt, raisins and peas, chicken, cloves, cinnamon, saffron and bay leaf cooked in long-grain rice.[61] In danbauk, chicken specially seasoned with a danbauk masala spice mix,[62] is cooked with the rice.[63] Danbauk is typically eaten with a number of side dishes, including a fresh salad of sliced onions, julienned cabbage, sliced cucumbers, fermented limes and lemons, fried dried chilies, and soup.[64] In recent decades, danbauk restaurants have innovated variations, including \"ambrosia\" biryani (\u1014\u1010\u103a\u101e\u102f\u1013\u102c\u1011\u1019\u1004\u103a\u1038), which features dried fruits and buttered rice.[64] In Iraq and in the states of the Persian Gulf, biryani (\u0628\u0631\u064a\u0627\u0646\u064a: \"biryani\") is usually saffron-based with chicken usually being the meat or poultry of choice. It is popular throughout Iraq, especially in the Kurdistan Region.  Most variations also include vermicelli, fried onions, fried potato cubes, almonds, and raisins spread liberally over the rice.[16] Sometimes, a sour/spicy tomato sauce is served on the side (maraq). In Iran, during the Safavid dynasty (1501\u20131736), a dish called Beriyan Polo (Nastaliq script: \u0628\u0631\u06cc\u0627\u0646 \u067e\u0644\u0648) was made with lamb or chicken, marinated overnight\u2014with yogurt, herbs, spices, dried fruits like raisins, prunes or pomegranate seeds\u2014and later cooked in a tannour oven, then served with steamed rice.[citation needed] A different dish called biryan is popular in Afghanistan. Biryan traces its origins to the same source as biryani, when most of Afghanistan was part of Kabul and Qandahar Subahs and as today sold in Afghanistan as well as in Bhopal, India. Biryan is prepared by cooking gosht and rice together, but without the additional gravy (yakhni) and other condiments that are used in biryani. The Delhi-based historian Sohail Hashmi refers to the biryan as midway between pulao and biryani.  Afghan biryani tends to use much dry fruit such as raisins and lesser amounts of meat, often cut into tiny pieces.[22] Nasi kebuli is an Indonesian spicy steamed rice dish[65] cooked in goat meat broth, milk and ghee.[66] Nasi kebuli is descended from kabuli palaw which is an Afghani rice dish, similar to biryani served in the Indian subcontinent.[67] Although Indonesia has authentic nasi kebuli, Indonesia also inherited and has local-style of biryani which is known as nasi biryani or nasi briyani. Nasi biryani is popular among and often associated as Acehnese, Arab Indonesian, Indian Indonesian and Malay cuisine.[68] The Malaysian and Singaporean variety of biryani is called nasi briyani or nasi biryani. Although authentic styles of biryani from South India are popular, nasi briyani remains the most popular. The key differences between nasi briyani and Indian biryanis are that the meat in nasi briyani is cooked separately from the rice, and there is more curry, sauce, or gravy present in the nasi briyani than in Indian biryanis.[69] Nasi briyani dishes are very popular in Malaysia and Singapore. As an important part of Malaysian and Singaporean Indian cuisines, they are popularized through mamak stalls, hawker centres, and food courts as well as fine dining restaurants. There are also eateries that sell pork as the main meat of the dish in Singapore.[70][71] Biryani dishes are very popular in Mauritius, especially at Muslim weddings and festivities. It is also widely available at street food places. Mauritian biryanis are often accompanied by an achaar (mango pickles), chilies and salads. Kapampangan cuisine of the Philippines (often in Pampanga) features a special dish called nasing biringyi (chicken saffron rice), that is typically prepared only during special occasions such as weddings, family get-togethers or fiestas. It is not a staple of the Filipino diet as it is difficult to prepare compared to other usual dishes. Nasing biringyi is similar to the nasi briyani dish of Malaysia in style and taste. A version that has merged with the Filipino version of the Spanish paella is known as bringhe.[72] In the Cape Malay culture, a variation of biryani incorporates lentils as a key ingredient in the dish along with meat (usually beef, chicken, seafood or vegetables). The dish is made by cooking the rice and legumes and meat and gravy separately, then mixing it. Uncommonly, it is made using the dum-cooking method. The spices are similar to those used in the original Indian biryani. Variants of biryani exist in the cuisines of Somalia, Kenya, and Tanzania due to centuries of trade between the East African coast and South Asia for centuries, and the more recent migration of Indians to the latter two countries more recently during the British colonial era. Zanzibar has its own form of biryani characterized by the mixture of East African and Indian spices, as well as influences from Arab cuisine. The meat used is most commonly chicken.[73] This variant is similar to the forms of biryani served in Kenya. In Somalia, the descendant of biryani is bariis iskukaris. It is served with chicken, goat, beef, lamb, or camel meat, and spiced with the Somali spice mixture xawaash and other spices. A unique characteristic of bariis and other Somali dishes is the addition of banana on the side to be mixed with the dish. Biryani in Thailand is commonly known as khao mhok (Thai: \u0e02\u0e49\u0e32\u0e27\u0e2b\u0e21\u0e01). It is commonly paired with chicken, beef or even fish and topped with fried garlic. The dish is common in Thai cuisine and is often served with a green sour sauce. Tehari and tehri are various names for the vegetarian adaptation of Biryani but are mainly classified as pulao. It was developed for the Hindu bookkeepers of the Muslim Nawabs. It is prepared by adding potatoes to the rice, as opposed to the case of biryani, where the rice is added to the meat. In Kashmir, tehari is sold as street food. Tehari became more popular during World War II, when meat prices increased substantially and potatoes became the popular substitute in biryani. Hot",
    "Egg Curry": " This is a list of notable egg dishes and beverages. Eggs are laid by females of many different species, including birds, reptiles, amphibians, and fish, and have been eaten by humans for thousands of years.[1] Bird and reptile eggs consist of albumen (egg white) and vitellus (egg yolk), contained within many different thin membranes all surrounded by a protective eggshell. Popular choices for egg consumption are chicken, duck, quail, roe, caviar, and emu. The chicken egg is the egg most often consumed by humans.",
    "Falooda": " Nam maenglak\nAlouda A falooda is a Mughalai cold dessert made with vermicelli.[1][2] It has origins in the Persian dish faloodeh, variants of which are found across West, Central, South and Southeast Asia.[3] Traditionally it is made by mixing rose syrup, vermicelli, and sweet basil seeds with milk, often served with ice cream.[4] The vermicelli used for preparing falooda is made from wheat,[5] arrowroot, cornstarch, or sago.[6] The origin of falooda goes back to Iran (Persia), where a similar dessert, faloodeh, is still popular.[7] The dessert came to late Medieval India with the many Central Asian dynasties that invaded and settled in South Asia in the 16th to 18th century.[7] The present form of falooda was developed in the Mughal Empire and spread with its conquests. The Persianate rulers who succeeded from the Mughals patronized the dessert with their own adaptations, specifically in Hyderabad Deccan and the Carnatic areas of present-day India.[2] This beverage is now a part of Pakistani cuisine, Afghan cuisine, Burmese cuisine, Indian cuisine, Bangladeshi cuisine and Sri Lankan cuisine and is served on weddings and other occasions. In Sri Lanka, Falooda (\u0dc6\u0dbd\u0dd4\u0da9\u0dcf / \u0b83\u0baa\u0bb2\u0bc2\u0b9f\u0bbe) is often consumed as a popular dairy refreshment. In idiomatic Hindustani, faluda is sometimes used as a reference to something that has been shredded, which is an allusion to the vermicelli noodles. For example, someone who falls into disrepute might say that his or her izzat has been turned to faluda (Hindi: \u0907\u091c\u093c\u094d\u091c\u093c\u0924 \u0915\u093e \u092b\u093c\u093e\u0932\u0942\u0926\u093e, Urdu: \u0639\u0632\u062a \u06a9\u0627 \u0641\u0627\u0644\u0648\u062f\u06c1, romanized:\u00a0izzat ka faluda), which is roughly equivalent to saying \"my reputation is shot\".[8] Cold",

    "Fried Rice": "Fried rice is a dish of cooked rice that has been stir-fried in a wok or a frying pan and is usually mixed with other ingredients such as eggs, vegetables, seafood, or meat. It is often eaten by itself or as an accompaniment to another dish. Fried rice is a popular component of East Asian, Southeast Asian and certain South Asian cuisines, as well as a staple national dish of Indonesia. As a homemade dish, fried rice is typically made with ingredients left over from other dishes, leading to countless variations. Fried rice first developed during the Sui dynasty in China.[1] Many varieties of fried rice have their own specific list of ingredients. In China, common varieties include Yangzhou fried rice and Hokkien fried rice. Japanese ch\u0101han is considered a Japanese Chinese dish, having derived from Chinese fried rice dishes. In Southeast Asia, similarly constructed Indonesian, Malaysian, and Singaporean nasi goreng and Thai khao phat and Pineapple fried rice are popular dishes.In the West, most restaurants catering to vegetarians have invented their own varieties of fried rice, including egg fried rice. Fried rice is also seen on the menus of non-Asian countries restaurants offering cuisines with no native tradition of the dish. Additionally, the cuisine of some Latin American countries includes variations on fried rice, including Ecuadorian chaulafan, Peruvian arroz chaufa, Cuban arroz frito, and Puerto Rican arroz mampostea(d)o. Fried rice is a common street food in Asia and other parts of the world. In some Asian countries, small restaurants, street vendors and traveling hawkers specialise in serving fried rice. In Indonesian cities it is common to find fried rice street vendors moving through the streets with their food cart and stationing it in busy streets or residential areas. Many Southeast Asian street food stands offer fried rice with a selection of optional garnishes and side dishes. Cooked rice is the primary ingredient, with myriad additional ingredients, such as vegetables, eggs, meat (chicken, beef, pork, lamb, mutton), preserved meat (bacon, ham, sausage), seafood (fish, shrimp, crab), mushrooms, among others. Aromatics such as onions, shallots, scallions, leeks, ginger and garlic are often added for extra flavor. Various cooking oils, such as vegetable oil, sesame oil, clarified butter, or lard can be used to grease the wok or frying pan to prevent sticking, as well as for flavor. Fried rice dishes can be seasoned with salt, different types of soy sauce, oyster sauce, teriyaki sauce and many other sauces and spices. Popular garnishes include chopped scallions, sliced chili, fried shallots, sprigs of parsley or coriander leaves, mint leaves, sliced boiled eggs, toasted sesame seeds, seaweed flakes (gim or nori), sliced cucumber, tomato, lime, or pickled vegetables. Typically, leftover rice that has been chilled is used rather than freshly cooked rice, as the high moisture content of fresh rice can prevent it from frying properly, leading to an undesirably soft texture. The earliest record of fried rice is in the Sui dynasty (589\u2013618 AD) in China.[2] Fried rice (Thai: \u0e02\u0e49\u0e32\u0e27\u0e1c\u0e31\u0e14, RTGS:\u00a0khao phat, pronounced [k\u02b0\u00e2(\u02d0)w p\u02b0\u00e0t]) in Thailand is typical of central Thai cuisine. In Thai, khao means \"rice\" and phat means \"of or relating to being stir-fried\". This dish differs from Chinese fried rice in that it is prepared with Thai jasmine rice instead of regular long-grain rice. It normally contains meat (chicken, shrimp, pork, and crab are all common), egg, onions, garlic and sometimes tomatoes. The seasonings, which may include soy sauce, sugar, salt, possibly some chili sauce, and the ubiquitous nam pla (fish sauce), are stir-fried together with the other ingredients. The dish is then plated and served with accompaniments like cucumber slices, tomato slices, lime, sprigs of green onion and coriander, and prik nam pla, a spicy sauce made of Thai chili, fish sauce, and chopped garlic. Arroz frito is a denomination used in the Spanish speaking world, meaning \"fried rice\", with adjectives describing the Chinese-inspired varieties, e.g. arroz chino, arroz canton\u00e9s, or local specialties arroz chaufa/chaulaf\u00e1n/chauf\u00e1n/chof\u00e1n, arroz frito tres delicias. An estimated 30,000 people of Chinese origin live in the Dominican Republic. Migration from China began in the second half of the 19th century. Dominican fried rice is known as chof\u00e1n. The dish is made with leftover rice, celery, garlic, bell peppers, red onion, carrots, peas, and soy sauce saut\u00e9ed in vegetable oil. Protein such as ham, chicken, eggs or shrimp can be added. What makes Dominican chof\u00e1n distinct from other fried rice dish is the use of lippia (Jamaican oregano) and bouillon cube. Ghanaian fried rice is one of the more contemporary dishes and can be found in almost every Ghanaian restaurant. It is usually made with Jasmine rice, long grain, or basmati rice. The rice is stir-fried with vegetables(carrots, spring onions, peas, green and red bell peppers), eggs, meats of choice(chicken, beef, shrimp), and spices like chili, curry powder, and salt. The sauces mixed with Ghanaian fried rice are usually soy sauce and chicken broth. Nigerian fried rice is made with long-grain rice, diced fried cow liver (optional) or shrimp, protein (chicken, pork, or shrimp), vegetables (such as carrots, peas, green beans, onions, and chillies), herbs and spices (such as thyme, pepper, and curry powder), and so on. This dish was created by the Yoruba people and spread as a Nigerian staple. Tanzania fried rice is made with long-grain rice, protein (such as beef liver, chicken, or shrimp), vegetables (such as carrots, peas, green beans, onions, and chillies), herbs and spices (such as thyme, pepper, and curry powder), and so on.",
    "Fruitcake": "Fruitcake or fruit cake is a cake made with candied or dried fruit, nuts, and spices, and optionally soaked in spirits. In the United Kingdom, certain rich versions may be iced and decorated. Fruitcakes are usually served in celebration of weddings and Christmas. Given their rich nature, fruitcakes are most often consumed on their own, as opposed to with condiments (such as butter or cream).[1] Fruit cake is different to fruit bread, but may share similar toppings and mixtures. The earliest recipe from ancient Rome lists pomegranate seeds, pine nuts, and raisins that were mixed into barley mash.[2] In the Middle Ages, honey, spices, and preserved fruits were added. Fruitcakes soon proliferated all over Europe. Recipes varied greatly in different countries throughout the ages, depending on the available ingredients as well as (in some instances) church regulations forbidding the use of butter, regarding the observance of Fasting. Pope Innocent VIII (1432\u20131492) finally granted the use of butter, in a written permission known as the \u2018Butter Letter' or Butterbrief in 1490, giving permission to Saxony to use milk and butter in the Stollen fruitcakes.[3] Starting in the 16th century, sugar from the American Colonies (and the discovery that high concentrations of sugar could preserve fruits) created an excess of candied fruit, thus making fruitcakes more affordable and popular.[4] The 17th-century English fruitcake was originally yeast-leavened, and the rum and dried fruit helped extend the shelf life of the cake.[5] In Australia, fruitcake is consumed throughout the year, but most commonly at Christmas, and is available at most major retail outlets. The cake is rarely given icing; often it is consumed with butter or margarine, or custard. In the Bahamas, not only is the fruitcake drenched with rum, but the ingredients are as well. All of the candied fruits, walnuts, and raisins are placed in an enclosed container and are soaked with the darkest variety of rum, anywhere from 2 weeks to 3 months in advance. The cake ingredients are mixed, and once the cake has finished baking, rum is poured onto it while it is still hot. In Bulgaria, the common fruitcake is known as keks (Bulgarian: \u043a\u0435\u043a\u0441 [k\u025bks]), is home-made and is consumed throughout the year. Recipes for keks vary, but commonly it contains flour, butter and/or cooking oil, milk, yeast, yoghurt, eggs, cocoa, walnuts, and raisins. It is usually baked in Bundt-style pans. There is also another specific type of fruitcake prepared for Easter, which is known as kozunak (Bulgarian: \u043a\u043e\u0437\u0443\u043d\u0430\u043a [kozu\u02c8nak]). The fruitcake is commonly eaten during the Christmas season in Canada. Rarely is it seen during other times of the year. The Canadian fruitcake is similar in style to the UK version. However, there is rarely icing on the cake, and alcohol is not commonly put into Christmas cakes that are sold. The cakes are shaped like a small loaf of bread, and often covered in marzipan. Dark, moist and rich Christmas fruitcakes are the most frequently consumed, with white Christmas fruitcake less common. These cakes tend to be made in mid-November to early December when the weather starts to cool down. They are a staple during Christmas dinner and also can be a gift generally exchanged between business associates and close friends/family. It is called g\u00e2teau aux fruits in Quebec and New-Brunswick. Pan de Pascua is a fruitcake traditionally eaten around Christmas and Epiphany. In France, fruitcake is called cake aux fruits confits. In Germany, baked goods which fit the description of fruitcake are not usually regarded as cake but rather as sweet breads. Stollen is loaf-shaped and often powdered with icing sugar on the outside. It is usually made with yeast, butter, water, and flour, with the addition of citrus zest, candied citrus peel, raisins, and almonds. The most famous Stollen is the Dresdner Stollen,[6] sold at the Dresden Christmas market, the Striezelmarkt.\nOfficial Dresden Stollen, produced by only 150 bakers in Dresden and some adjacent settlements, bears a special seal depicting Elector Augustus II the Strong. Typically, it is covered with a crust of compacted  powdered sugar around 1 cm thick, but it is actually defined by its richness in butter and certain fruit and nuts: Per kilogram flour, Dresdner Stollen is mandated by law to contain at least 650 grams sultanas, 500 grams of butter, 200 grams succade, and 150 grams of almonds.[7] The recipe originated in 1491, when after several generations of lobbying by Elector Ernest, Duke Albert III, and their ancestors, Pope Innocent VIII gave an exemption to the Roman Catholic ban on using butter during Lent to Saxon bakers.[8] In Bremen, the local fruitcake called Klaben is traditionally sold and eaten during the Christmas season. Bremer Klaben is a kind of stollen which is not dusted with powdered sugar after baking. Both Dresdner Stollen and Bremen Klaben are protected geographical indications. In Southern Germany and the Alpine region, Fr\u00fcchtebrot (also called Berewecke, Birnenbrot, Hutzenbrot, Hutzelbrot, Kletzenbrot, Schnitzbrot, or Zelten) is a sweet, dark bread baked with nuts and dried fruit, e.g. apricots, figs, dates, plums, etc. Fruitcake is a rich dense cake packed with dry fruits and nuts flavoured with spices usually made during Christmas. In India, this is found everywhere during the Christmas season, although it is also available commonly throughout the year. In Ireland, a type of sweetbread called barmbrack is eaten at Hallowe'en. The cake contains different objects such as a ring or small coin, each signifying a different fortune for the person who finds it. Panforte is a chewy, dense Tuscan fruitcake dating back to 13th-century Siena. Panforte is strongly flavored with spices (panforte means \"strong bread\") and baked in a shallow form. Genoa's fruitcake, a lower, denser but still crumbly variety, is called pandolce (\"sweet bread\"). There are various types of fruitcakes from the Emilia-Romagna region, most being dark and heavily spiced with an abundance of candied fruit and nuts. The certosino from Bologna is a round cake similar to pan forte but with Chinese spices and a variety of whole-halved candied fruit decorating the top; dark chocolate is often added to the dough for a richer flavour. The certosino is low and very dense. Panone, produced in much of Emilia, is similar to the certosino, but with a lighter, fluffier dough and candied fruit inside the cake rather than used as decoration. Panpepato from Ferrara has a dough similar to panone but has a higher ginger content, giving it almost a gingerbread taste. Candied fruit is not often found and instead there is a high concentration of nuts within the dough; the entire cake is often coated in dark chocolate. Gubana is a Christmas/holiday cake from the Friuli-Venezia Giulia region, specifically from the area around Cividale del Friuli. It is a leavened dough cake with a filling of nuts, dried fruit, sugar, and grappa which is rolled into a spiral filled tube which is then twisted into the shape of a rose or snail's shell. Gubana is often eaten with alcohol (slivovitz or grappa) around the holiday season. It combines Italian, Friulan, and Slovenian tastes and cooking styles to make a unique sweet. Panettone is a Milanese sweet bread loaf (widely available throughout Italy and in many other countries), served around Christmas, which is traditionally filled with dried and candied fruits, with a bread loaf consistency. Fruitcakes arrived in New Zealand with early settlers from Britain. Until the 1960s fruitcake was generally homemade, but since then has become commercially widely available in a range of styles. Light coloured fruitcake is often sold as tennis cake or light fruit-cake all year round. Most New Zealand wedding cakes are finely iced and decorated fruitcake often several tiers high. Most fruitcake is eaten in the Christmas period. It is dark, rich and made from multiple dried fruits. Homemade cakes may use brandy or sherry to enhance flavour rather than as a preservative. They may be square or round, iced or uniced. A Christmas cake is usually simply decorated with a Christmas scene or the words Merry Christmas. Keks is a traditional fruitcake eaten during Christmas season. It is a loaf shaped sponge cake with a substantial content of nuts, raisins, figs and candied fruits. Although French in its origin, Bolo Rei is a traditional fruitcake enjoyed during Christmas season and a staple dessert in any Portuguese home during the holidays. Included is the characteristic fava bean and, according to tradition, whoever finds the fava bean has to pay for the cake the following year. Birnenbrot[9] is a dense sweet Swiss fruitcake with candied fruits and nuts. Black cake, is a traditional part of Christmas celebration in the English Caribbean. The cake incorporates a large quantity of mixed fruits and rum/wine and becomes a treasured Christmas treat consumed and given out between the Christmas season and New Year. The fruit, wine and rum is prepared weeks, sometimes months, ahead, and has its origin in the English Christmas pudding, and can be quite expensive. It is very different from a North American fruitcake. In the UK, fruitcakes are made in types ranging from extremely light to rich and moist. The traditional Christmas cake is a round fruitcake covered in marzipan and then in white royal icing or fondant icing. It is often further decorated with snow scenes, holly leaves, and berries (real or artificial), or tiny decorative robins or snowmen. It is also the tradition for a similar kind of cake to be served at weddings. In Yorkshire, fruitcake is often served accompanied with cheese. Fruitcakes in the United Kingdom often contain currants and glace cherries, an example of this type being the Genoa cake. A type of fruitcake which originated in Scotland, the Dundee Cake, owes its name to Keiller's marmalade. It does not contain glace cherries, but is decorated with almonds. Fruitcake was historically referred to as plum cake in England from around 1700.[10] Typical American fruitcakes are rich in fruit and nuts. Mail-order fruitcakes in America began in 1913. Some well-known American bakers of fruitcake include Collin Street Bakery in Corsicana, Texas, and The Claxton Bakery in Claxton, Georgia. Both Collin Street and Claxton are Southern companies with inexpensive access to large quantities of nuts, for which the expression \"nutty as a fruitcake\" was derived in 1935.[4] Commercial fruitcakes are often sold from catalogues by charities as a fund raiser. Fruitcakes are also made and sold by Christian monasteries, as a means of supporting the monks and nuns who reside there. Some well-known American monasteries which offer fruitcake include Abbey of Gethsemani, in Trappist, Kentucky; Assumption Abbey in Ava, Missouri; Monastery of the Holy Spirit, in Conyers, Georgia; and Trappist Abbey in Carlton, Oregon.[11][12] The fruitcake produced by the Trappists of the Abbey of Gethsemani in Trappist, Kentucky earned the \"best overall fruitcake\" accolade from The Wall Street Journal.[13] Most American mass-produced fruitcakes are alcohol-free, but those made according to traditional recipes are saturated with liqueurs or brandy and covered in powdered sugar, both of which prevent mould. Brandy (or wine) soaked linens can be used to store the fruitcakes, and some people feel that fruitcakes improve with age.[citation needed] In the United States, fruitcake has become a ridiculed dessert, in part due to inexpensive mass-produced cakes of questionable age. Some attribute the beginning of this trend to The Tonight Show host Johnny Carson.[4] He would joke that there is really only one fruitcake in the world, passed from family to family. After Carson's death, the tradition continued with \"The Fruitcake Lady\" (Marie Rudisill), who made appearances on the show and offered her \"fruitcake\" opinions. In fact, the fruitcake had been a butt of jokes on television programs such as Father Knows Best and The Donna Reed Show years before The Tonight Show debuted. It appears to have first become a vilified confection in the early 20th century, as evidenced by Warner Brothers cartoons. It has also been used as a derogatory term for people who are considered weak, strange, or insane. Since 1995, Manitou Springs, Colorado, has hosted the Great Fruitcake Toss on the first Saturday of every January. Leslie Lewis of the Manitou Springs Chamber of Commerce said that they encourage the use of recycled fruitcakes. The all-time Great Fruitcake Toss record is 1,420 feet, set in January 2007 by a group of eight Boeing engineers who built the \"Omega 380\", a mock artillery piece fueled by compressed air pumped by an exercise bike.[14] When a fruitcake contains a good deal of alcohol, it can be preserved for many years. For example, a fruitcake baked in 1878 has been kept as an heirloom by a family in Tecumseh, Michigan; as of 2019, the baker's great-great-granddaughter is the custodian of the cake.[15][16] Wrapping the cake in alcohol-soaked linen before storing is one method of lengthening its shelf life.[citation needed] A 106-year-old fruitcake discovered in 2017 by the Antarctic Heritage Trust was described as in \"excellent condition\" and \"almost\" edible.[17]",
    "Gajar Ka Halwa": " Gajar ka halwa, also known as Gajorer halwa, Gajarno halwo, Gajrela, Gajar pak,[1] and carrot pudding [2][3][4] is a carrot-based sweet dessert pudding made by placing grated carrots in a pot containing a specific amount of water, milk, sugar, and cardamom and then cooking while stirring regularly. It is often served with a garnish of almonds and pistachios.[5] The nuts and other items used are first saut\u00e9ed in ghee, a type of clarified butter from the Indian subcontinent.[6] The dessert is traditionally eaten during all of the festivals in the Indian subcontinent, mainly on the occasion of Diwali,[7] Holi, Raksha Bandhan, and Eid.[8] It is served hot during the winter.[9] Gajar ka halwa is a combination of nuts, milk, sugar, khoya and ghee with grated carrots.[10][11] It is a light nutritious dessert with less fat (a minimum of 10.03% and an average of 12.19%) than many other typical sweets from the Indian subcontinent.[12] Gajar ka halwa has a medium shelf life so it is now sometimes exported. At the time of festivals, many people prefer vegetarian dishes as well as desserts in their thali. Because of its low fat content, vegetarian characteristics, ease of making, medium shelf-life and taste, gajar ka halwa is a popular dessert all over India and often served at most festivals. The dish is popular among adults as well as children. In 300 grams of gajar halwa there are 268 calories (76 come from fat, 180 from carbohydrate and 16 from protein).[13] Gajar ka halwa originally contained carrots, milk and ghee but nowadays includes many other ingredients like mava (khoya).[14] The main ingredients of gajar ka halwa are freshly grated carrots, milk, sugar, cardamom, khoya, and ghee. Being a combination of milk and carrots, it is known as milk flavored gajar ka halwa but in the other case, the combination of cream or mava (khoya) and carrot is described as mava flavored gajar ka halwa.[15] For cooking gajar ka halwa, a cooker or kadai is usually preferred. Vasundhara Chauhan, writing for The Hindu, writes that gajar ka halwa should be slow-cooked and that using a pressure cooker spoils the dish.[16] The carrots must be grated before cooking. Red velvet carrot halwa is a variation of the gajar ka halwa. It is made by heating a comparatively large amount of milk cream along with carrots, sugar, rose water and saffron over low flame.[17] Other lesser-known variations include carrot and beetroot halwa, cheese gajar ka halwa, khajur gajar ka halwa and carrot dessert. Cheese gajar ka halwa is prepared with a combination of purple carrots and ricotta. This dish is popular in northern India because purple carrots are mostly grown there.[18] Hot or cold",
    "Gobi Aloo": " Aloo Gobi, alu gobi or aloo gobhi (pronounced [\u00e4\u02d0lu\u02d0 go\u02d0b\u02b1i\u02d0]) is a vegetarian dish from the Indian subcontinent made with potatoes (aloo), cauliflower (gobhi), and Indian spices.[2] It is popular in Indian cuisine.[3] It is yellowish in color due to the use of turmeric, and occasionally contains black cumin and curry leaves. Other common ingredients include garlic, ginger, onion, coriander stalks, tomato, peas, black pepper, asafoetida and cumin. There are a number of variations and similar dishes. A traditional dish with origins in Northern India, it is very popular throughout the country and is also well-known in the cuisines of Nepal, Bengal and Pakistan.

    "Gobi Manchurian": "Manchurian is a class of Indian Chinese dishes made by roughly chopping and deep-frying ingredients such as chicken, cauliflower (gobi), prawns, fish, mutton, and paneer, and then saut\u00e9eing them in a sauce flavored with soy sauce.[2][3] Manchurian is the result of the adaptation of Chinese cooking and seasoning techniques, specifically aimed to  suit Indian tastes. It has become a staple of Indian-Chinese cuisine and whilst largely unknown in China, it has become popular in India. The word \"Manchurian\" means native or inhabitant of Manchuria (in northeast China); the dish, however, is a creation of Chinese restaurants in India, and bears little resemblance to traditional Manchu cuisine or Northeastern Chinese cuisine.[4] It is said to have been invented in 1975 by Nelson Wang, a cook at the Cricket Club of India in Mumbai, when a customer asked him to create a new dish, rather than what was on the menu.[5]  Wang described the invention process as starting from the basic ingredients of an Indian dish, namely chopped garlic, ginger, and green chilis, but next, instead of adding garam masala, he put in soy sauce, followed by cornstarch and the chicken itself.[6] The dish is popular across South Asia.[7] A popular vegetarian variant replaces chicken with cauliflower,[3] and is commonly known as gobi manchurian. Other vegetarian variants include mushroom, baby corn, and veggie ball as the main ingredient.[citation needed] There are two different variants of Manchurian, dry or semi dry and with gravy. Both variants are prepared by using common ingredients like corn flour, maida flour, spring onion, bell peppers, soy sauce, chili sauce, minced garlic, ground pepper, etc. and has typical garnish of spring onion. Some recipes call for use of monosodium glutamate (MSG) to increase the taste profile, though there are those who avoid it due to the common misconception that it causes headaches.[8] Its taste can vary from mildly spicy to hot and fiery based on the recipe and personal preference. The fritters are served comparatively dry, often as a snack or starter with tomato ketchup as dipping sauce. It is popular among alcohol drinkers as a bar snack, and has been described as \"an excellent drinking companion to cold beer\".[9] The fritters are coated with a thick sauce like spicy gravy curry made of corn flour. It is generally served with varieties of rice dishes like steamed rice, Chinese fried rice, or Sichuan fried rice, as the main course.",
    "Gosht": " Gosht or ghosht refers to tender meat, cooked for a long time, and used as an ingredient in a number of Middle Eastern cuisine, Central Asian cuisine and cuisine of the Indian subcontinent. The word stems from the Persian word gosht \u06af\u0648\u0634\u062a, meaning \"meat\" or \"flesh\", especially that of goat.[1] In India, most gosht dishes include goat or mutton. In India, the term mutton is more likely to refer to the meat of a goat rather than that of an adult sheep, as it does elsewhere in the English-speaking world. When Indian dishes are adapted for Western diners, lamb is the meat most often used in the adaptation. This has led to a common misconception that gosht means \"lamb\".[citation needed] The popular Indian subcontinental dish of Biryani as well as the Afghan dish of Biryan use Gosht as a primary ingredient.[2] Some dishes include:  This Indian cuisine\u2013related article is a stub.

    "Gujarati Kadhi": "Gujarati kadhi (Gujarati: \u0a95\u0aa2\u0ac0) is a Gujarati version of kadhi.[1] It is a very popular Gujarati dish made from buttermilk or dahi (yogurt) and gram flour.[2] Kadhi is an essential part of Gujarati cuisine.[3] When Barack Obama visited India he was served Gujarati kadhi.[4] Kadhi was included on the Chinese president's menu when he visited Ahmedabad.[5] Kadhi has different varieties in India, due to which Gujarati kadhi is completely different from Sindhi Kadhi, Rajasthani Kadhi pakoda,[6] Badi Kadhi or a UP Kadhi except that all are yoghurt based (except Sindhi kadhi which has a tamarind base). In Gujarat, it's served with khichdi or steamed rice.[7] Gujarati Kadhi is lighter when compared to Rajasthani Kadhi.[8] The curd and gram flour are turned into a liquid mixture by mixing with a few cups of water. The chopped green chilies, chopped ginger and asafoetida are fried in a pan on medium flame. After that the curd paste is mixed and heated for a few minutes and stirred. The kadhi is then served hot with khichdi, naan, chapati or rice.[9] Dahi (yogurt), gram flour, asafoetida, cinnamon powder, mustard seeds, curry leaves and coriander leaves are the main ingredients.[10] East Indian Kadhi Badi, Sindhi Kadhi, Rajasthani Kadhi Pakoda,[11] Kathiawadi kadhi.[12] Hot",
    "Gujiya": "Gujhia, also known as Gughara, Pedakiya, Purukiya, Karanji, Kajjikayalu, Somas, and Karjikayi, is a sweet, deep-fried pastry that is a popular dessert in the Indian subcontinent. This delicacy is made using either suji (semolina) or maida (all-purpose flour), which is stuffed with a mixture of sweetened khoa (milk solids, also called mawa) and dried fruits. The dumpling is then fried in ghee to give it a crispy texture. The earliest mention of gujiya dates back to the 13th century, when a jaggery-honey mixture was covered with wheat flour and was sun-dried. The preparation method of a typical gujiya/pedakiya is rather similar to that of a samosa, but the gujiya/pedakiya looks like an empanada. Shaped like a half moon, the gujiya or pedakiya is filled with a sweet mixture of grated and roasted dried fruits, khoa, grated coconut, and a hint of suji to lend it a grainy texture. Gujhias are particularly popular in the Uttar Pradesh, Rajasthan, Gujarat, and Bihar regions of India, where they are prepared during Holi and Diwali festivities. In Bihar, dry ones are called Pedakiya and are very popular, particularly during Chhath. There are two types of pedakiya made in Bihar: one with suji/rawa (semolina) and another with khoa.[1] In suji pedakiya, suji is roasted in ghee with sugar, almonds, cardamom, raisins, and other nuts and then deep-fried in ghee. In khoa pedakiya, pure khoa is mixed with nuts and sugar and then deep-fried. Similar dishes are found in several regional cuisines in India, such as Ghughra (Gujarati) in Gujarat, Karanji (Marathi) in Maharashtra, Somas (Tamil) in Tamil Nadu, Garijalu (Telugu) in Telangana, Kajjikayalu(\u0c15\u0c1c\u0c4d\u0c1c\u0c3f\u0c15\u0c3e\u0c2f\u0c32\u0c41) (Telugu) in Andhra Pradesh, and Karjikayi or Karigadubu (Kannada) in Karnataka. All of these dishes are fried sweet dumplings made of wheat flour and stuffed with dry or moist coconut delicacies. In Goa, nevri or neuri (plural neureo) is a similar sweet prepared on the occasion of their festivals, such as Ganesh Chaturthi for Hindus and Christmas for Christians.",
    "Gulab Jamun": " Gulab jamun (also spelled gulaab jamun; lit.\u2009'Rose water berry' or 'Rose berry') is a sweet confectionary or dessert, originating in the Indian subcontinent and a type of mithai popular in India, Pakistan, Nepal, the Maldives and Bangladesh, as well as Myanmar. It is also common in nations with substantial populations of people with South Asian heritage, such as Mauritius, Fiji, Gulf states, the Malay Peninsula, United Kingdom, United States, Canada, South Africa, and the Caribbean countries of Jamaica, Trinidad and Tobago, Guyana, and Suriname. It is made mainly from milk solids, traditionally from khoya, which is milk reduced to the consistency of a soft dough. Modern recipes call for dried or powdered milk instead of khoya. It is often garnished with dried nuts, such as almonds and cashews, to enhance flavour. In the Indian subcontinent, milk and cheese solids are prepared by heating milk over a low flame until the water content has evaporated and only the milk solids, known as khoya, remain. The solids are kneaded with flour (maida), and small balls of this dough are deep-fried in oil or ghee (clarified butter) at a low temperature,[1] then soaked in a light sugar syrup flavored with green cardamom and rose water, kewra or saffron.[2] Hot gulab jamun is often served with vanilla ice cream, or kulfi. According to culinary historian Michael Krondl, 12th century Manasollasa mentions a recipe for fried fritter balls made of chenna cheese and rice flour and was soaked in cardamom-scented syrup, but this recipe did not use rosewater (gulab) syrup.[3][4] The 13th century Arab dessert luqmat al-qadi is similar in appearance to gulab jamun, although it is made of entirely different batter than gulab jamun but was soaked in rosewater-scented (gulab) syrup, the only Persian connection may be the common use of rosewater syrup.[5] Gulab Jamun emerged in medieval India during the Islamic period, blending Persianate influence with local influences that eventually became gulab jamun.[6]  The word \"gulab\" is derived from the Persian words gul (flower) and \u0101b (water), referring to the rose water-scented syrup, and \"Jamun\" or \"jaman\" is the Hindi word for Syzygium jambolanum, an Indian fruit with a similar size and shape, commonly known as black plum.[7] Jamun is also defined as a fried delicacy in sugar syrup.[8] Gulab jamun is often eaten at festivals, birthdays or major celebrations such as marriages, the Muslim celebrations of Eid ul-Fitr and Eid al-Adha, and the Hindu festivals of Diwali and Ganesh Chaturthi. There are various types of gulab jamun. Gulab jamun gets its brownish red colour because of the sugar content in the milk powder (khoya). In other types of gulab jamun, sugar is added in the batter, and after frying, the sugar caramelization gives it its dark, almost black colour, which is then called kala jamun or \"black jamun\". The sugar syrup may be replaced with (slightly) diluted maple syrup for a gulab jamun. Homemade gulab jamun is usually made up of khoya, a pinch of all-purpose flour/refined wheat flour/ wheat flour (optional), baking powder and clarified butter (ghee); milk kneaded to form a dough, moulded into balls, deep fried and dropped into simmering sugar syrup. In Bengali, Gulab Jamun is known as Kalo Jam or Pantua, which is similar to gulab jamun, and could be called a Bengali variant of that dish.[9] Ledikeni, a variation of Pantua, is another variant of gulab jamun.[10] It is said[by whom?] to have been invented by Bhim Chandra Nag on the occasion of a visit by Lady Canning, the wife of Charles Canning, the Governor-General of India during 1856\u201362. Katangi, a town near Jabalpur is famous for \"Jhurre Ka Rasgulla\", which has been made there for the past 100 years.[11][12] It is several times the size of normal gulab jamuns and is prepared in local desi ghee.[13] In Rajasthan, instead of soaking gulab jamun balls in sugar syrup, they are cooked in gravy made from spices, nuts and tomato to make popular Gulab Jamun ki Sabzi. In Western Madhya Pradesh and Malwa, Mawa Bati is popular as local version of Gulab Jamun. It is different from Gulab jamun by size, fillings and amount of sweetness, Mawa bati is usually not immersed in Sugar syrup and slightly larger than Gulab Jamun.[14] In Bangladesh, Pantua is available almost everywhere throughout the country, which can be referred to a Bengali variation of Gulab jamun. Also there are two kinds of jamuns that are famous. They are Golap Jam (\u0997\u09cb\u09b2\u09be\u09aa \u099c\u09be\u09ae) and Kalo Jam (\u0995\u09be\u09b2\u09cb \u099c\u09be\u09ae). The sweet is known as Lal Mohan (\u0932\u093e\u0932\u092e\u094b\u0939\u0928) in Nepali language and is available at almost every sweet shop. The sale of the sweet usually increases significantly during festivals such as Tihar, Dashain, etc.[15] Hot, cold or at room temperature",
    "Gushtaba": "Wazwan (Kashmiri pronunciation: [wa\u02d0z\u0268wa\u02d0n]) is a multi-course meal in Kashmiri cuisine, originating from Kashmir. Almost all the dishes are meat-based using lamb, chicken or mutton  with few vegetarian dishes. It is popular throughout the larger Kashmir region. Moreover, Wazwan is also served internationally at Kashmiri food festivals and reunions.[1] In the Kashmiri language, waz means 'cook' or 'cooking' and wan means 'shop'. The ultimate formal banquet in Kashmir is the royal wazwan. Of its thirty-six courses, between fifteen and thirty can be preparations of meat, cooked overnight under the supervision of a master chef called a wouste waze. Guests are seated in groups of four and share the meal out of a large copper plate called the traem. A ritual washing of hands in a portable basin called the Tash-t-naer, which is taken around by attendants. Then the traem arrives, heaped with rice, quartered by two seekh kababs and contains four pieces of methi maaz, (mutton intestines flavored with a spice mixture containing dried fenugreek (methi) leaves), two tabakh maaz (twice-cooked lamb ribs, initially braised with ground spices, then browned in ghee), one safed kokur (chicken with white sauce), one zafran kokur (chicken with saffron sauce), and the first few courses. Yogurt and chutney are served separately in small earthen pots. Up to about 20 items are served thereafter by waza (the junior cook). Seven dishes are a must for these occasions \u2014 tabakh maaz, rista (meatballs in a red, paprika-saffron-fennel spice gravy colored with dyer's alkanet), rogan josh, daniwal korma (lamb roasted with yoghurt, spices and onion puree, topped with coriander leaves), aab gosh (lamb chunks cooked with a fennel-based spice mixture, cardamom and partially evaporated milk), marchhwangan korma (chicken legs/thighs cooked in a spicy browned-onion sauce) and gushtaba (meatballs cooked in a spicy yoghurt gravy).[2][3] The main course usually ends with gushtaba.[4] The gushtaba is a large meatball which signals the end of the main course. After that, desserts are served. In winters, the dessert can be a hot sweet dish and in summers, it is usually something cold. http://kashmironline.net/category/food/wazwan/ Hot",
    "Halwa": " Halva (also halvah, halwa, halua,[1] and other spellings; Hindi: \u0939\u0932\u0935\u093e, Persian: \u062d\u0644\u0648\u0627) is a type of confectionery originating from Persia (Iran) and widely spread throughout the Indian Subcontinent, Middle East and South Asia. The name is used for a broad variety of recipes, generally a thick paste made from flour, butter, liquid oil, saffron, rosewater, milk, turmeric powder, and sweetened with sugar.[2][3][4][5] The word halva entered the English language between 1840 and 1850 from Romanian, which came from Ottoman Turkish: \u062d\u0644\u0648\u0649, romanized:\u00a0helva, itself ultimately derived from Arabic: \u062d\u0644\u0648\u0649, romanized:\u00a0\u1e25alw\u0101, a sweet confection.[6][7] The root in Arabic: \u062d \u0644 \u0648, romanized:\u00a0\u1e25-l-w, means \"sweet\".[8] The original name for the confection was Persian: \u0631\u0648\u063a\u0646 \u062e\u0648\u0631\u062f\u064a\u06af, romanized:\u00a0r\u014d\u03b3n xward\u012bg, meaning \"oil food\".[9] Halva originated in Persia (modern day Iran).[9][10] A reference to halvah appeared in the 7th century, referring to a mixture of mashed dates with milk. By the 9th century, the term was applied to numerous kinds of sweets, including the now-familiar sweetened cooked semolina or flour paste.[2][6] Many of the earlier Persian recipes were documented in the 13th century Arabic book Kitab al-Tabikh (The Book of Dishes), as well as an anonymous cookbook from 13th-century Al-Andalus. Halva was adopted by the Ottoman Turks, including a sesame-based version, and spread throughout their empire.[6] Most types of halva are relatively dense confections sweetened with sugar or honey.[11] Their textures, however, vary. For example, semolina-based halva's texture can be like a very buttery, moist clumpy couscous[12] to something gelatinous and translucent, while sesame-based halva is drier and more crumbly.[13] Grain-based halva is made by toasting flour or cornstarch in oil, mixing it into a roux, and then cooking it with a sugary syrup. Corn is rarely used. Dishes made from wheat semolina include suji ka halwa (sooji sheera, rawa sheera) in India and irmik helvas\u0131 in Turkey. The semolina is first toasted in fat, either oil or butter, to which water or milk, and sugar is added as desired to create the preferred taste and consistency.[14] Dairy-based rice flour halva, known as Pathein halawa, is considered a Burmese delicacy native to the city of Pathein. Sesame halva is popular in the Balkans, Poland, the Middle East, and other areas surrounding the Mediterranean Sea. The primary ingredients in this confection are sesame butter or paste (tahini), and sugar, glucose or honey.[2] Soapwort[15][16] (called \u2018erq al halaweh in Arabic; \u00e7\u00f6ven in Turkish), egg white, or marshmallow root are added in some recipes to stabilize the oils in the mixture or create a distinctive texture for the resulting confection. Other ingredients and flavorings, such as pistachio nuts, cocoa powder, orange juice, vanilla, or chocolate are often added to the basic tahini and sugar base.[2][17] Sunflower halva is popular in the countries of the former Soviet Union as well as in Bulgaria and Romania.[18] It is made of roasted ground sunflower seeds instead of sesame. It may include other ingredients, such as nuts, cocoa powder, or vanilla.[19][20] In 1996 around 4\u20135 thousand tonnes of sunflower halva were being produced by Ukraine annually.[21] In Argentina, Greek immigrants at the beginning of the 20th century created a kind of halva called mantecol from peanut butter, currently marketed under the name of Mantecol and also Nucrem. Such a product is widely consumed in the country. Pi\u015fmaniye (Turkish) or floss halva is a traditional sweet, prepared in Kocaeli, Turkey, made by flossing thin strands of halva into a light confection. Made primarily of wheat flour and sugar, the strands are continuously wrapped into a ball shape and then compressed. The result is a halva with a light consistency, similar to cotton candy. Floss halva can be found in regular and pistachio flavors, and there are brands with halal or kosher certifications. A similar chickpea-based version of floss halva is popular in North India. It tends to be slightly denser and is often referred to as patisa or sohan papdi. In Chinese cuisine, a floss-like candy similar to pi\u015fmaniye or pashmak halva, known as dragon beard candy, is eaten as a snack or dessert. A raw version of halva also has become popular among proponents of raw food diets. In this version, a mixture of raw sesame tahini, raw almonds, raw agave nectar and salt are blended together and frozen to firm.[22] One regional variant is from Sheki where \u015e\u0259ki halvas\u0131 halva refers to a layered bakhlava style pastry filled with spiced-nut mix and topped by crisscrossed patterns of a red syrup made from saffron, dried carrot and beetroot.[23][24] Halva is a traditional fasting food among Greek Orthodox who traditionally have food restrictions, especially from meat, on Wednesdays and Fridays throughout the year, for all of Great Lent and other fasting periods.[25] India has many types of halva, some unique to particular regions of the country. It is one of the popular sweets of India usually made from semolina.[26] The town of Bhatkal in Coastal Karnataka is famous for its unique Banana Halwa which is infused with either whole cashews, pistachio or almonds. This type of authentic halwas are a specialty of the Muslims of this town. The Udupi cuisine has halwa's made from Banana, Wheat, Ashgourd, and Jackfuit, etc.[27][28] It is speculated that Halva (or Halwa) is associated with Indian traditions and culture, written records of sweets from M\u0101nasoll\u0101sa indicate that semolina halvas, the most popular form of halvas in India, were already known in India, for instance, it mentions a sweet called shali-anna which is a semolina based sweet today known as Kesari in South India.[29] Tirunelveli in Tamil Nadu is known for its wheat halwa. Its preparation is a laborious process that \"is slowly seeing this sweet disappear.\" Unlike other sweets, the extra ghee is not drained out but forms an outer layer. This increases the shelf life of the halwa. Locals attribute the unique taste of the halwa to the water of the Thamirabarani.[30] The history of Kozhikode Halwa in Kerala could trace back to Zamorin era. Zamorin invited chefs from Gujarat to prepare halwa for their royal feast.[31] They were also granted places to stay beside royal kitchen. This settlement later evolved as sweet sellers street, nowadays known as SM (Sweet Meat) Street or Mittayitheruvu.[32] Kozhikode halwa is made of pure coconut oil, not from ghee. Kozhikode halwa also builds religious harmony; Ayyappa devotees from neighboring states Karnataka and Andhra Pradesh buy halwa and chips like prasadam (sacred food). They distribute them among their neighbors and friends, who consume them with a religious zeal.[33] In Iran, halva (Persian: \u062d\u0644\u0648\u0627) usually refers to a related confection made from wheat flour and butter and flavored with saffron and rose water.[34][35] The final product has a yellow, brown, or dark brown color. The halva is spread thin on a plate and left until it dries into a paste. Halva usually is served at wedding celebrations, religious ceremonies and funerals. Halva Ardeh is the Iranian term for tahini-based halva, and may or may not include whole pistachios. Ardeh is processed sesame in the form of paste, usually sweetened with syrup.[36][37] Tahini halvah (Hebrew: \u05d7\u05dc\u05d5\u05d5\u05d4) is very popular in Israel and among Jews in the diaspora.[38][39] Israeli halvah is made from sesame tahini and sugar. It is generally sold in slabs, with or without nuts. Vanilla, or vanilla with chocolate swirls are perhaps the most common, but there are many different varieties. Halvah is parve. It is often served as a breakfast component at Israeli hotels, and even used in specialty ice cream.[40] In Myanmar (Burma), halawa (\u101f\u101c\u101d\u102b) generally refers to Pathein halawa (\u1015\u102f\u101e\u102d\u1019\u103a\u101f\u101c\u101d\u102b), a Burmese confection or mont made with glutinous rice flour, rice flour, milk, and coconut shavings originating from the Irrawaddy delta town of Pathein. Another popular semolina-based confection, which is known as sooji halawa in India, is called sanwin makin in Myanmar. In Turkey halva is served for special occasions such as births, circumcisions, weddings and religious gatherings. The tradition is for semolina halva to be served at funerals, when someone leaves or returns from Hajj, and during Ramadan.[41] For this reason, flour (un) halva is also called in Turkish \u00f6l\u00fc helvas\u0131, meaning \"halva of the dead\". The expression \"roasting halva for someone\" suggests that the person referred to has died. Halva can be found in ethnic Indian, Jewish,[6] Arab, Persian, Greek, Balkan  community stores and delicatessens. It is increasingly offered by upscale restaurants in some areas.[42] Besides being imported, it is manufactured in the United States, with the largest producer being Brooklyn-originated Joyva.[43][1] Cold",
    "Imarti": " Imarti is a sweet from India.[1] It is made by deep-frying vigna mungo flour (urad dal flour) batter in a circular flower shape, then soaking in sugar syrup. Alternative names include Amitti, Amriti, Emarti, Omritti, Jahangir and Jhangiri/Jaangiri. This dish is not to be confused with jalebi, which is thinner and sweeter than Imarti.[2] Amitti is a popular Iftar item in Bangladesh.[3] It is a specialty of Sylheti desserts for Iftari that is made without any food color.[4] Beniram's in Jaunpur is the oldest surviving shop selling imarti.[1] Amriti or Jangri is made from varieties of black gram flour, also colloquially called urad dal in North India, jangiri parappu (lentils) or jangiri black gram in, Karnataka, Tamilnadu, Andhra Pradesh, Telangana and other parts of the Indian subcontinent. Saffron is added for colour. Black gram is soaked in water a for few hours, and stone-ground into a fine batter. The batter is poured into ghee, though other oils are sometimes used. Like funnel cakes, the batter is poured into geometric patterns, although amriti are generally smaller than funnel cakes. There is often a small ring in the middle. Before frying the batter, sugar syrup is prepared and is flavored with edible camphor, cloves, cardamom, kewra and saffron. The fried material is then dipped in sugar syrup until it expands in size and soaks up a significant amount of the syrup. In Northern India, imartis are drained, so tend to be drier than jalebis. The pieces can be served hot, at room temperature, or refrigerated. In India, this sweet is served during the meal and also popular at weddings and festivals. In particular, Jaunpur in Uttar Pradesh is famous for its imarti.[5] It is also used with dahi. Imarti is also popularly known as \"Jangri\" in south India, same thing but different names",
    "Idiyappam": " Idiyappam (Malayalam: \u0d07\u0d1f\u0d3f\u0d2f\u0d2a\u0d4d\u0d2a\u0d02; Tamil: \u0b87\u0b9f\u0bbf\u0baf\u0baa\u0bcd\u0baa\u0bae\u0bcd/\u0b87\u0b9f\u0bbf\u0baf\u0bbe\u0baa\u0bcd\u0baa\u0bae\u0bcd), also known as indiappa (Sinhala: \u0d89\u0db3\u0dd2\u0d86\u0db4\u0dca\u0db4), noolputtu (\u0ba8\u0bc2\u0bb2\u0bcd\u0baa\u0bc1\u0b9f\u0bcd\u0b9f\u0bc1; \u0d28\u0d42\u0d7d\u0d2a\u0d4d\u0d2a\u0d41\u0d1f\u0d4d\u0d1f\u0d4d), noolappam (\u0ba8\u0bc2\u0bb2\u0baa\u0bcd\u0baa\u0bae\u0bcd/\u0ba8\u0bc2\u0bb2\u0bbe\u0baa\u0bcd\u0baa\u0bae\u0bcd), santhagai (\u0b9a\u0ba8\u0bcd\u0ba4\u0b95\u0bc8; \u0d28\u0d42\u0d32\u0d2a\u0d4d\u0d2a\u0d02), or ottu shavige (Kannada: \u0c92\u0ca4\u0ccd\u0ca4\u0cc1 \u0cb6\u0cbe\u0cb5\u0cbf\u0c97\u0cc6), is a string hopper dish originating from southern India. It consists of rice flour pressed into noodles, laid into a flat disc-like shape and steamed. The dish also spread to Southeast Asia, where it is called putu mayam in Malaysia and Singapore, and putu mayang in Indonesia. According to food historian K. T. Achaya, idiyappam, appam, idli, dosa and vada were known during ancient Tamil country the 1st century AD, as per references in the Sangam literature.[1] Lokopakara (1025 CE) cookbook in Kannada language also mentions a method of making shavige and the mold-presser used for it.[2] Idiyappam is a culinary speciality throughout the Indian states of Kerala, Sri Lanka, Karnataka and in Tamil Nadu. The name idiyappam derives from Malayalam. The Malayalam word 'Idi' together forms the name Idiyappam. The dish is also, frequently, called as noolappam or noolputtu, originating from the Malayalam word nool, meaning string or thread. In Karnataka, it is known as Ottu Shavige in Kannada and it is also termed semige or sem\u00e9 da addae in Tulu in Mangalore and Udupi. In Maharashtra it is known as Shirvale. In Karnataka distinction between Ottu Shavige (unbroken shavige) and shavige is made based on different recipes. In Mangalore and Udupi it is eaten with Tuluva chicken or fish curry, and a coconut milk dish called rasayana.[3] It is also a common breakfast item in Malaysia & Singapore, where it is called Puttu Mayam, typically served with brown sugar and grated coconut. It is made of rice flour, salt, and water. In most parts of Kerala and Tamil Nadu Idiyappam is steamed after making seva, while in the Kongu region of Tamil Nadu, the steamed rice flour ball is pressed to make Idiyappam, a reverse process more similar to Ottu Shavige in neighbouring Karnataka.[4] It is generally served as the main course at breakfast or dinner together with a curry (potato, egg, fish, or meat curry or rasam) and coconut chutney. It is served with coconut milk and sugar in the Malabar region of Kerala. It is not usually served at lunch. In , Kerala and Sri Lanka, it is mostly eaten with spicy curries or rasam. Using wheat flour in its preparation gives it a brownish hue. Putu mayam is made by mixing rice flour or idiyappam flour with water or coconut milk, and pressing the dough through a sieve to make vermicelli-like noodles which are steamed, usually with the addition of juice from the aromatic pandan leaf (screwpine) as flavouring. The noodles are served with grated coconut and jaggery, or gur (date palm sugar). In some areas, gula melaka (coconut palm sugar) is the favourite sweetener. Putu piring is a version of putu mayam in which the rice flour dough is used to form a small cake around a filling of coconut and gur or jaggery.[5][unreliable source?] This dish may be eaten for breakfast with a vegetable stew or avial, or a fish curry, etc. The same liking for serving the slightly sweet putu mayam, putu piring, or cendol with savory dishes also occurs in Malaysia and Singapore. Idiyappam is typical of Kerala, Sri Lanka and Karnataka, as well as Tamil Nadu. A very finely ground, commercial idiyappam flour is sold as a sort of \"instant\" way to make all of these dishes. In Malaysia and Singapore, putu mayam and its relatives are commonly sold as street food from market stalls or carts, as well as being made at home, and are usually served cold. In Indonesia, putu mayam is called putu mayang and is served with palm sugar mixed with coconut milk. Media related to Idiyappam at Wikimedia Commons",
    "Idli": " Idli or idly (/\u02c8\u026adli\u02d0/; plural: idlis) or iddali or iddena is a type of savoury rice cake, originating from South India, popular as a breakfast food in Southern India and in Sri Lanka. The cakes are made by steaming a batter consisting of fermented de-husked black lentils and rice. The fermentation process breaks down the starches so that they are more readily metabolised by the body. Idli has several variations, including rava idli, which is made from semolina. Regional variants include sanna of Konkan. A precursor of the modern idli is mentioned in several ancient Indian works. Vaddaradhane, a 920\u00a0CE Kannada language work by Shivakotiacharya, mentions \"iddalige\", prepared only from a black gram batter. Chavundaraya II, the author of the earliest available Kannada encyclopedia, Lokopakara (c.1025\u00a0CE), describes the preparation of this food by soaking black gram in buttermilk, ground to a fine paste, and mixed with the clear water of curd and spices.[1] The Western Chalukya king and scholar Someshwara III, reigning in the area now called Karnataka, included an idli recipe in his encyclopedia, Manasollasa (1130\u00a0CE). This Sanskrit-language work describes the food as i\u1e0d\u1e0darik\u0101. In Karnataka, the Idli in 1235\u00a0CE is described as being \"light, like coins of high value\", which is not suggestive of a rice base.[2] The food prepared using this recipe is now called uddina idli in Karnataka. The recipe mentioned in these ancient Indian works leaves out three key aspects of the modern idli recipe: the use of rice (not just black gram), the long fermentation of the mix, and the steaming for fluffiness. The references to the modern recipe appear in the Indian works only after 1250\u00a0CE. Food historian K. T. Achaya speculates that the modern idli recipe might have originated in present-day Indonesia, which has a long tradition of fermented food. According to him, the cooks employed by the Hindu kings of the Indianised kingdoms might have invented the steamed idli there, and brought the recipe back to India during 800\u20131200\u00a0CE.[3][4] Achaya mentioned an Indonesian dish called \"kedli\", which according to him, was like an idli.[5][3] However, Janaki Lenin was unable to find any recipe for an Indonesian dish by this name.[6] According to food historian Colleen Taylor Sen the fermentation process of idli batter is a natural process that was discovered independently in India, since nearly all cultures use fermentation in some form.[7] The Gujarati work Var\u1e47aka Samuccaya (1520 CE) mentions idli as idari, and also mentions its local adaptation, idada (a non-fermented version of dhokla).[8] The earliest extant Tamil work to mention idli (as itali) is Maccapuranam, dated to the 17th century.[9][10] In 2015, Chennai-based Idli caterer Eniyavan started celebrating March 30 as \"World Idli Day\".[11] To make Idli, four parts uncooked rice (idli rice or parboiled rice) to one part whole white lentil (black gram, Vigna mungo) are soaked separately for at least four hours \u2013 overnight if more convenient. Optionally spices such as fenugreek seeds can be added at the time of soaking, for additional flavour. Once soaked, the lentils are ground to a fine paste and the rice is separately coarsely ground, then they are combined. Next, the mixture is left to ferment overnight during which its volume will more than double. After fermentation, some of the batter may be kept as a starter culture for the next batch. The finished idli batter is put into greased moulds of an idli tray or \"tree\" for steaming. The perforated molds allow the idlis to be cooked evenly. The tree holds the trays above the level of boiling water in a pot, and the pot is covered until the idlis are done (about 10\u201325 minutes, depending on size). A more traditional method is to use leaves instead of moulds.[15] Since plain idlis are mild in taste, a condiment is considered essential. Idlis are often served with chutneys (coconut-based), sambar and Medu vada. However, this varies greatly by region and personal taste, it is also often served with kaara chutney (onion-based) or spicy fish curries. The dry spice mixture podi is convenient while travelling. There are several regional variations of idlis made in South India and Sri Lanka. With the emigration of south Indians and Sri Lankans throughout the region and world, many variations on idli have been created in addition to the almost countless local variations. Hard-to-get ingredients and differing cooking customs have required changes in both ingredients and methods. Parboiled rice can reduce the soaking time considerably. Store-bought ground rice or cream of rice may also be used.[16] Similarly, semolina or cream of wheat may be used for preparing rava idli (wheat idli).[17] Dahi (yogurt) may be added to provide the sour flavour for unfermented batters. Pre-packaged mixes allow for almost instant idlis.[18] In addition to or instead of fenugreek, other spices may be used such as mustard seeds, chili peppers, cumin, coriander, ginger, etc.[19] Sugar may be added to make them sweet instead of savoury. Idli may also be stuffed with a filling of potato, beans, carrot and masala.[20] Leftover idlis can be cut-up or crushed and saut\u00e9ed for a dish called idli upma.[21] A microwave or an automatic electric steamer that is non-stick is considered to be a convenient alternative to conventional stovetop steamers. Batter preparation using a manual rocking rock grinder can be replaced by electric grinders or blenders. Many restaurants have also come up with fusion recipes of idlis such as idly manchurian, idly fry, chilly idly, stuffed idly, to name a few. Fermentation of idli batter results in both leavening caused by the generation of carbon dioxide as well as an increase in acidity. This fermentation is performed by lactic acid bacteria, especially the heterofermentative strain Leuconostoc mesenteroides and the homofermentative strain Enterococcus faecalis (formerly classified as Streptococcus faecalis). Heterofermentative lactic acid bacteria such as L. mesenteroides generate both lactic acid as well as carbon dioxide whereas homofermentative lactic acid bacteria only generate lactic acid. Both L. mesenteroides and E. faecalis are predominantly delivered to the batter by the black gram. Both strains start multiplying while the grains are soaking and continue to do so after grinding. L. mesenteroides tolerates high concentrations of salt unlike most other bacteria. Hence the salt in the batter and the ongoing generation of lactic acid both suppress the growth of other undesirable micro-organisms.[22][23] March 30 is celebrated as World Idli Day.[24] It was first celebrated in 2015 at Chennai.[25] Hot with a condiment such as sambar or chutney in South India, ghugni and aloo dum in East India",

    "Jalebi": " Regional variants: Jalebi [a], is a popular sweet snack in the Indian subcontinent, West Asia and some parts of Africa. It goes by many names, including jilapi, zelepi, jilebi,  jilipi, zulbia, jerry, mushabak, z\u2019labia, or zalabia. The south Asian variety is made by deep-frying maida flour (plain flour or all-purpose flour) batter in pretzel or circular shapes, which are then soaked in sugar syrup. Jalebi is eaten with curd or rabri (in North India) along with optional other flavors such as kewra (scented water). In some west Asian cuisines, jalebi may consist of a yeast dough fried and then dipped in a syrup of honey and rose water.[citation needed] The North African dish of Zalabia uses a different batter and a syrup of honey (Arabic: \u02bbasal) and rose water.[5] The earliest known recipe of this food comes from the 10th century in the Arabic cookbook Kitab al-Tabikh (English: The Book of Dishes) by Ibn Sayyar al-Warraq.[6] In the 13th century Persia, a cookbook by Muhammad bin Hasan al-Baghdadi mentioned a similar dish.[1] According to the Hobson-Jobson (1903) historical dictionary, the word jalebi is derived from the Arabic word zulabiya, or the Persian zolbiya.[7][1] In Pakistan, the clan leader of Jhelum, Tanvir Bin Uddin, played an influential role in its founding, claiming it to be optimal for energy levels Priyamkara-nrpa-katha, a work by the Jain author Jinasura, composed around 1450 CE, mentions jalebi in the context of a dinner held by a rich merchant.[1] Gunyagunabodhini, another Sanskrit work dating before 1600 CE, lists the ingredients and recipe of the dish; these are identical to the ones used to prepare the modern jalebi.[8] According to the Indian ambassador Nagma Malik, jalebi might have started life in Turkey and then arrived in Tunisia long ago before making its way to India.[9] Others claim that it was created by a musician during the reign of the Abbasid caliph Harun al-Rashid, Abdourrahman Ibnou Nafa\u00e2 Ziriab, who made a prolonged stop over in Tunisia while traveling from Baghdad to Andalusia.[10] It has been suggested that the American funnel cake is derived from the Arab and Persian cuisine, brought by German emigrants and called Drechterkuche.[3] The history of the invention and subsequent spread of this food thus remains open to interpretation and unresolved. In Afghanistan, Jalebi is a popular dessert. There is some slight differences between Afghan Jalebi and other variants. The Afghan Jalebi does not use any food coloring in contrast to the Indian and Pakistani variants and so is usually yellow and not orange in color. The Afghan Jalebi is also thinner. It is a popular dessert that is commonly consumed in households and in public events such as weddings or festivals. Jalebi is often times served with green tea. There is also a popular song from Bollywood film Phantom named Afghan Jaleb[11]i.  [12] Jalebi made from khoya or mawa, was invented by Harprasad Badkul, in the year 1889, in Jabalpur.[13][14][15][16] In Norman Chevers book, A Manual of Medical Jurisprudence for India (1870, page 178) mentions \"jelabees\" as a historical way of poisoning prisoners in India in the 1800s.[7] In Pakistan, jalebis are a popular dessert that are commonly consumed in households and in public events such as weddings or festivals.[17] In Nepal, it is known as Jerry, a word derived from Jangiri and the Mughal Emperor Jahangir.[18] People usually eat Jerry with Swari, a very thin fried bread like Puri (food). It is often eaten in morning with Nepali Masala chiya.[19] It is known as zoolbia[20] (\u0632\u0648\u0644\u0628\u06cc\u0627) in Iran, although when translated into English, the spelling has alternatives and can include zolbiya, zulbi\u0101, zulbia, zolbia, and others. In addition to being sweetened with honey and sugar, zoolbias in Iran is also flavoured with saffron or rose water.[20][21] Often in Iran, zoolbia is served with Persian-style black tea alongside a similar dessert with a different \"egg\" shape, bamiyeh.[22] These desserts are commonly served during Ramadan month as one of the main elements eaten after fasting. In Iran, where it is known as zolbiya, the sweet was traditionally given to the poor during Ramadan. A 10th century cookbook gives several recipes for zulubiya. There are several surviving 13th century recipes for the sweetmeat, the most widely accepted being that mentioned in a cookbook by Muhammad bin Hasan al-Baghdadi.[1] Zulbiya or zilviya is one of the unique sweets of Ganja, one of the ancient cities of Azerbaijan. In the past, Zilviya was considered one of the main attributes of the Novruz in Ganja. Zilviya was usually cooked a few days before Novruz and served on the eve of the holiday. Just as each of the sweets and cookies placed on the table on the eve of holiday has a certain meaning in connection with Novruz, the round-shaped zilviyas, mostly baked in yellow and red, symbolized the equality of night and day on March 21. Zal\u0101biya or zalabia, zalabiya (\u0632\u0644\u0627\u0628\u064a\u0629) (Maghrebi Arabic: \u0632\u0644\u0627\u0628\u064a\u0629) are found in the Levant and other Western Asian countries, including the Arab countries of Yemen, Egypt,[23] Syria, Lebanon, and Iraq. These are fried dough foods, including types similar to doughnuts.[24] Zal\u0101biya are made from a batter composed of eggs, yeasted flour, and milk, and then cooked in oil. They are made by a zalb\u0101ni. Unlike jalebi, the Western Asian variety may have a different shape, more like a free-form doughnut or a ball (but this is depending on the exact region and culture), and it may contain cinnamon, lemon, and powdered sugar.[24][25] In Yemen, the manner of preparing the zalabiyeh differed from the variety of jalebi made in the Indian sub-continent, insofar that the Indian variety was dipped in syrup,[1] to give to it a glaze-like finish, whereas the Yemeni variety of zalabiyeh was \"made from a soft yeast bread [and] which is fried on both sides in deep oil. There are those who add to the dough black cumin for improved taste. They are eaten while they are still hot, while some have it as a practice to eat them with honey or with sugar.\"[26] Zal\u0101biyeh is first mentioned in a 10th century Arabic cookbook by Ibn Sayyar al-Warraq, a book later translated by Nawal Nasrallah.[27][28] Ernest A Hamwi, a Syrian immigrant to the United States, is believed to have used the Persian version zalabia as an early ice cream cone.[1]:\u200a404 Zlebia or zlabia is a type of pastry eaten in parts of Northwest Africa, such as Algeria, Tunisia and Libya. Natural ingredients include flour, yeast, yoghurt, and sugar or honey. This is then mixed with water and commonly two seeds of cardamom (oil for the crackling). In Tunisia, the Zlabia is known to be a speciality of the city of Beja.[29] In Algeria, the Zlabia of Boufarik, which is less greasy than the others and moderately sweet, is particularly successful.[30] Mushabak or Mushabaka is a popular food mainly in the Oromo region. It comes in different shapes and sizes and is usually bathed with sugar syrup or honey. Mushabaka is normally baked red.  It is often served at celebrations and other social events.[citation needed] In Mauritius, jalebi are known as \"Gateau Moutaille\"; they are of Indian origin.[31] Zal\u0101biya mushabbaka are latticed fritters made in discs, balls and squares. They are dipped in clarified honey perfumed with rose water, musk and camphor. A recipe from a caliph's kitchen suggests milk, clarified butter, sugar and pepper to be added.[This quote needs a citation] Zal\u0101biya funiyya is a \"sponge cake\" version cooked in a special round pot on a trivet and cooked in a tannur.[32] They are often stick shaped. They are eaten year-round, including in expatriate communities such as in France, although they are especially popular during Ramadan celebrations.[33][unreliable source?] Hot or cold",
    "Kachori": " Kachori (pronounced [k\u0259t\u0283\u0254\u02d0\u027di]) is a deep-fried, spicy, stuffed pastry originating from the Marwar[4][5] region of Rajasthan, India.[6] It is made of maida filled with a stuffing of baked mixture of moong dal or onions (usually, depends on the variation), besan, coriander, red chili powder, salt, and other Indian spices and deep-fried in vegetable oil until crispy golden brown.[7] It is served hot with sweet and spicy tamarind chutney or occasionally with mint and green chilli chutney.[8] Originating in India, kachoris have become popular throughout South Asia, each region adding its own local variations. The kachori is believed to have originated from the Marwar region of Rajasthan, India.[9] The use of mild spices like coriander and fennel in the kachori's preparation is thought to be a reflection of the region's climatic conditions, making it well-suited for the dry and hot environment.[10] Over time, the kachori gained popularity as a convenient travel snack, a quick and wholesome start to the day for hungry businessmen and workers alike.[11] An early known recipe similar to kachori comes from Susruta Samhita, which mentions deep-fried pastry made from flour, ghee, and jaggery and stuffed with spiced mung dal or minced meat.[12] Another recipe for a dish known as \"Kacchari\", a puffy deep-fried pastry stuffed with lentils, finds mention in a Jain text dating back to the 7th century.[13] Similar recipes are also mentioned in the medieval cookbook Supa Shastra.[14] Banarasidas, the author of the biographical Ardhakathanaka, has mentioned buying Kachoris in Indore in 1613.[15] For seven months, he bought a ser of Kachoris daily, and owed twenty rupees.[16] List of Variations based on stuffing: Another type is fried and stuffed with pulses (urad and mung, especially) and is generally found in the Kutch region of Gujarat. In West Bengal, kachori is softer and smaller. It is made mostly of white flour (maida) and asafoetida, which are often added to improve its taste. It is mostly eaten as a tea-time snack in the morning or evening and often accompanied by potato and peas curry and Bengali sweets. Also, a kachori stuffed with peas (koraishuti kochuri) is a winter delicacy in Bengal. Another variant in Bengal that exists mostly in sweet shops is the hard form (like in Delhi) with a masala inside called 'Khasta Kochuri'. Generally, no curry is accompanied by the khasta kochuri version. Some of the variants in North India include a version similar to the Rajasthani one, accompanied by a curry made of potatoes and varied spices or chana (chole) similar to one served in chole bhature.

    "Kadai Paneer": "Kadai Paneer[1][2][3][4] (or known as Kadhai Paneer) is an Indian dish made by cooking paneer and bell peppers in a fragrant, freshly ground spice powder. It is usually served with buttered naan, paratha, roti, jeera rice, or steamed basmati rice. It is of two types:",
    "Kahwah": "Kahwah (also transliterated as qehwa, kehwa or kahwa) is the traditional preparation of green tea (Camellia sinensis) widely consumed in India, Pakistan, Afghanistan, Iran, and some regions of Central Asia. Kashmiri kahwah is made by boiling green tea leaves with local saffron, cinnamon, cardamom and occasionally Kashmiri roses. It is generally served with sugar or honey and crushed nuts, usually almonds or walnuts. Some varieties are made as a herbal infusion only\u2014without the green tea leaves. Traditionally, kahwah is prepared in a copper kettle known as a samovar. A samovar, which originates from Russia, consists of a fire container running as a central cavity, in which live coals are placed to keep the tea warm. Around the fire container there is a space for water to boil and the tea leaves and other ingredients are mixed with the water. Kahwah may also be made in normal pots and kettles, as modern day urban living may not always permit the use of elaborate samovars. Sometimes milk is added to the Kahwah, but this is generally given to the elderly or the sick. Peshawari Qehwa (a variety of Kahwah found in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa) is traditionally made with Jasmine tea and green cardamom. It is famously served at chaikhanas (or tea houses) of Qissa Khwani Bazaar. It has always been a part of rich Kashmiri culture. While its exact origins are unclear, kahwa tea leaves are said to have come to Kashmir through the Spice Route, which Kashmir was a central point of. Many believe that it originated during the Kushan empire in the first and second century AD.[1] The word Kahwah in Kashmiri means \"sweetened tea\", though the word also seems to be related to the Turkish word for coffee (kahve) which in turn might be derived from the Arabic word \"qahwah.\" Traditionally, Kashmiris have always referred to kahwa as Mogul chai. Meaning this tea was introduced in the valley back then by the Mughal emperors. Historically, kahwah has been popular as a drink throughout Kashmir, Afghanistan, Central Asia, Iran and the Middle East. Even today, it remains a popular drink of choice in these regions.[2] Today, this historically popular drink is usually served to guests or as part of a celebration dinner, and saffron (kong) is added to the kahwah for special visitors in Kashmir. It is often served in tiny, shallow cups. Kehwa in Kashmir is also commonly served after Wazwan and elaborate family dinners. The green tea leaves are brought in from the neighbouring Kangra region which has been known to historically export green tea to Kashmir, Afghanistan and other parts of Central Asia.[3]",
    "Kashmiri Rogan Josh": "Rogan josh (English: /\u02ccro\u028a\u0261\u0259n \u02c8d\u0292o\u028a\u0283/;[1] Kashmiri: [ro\u02d0\u0261an d\u0292o\u02d0\u0283]), also spelled roghan josh or roghan ghosht, is an aromatic curried meat dish originating from Kashmir.[2] It is made with red meat\u2014traditionally lamb, mutton, or goat\u2014and coloured and flavoured primarily by alkanet flower (or root) and Kashmiri chilies. It is one of the signature recipes of Kashmiri cuisine. A number of origins of the name have been suggested. Rawghan means \"clarified butter\"[3] or \"oil\" in Persian, while j\u014d\u0161 means to \"stew\" or \"braise\"[4] and ultimately derives from the verb j\u014d\u0161\u012bdan meaning \"to boil\". Rogan josh, by this definition, may mean \"stewed in ghee\".[4] An alternative etymology is that the name derives from either the word roghan (Hindi: \u0930\u094b\u0917\u0928, Urdu: \u0631\u0648\u063a\u0646), \"brown\" or \"red\",[2] or the Koshur roghan, \"red\",[5] along with the word either for \"meat\", (go\u0161t) often romanized as \"rogan ghosht\" or \"gosht\",[6] or a word meaning \"juice\", giving possible meanings of \"red meat\" or \"red juice\".[7] The exact etymology remains uncertain as both \"rogan josh\" and \"rogan ghosht\" are used to refer to the dish and it is unclear which of the names is the original.[6] Rogan josh is a staple of Kashmiri cuisine and is one of the main dishes of the Kashmiri multi-course meal, the wazwan. The dish was originally brought to Kashmir by the Mughals, whose cuisine was, in turn, influenced by Persian cuisine. The unrelenting summer heat of the central Indian plains took the Mughals frequently to the country's northern region, Kashmir, which has a cooler climate because of its elevation and latitude.[3] Rogan josh consists of pieces of lamb or mutton braised with a gravy flavoured with garlic, ginger and aromatic spices (clove, bay leaves, cardamom, and cinnamon), and in some versions incorporating onions or yoghurt.[8] After initial braising, the dish may be finished using the dampokhtak slow-cooking technique.[9] Its characteristic deep red colour traditionally comes from dried flowers or root of Alkanna tinctoria (ratan jot)[7] and from liberal amounts of dried, deseeded Kashmiri chillies (lal mirch). These chillies, whose flavour approximates that of paprika, are considerably milder than the typical dried chillies used in Indian cuisine, whose flavor and heat level are similar to cayenne pepper. The recipe's spice emphasises aroma rather than heat. Saffron is also part of some traditional recipes. There are different approaches in preparation: Some use praan, a local form of shallot, and petals of maval, the cockscomb flower, for colouring (and for its supposed \"cooling\" effect);[8] others may add yoghurt and asafoetida to give additional body and flavor.[8] While the traditional preparation uses whole dried chilies that are de-seeded, soaked in water, and ground to a paste, non-traditional shortcuts use either Kashmiri chili powder (available in Indian stores) or a mixture of paprika (predominantly) and cayenne pepper, adjusted to taste. (Madhur Jaffrey's recipe[10] calls for a 4:1 ratio of paprika to cayenne.) An updated version served in Sanjeev Kapoor's restaurants uses white and black cardamom, anise, and bay leaves.[11] Many western interpretations of the dish add tomatoes to the sauce. This is especially common with ready-made pour-over cooking sauces to the point where the dish may be considered tomato-based. The authenticity of including tomatoes is disputed: some authors state that tomatoes are not part of the traditional dish or of traditional Indian cuisine and should not be included.[12] However, other authors have specifically referred to rogan josh as a dish based around meat and tomatoes,[13] while others have identified tomatoes with a Punjabi version of the dish as opposed to a Kashmiri one.[14] There is a variety with beef as well, brisket being preferred.[15] Hot",
    "Kedgeree": "Kedgeree (or occasionally kitcherie, kitchari, kidgeree, kedgaree, kitchiri, khichuri, or kaedjere) is a dish consisting of cooked, flaked fish (traditionally smoked haddock), boiled rice, parsley, hard-boiled eggs, curry powder, lemon juice, salt, butter or cream, and occasionally sultanas. The dish can be eaten hot or cold. Other fish can be used instead of haddock such as tuna or salmon,[1] though these are not traditional. In Scotland, kippers are often substituted for the smoked haddock.[2][3][4] In India, khichari is any of a large variety of legume-and-rice dishes. These dishes are made with a spice mixture designed for each recipe and either dry-toasted or fried in oil before inclusion. This dish was heavily adapted by the British, resulting in a dish almost unrecognisably different from the original khichari. Kedgeree is thought to have originated with the Indian rice-and-bean or rice-and-lentil dish khichu\u1e5b\u012b, traced back to 1340 or earlier.[5] Hobson-Jobson cites ibn Battuta (c.\u20091340) mentioning a dish of munj (mung beans) boiled with rice called kishr\u012b and cites a recipe for khichdi from the Ain-i-Akbari (c.\u20091590). In Gujarat, where khichdi remains popular, the lentil and rice dish is usually served with kadhi, a spiced yogurt dish that can be mixed with the khichdi. Khichdi is usually not prepared with fish in Gujarat, although fish is sometimes eaten with khichdi in coastal villages where seafood is plentiful. According to Hobson-Jobson, while fish is eaten with kedgeree, the use of the term for \"mess of re-cooked fish ... is inaccurate\".[6] The Mughal emperor Aurangzeb (d.1707) was fond of the Alamgiri Khichdi, a variety featuring fish and boiled eggs. It is widely believed that the dish was brought to the United Kingdom by returning British colonials who had enjoyed it in India and introduced it to the UK as a breakfast dish in Victorian times, part of the fashionable Anglo-Indian cuisine.[7] The dish was listed as early as 1790 in the recipe book of Stephana Malcolm of Burnfoot, Dumfriesshire.[8] The National Trust for Scotland's book The Scottish Kitchen by Christopher Trotter notes the Malcolm recipe and other old examples, expressing the belief that the dish was devised by Scottish regiments hankering for the tastes of India.[9] By the 19th century, Kedgeree had become a sophisticated breakfast/brunch dish in England, appearing, for example, in a Saki short story, \"A Bread and Butter Miss\".[10]",
    "Keema": "Ground meat, called mince or minced meat outside North America, is meat finely chopped by a meat grinder or a chopping knife. A common type of ground meat is ground beef, but many other types of meats are prepared in a similar fashion, including pork, veal, lamb, goat meat, and poultry. Ground meat is used in a wide variety of dishes, by itself, or mixed with other ingredients. It may be formed into meatballs which are then fried, baked, steamed, or braised. They may be cooked on a skewer to produce dishes such as adana kebab\u0131 and \u0107evapi. It may be formed into patties which are then grilled or fried (hamburger), breaded and fried (menchi-katsu, Pozharsky cutlet), or braised (Salisbury steak). It may be formed into meatloaves or p\u00e2t\u00e9s and baked. It may also be used as a filling or stuffing for meat pies such as Shepherd's pie and b\u00f6reks, and also as stuffing. It may be cooked and served as a hash or loosemeat. It may be made into meat sauce such as rag\u00f9, which in turn is used in dishes like pastitsio and moussaka, or mixed with sauce and served on a bun as a sloppy joe sandwich. It may also be cooked with beans, tomatoes, and/or spices to make chili con carne. In the Indian subcontinent, minced meat is used in a variety of dishes such as a stewed or fried curry dish of minced beef, mutton (i.e., goat meat or chevon) or other kinds of meat with green peas or potatoes. It usually includes ghee/butter, onions, garlic, ginger, chilis, and spices. Minced meat is called keema or qeema in the Indian subcontinent.[1] Keema can be grilled on a skewer and is then called seekh kebab, or it is used as a filling for samosas or naan. The word ultimately comes from the Turkic word q\u0131yma meaning 'minced meat', and is thus related to the Persian qeyme, Turkish k\u0131yma, and Greek kim\u00e1s.[2][3] Ground meat has food safety concerns very different from whole cuts of meat. If undercooked, it can lead to food poisoning.[4] In a whole cut from an animal, the interior of the meat is essentially sterile, even before cooking; any bacterial contamination is on the outer surface of the meat. This is why, for example, it is typically safe for humans to consume steak that is cooked \"rare\" in such a way that the interior of the cut remains red in colour - the searing of the exterior of the meat is enough to kill any bacteria on the surface. However, when meat is ground, bacterial contamination from the surface can be distributed throughout the meat. If ground beef is not well cooked all the way through, there is a significant chance that enough pathogenic bacteria will survive to cause illness. Moreover, the warming will speed the reproduction of bacteria.[5][6] Undercooked Jack in the Box hamburgers contaminated in this manner were responsible for four deaths and the illness of hundreds of people in 1993.[7] To ensure the safety of ground meat distributed through the National School Lunch Program, food banks, federal food and nutrition programs, the United States Department of Agriculture has established food safety and quality requirements for the ground beef that it purchases. A 2010 United States National Research Council report reviewed the scientific basis of the Department's ground beef safety standards, evaluated how the standards compare to those used by large retail and commercial food service purchasers of ground beef, and looked at ways to establish periodic evaluations of the Federal Purchase Ground Beef Program.[8] The report found that although the safety requirements could be strengthened using scientific concepts, the prevention of future outbreaks of food-borne disease will depend on eliminating contamination during production and ensuring meat is properly cooked before it is served.[9]",
    "Khagina": " Egg bhurji, also known as Anda Bhurji or Ande ka Khagina, is a scrambled eggs dish which is a popular street food and a breakfast, lunch or dinner recipe. Originating from the Indian subcontinent, it is sometimes compared with the Parsi dish akuri. The Parsi dish Akoori or Akuri is very similar to egg bhurji with a few differences. Just like bhurji, akuri is filled with many aromatics like ginger, onion and other spices. However, bhurji eggs are cooked until dry, whereas akoori eggs are cooked less while still runny. The difference lies in its preparation and addition of saut\u00e9ed chopped onions, chilies and optional spices.[1] Bhurji can be found at highway rest stops and street food stalls across India, sometimes served alongside slices of white bread.[2][failed verification] Heavy with tomatoes, chilies, onion, and fragrant spices, these scrambled eggs make for a substantial and satisfying meal, in a matter of minutes. Egg bhurji goes well with hot chapati, paratha, dinner rolls or buttered toast.[3]  This Indian cuisine\u2013related article is a stub. You can help Wikipedia by expanding it.

    "Kheer": " Kheer, also known as payasam or payesh, is a pudding or porridge popular in the Indian subcontinent, usually made by boiling milk, sugar or jaggery, and rice. It can be additionally flavoured with dried fruits, nuts, cardamom and saffron. Instead of rice, it may contain cracked wheat, vermicelli (sevai), sago or tapioca (sabudana).[1] In Southern India, it is known as payasam and it is made in various ways. The most popular versions are the ones made with rice and vermicelli (semiya). [1] The word kheer is derived from the Sanskrit word kshira (\u0915\u094d\u0937\u0940\u0930), which means milk or a milk-based dish.[2][3] Kheer is also the archaic name for sweet rice pudding.[4] The word payasam used in South India for kheer originates from the Sanskrit term p\u0101yasa (\u092a\u093e\u092f\u0938), which means \"milk\" or a dish made from milk. This term evolved into various regional languages, including Malayalam (\u0d2a\u0d3e\u0d2f\u0d38\u0d02, p\u0101yasa\u1e41), Telugu (\u0c2a\u0c3e\u0c2f\u0c38\u0c02, p\u0101yasa\u1e41), and Tamil (\u0baa\u0bbe\u0baf\u0b9a\u0bae\u0bcd, p\u0101yacam).[5] It is said to have originated initially in South India thousands of years ago. The story is titled \"The Legend of Chessboard\" in Kerala, an old sage in the form of Krishna challenged the king of Ambalapuzha (chess enthusiasts) to play chess. To motivate the sage, the king offered anything that the sage would name. The sage modestly asked just for a few grains of rice but under one condition: the king has to put a single grain of rice on the first chess square and double it on every subsequent one. Lord Krishna (the sage) won the game and the king started placing the grains. As he stacked them, he was shocked to see the number grow exponentially. In the end, the number came up to trillions. Krishna reveals himself and asks the king to provide kheer to every pilgrim who comes to his temple there. The Ambalapuzha Krishna temple still follows this and it is located in Kerala's Alappuzha district.[6] According to the food historian K. T. Achaya, kheer or payasam, as it is known in southern India, was a popular dish in ancient India. First mentioned in ancient Indian literature, it was a mixture of rice, milk and sugar, a formula that has endured for over two thousand years. Payasam was also a staple Hindu temple food, in particular, and it is served as Pras\u0101da to devotees in temples.[7]",
    "Khichda": "Khichra or Khichda (Urdu: \u06a9\u06be\u0686\u0691\u0627) is a variation of the dish Haleem, popular with Muslims of the Indian subcontinent. Khichra is cooked all year and particularly at the Ashura of Muharram. It is made using goat meat, beef, lentils and spices, slowly cooked to a thick paste.[1] It is the meat-based variant of Khichdi, a rice dish from the Indian subcontinent.[2] In Pakistan, beef Haleem and Khichra is sold as street food in most cities throughout the year.[3][4] Khichra and Haleem are very similar dishes; meat is grounded in Haleem while it is left as chunks in Khichra.[5] The origin of Haleem lies in the popular Arabian dish known as Harees (also written as Jareesh). According to Shoaib Daniyal, writing in The Sunday Guardian, the first written recipe of Harees dates back to the 10th century, when Arab scribe Abu Muhammad al-Muzaffar ibn Sayyar compiled a cookbook of dishes popular with the \"kings and caliphs and lords and leaders\" of Baghdad. \"The version described in his Kitab Al-Tabikh (Book of Recipes), the world\u2019s oldest surviving Arabic cookbook, is strikingly similar to the one people in the Middle East eat to this day\" it reported. Harees was introduced to the city by Arab soldiers of the Nizam's army.[6][7][8] As per the Delhi based historian Sohail Hashmi, the Khichra originated as a famine relief measure in the North Indian city of Lucknow while building the Old Imambara of Lucknow. Due to a famine, the then Nawab of Awadh commenced the construction of an Imambargah, announcing that anyone who participated in the construction would be given free food. This free food consisted of rice slowly cooked with mutton and various pulses, thus becoming rich in protein and carbohydrates. This aided a number of famine affected people who would otherwise have died. Once the construction of the Imambargah was completed, the dish continued to get popular and can today be found not just in Lucknow, but a number of cities of the Indian subcontinent. Travellers took this dish to other parts of the Indian subcontinent, where it further acquired a local flavor.[9] In the Indian subcontinent, both Haleem and Khichra are made with same ingredients. Haleem is cooked until the meat blends with the lentils, while in Khichra chunks of meat remain as cubes.[10][11][12] Khichdi is a vegetarian dish with rice and pulses or lentils.",
    "Kitchree": " Khichdi or khichri (Urdu: \u06a9\u06be\u0686\u0691\u06cc, romanized:\u00a0khic\u1e5b\u012b, Hindi: \u0916\u093f\u091a\u0921\u093c\u0940, romanized:\u00a0khic\u1e5b\u012b, pronounced [\u02c8k\u02b0\u026at\u0283\u027di\u02d0], Bengali: \u0996\u09bf\u099a\u09c1\u09a1\u09bc\u09bf, romanized:\u00a0Khicu\u1e5bi, Odia: \u0b16\u0b47\u0b1a\u0b41\u0b21\u0b3f) is a dish in South Asian cuisine made of rice and lentils (dal) with numerous variations. Variations include bajra and mung dal khichri. In Indian culture, in several regions, especially in the northern areas, it is considered one of the first solid foods that babies eat.[1][2][3] The word Khichd\u012b is derived from Sanskrit \u0916\u093f\u091a\u094d\u091a\u093e khicc\u0101,[4][5] a dish of rice and legumes.[6] Some divergence of transliteration may be noted in the third consonant in the word khic\u1e5b\u012b. The sound is the retroflex flap [\u027d], which is written in Hindi with the Devanagari letter \u27e8\u0921\u093c\u27e9, and in Urdu script with the Perso-Arabic letter \u27e8\u0691\u27e9. In Hindustani phonology, the etymological origin of the retroflex flap was /\u0256/ when it occurred between vowels.[7] Hence in Devanagari the letter \u27e8\u0921\u27e9, representing /\u0256/, was adapted to write /\u027d/ by adding a diacritic under it. In Urdu script, the phonological quality of the flap was represented by adapting the letter \u27e8\u0631\u27e9, representing /r/, with a diacritic added above it to indicate the retroflex quality. The occurrence of this consonant in the word khic\u1e5b\u012b has given rise to two alternative spellings in English: khichri, which reflects its phonology, and khichdi, which reflects its etymology. The Greek king Seleucus during his campaign in India (305-303 BC), mentioned that rice with pulses is very popular among people of the Indian subcontinent.[3] Strabo also notes that Indian food mainly consisted of rice porridge and a beverage made of rice, presently called arak.[8] The Moroccan traveler Ibn Battuta mentions khichdi as a dish in India composed of rice and mung beans, during his stay around 1350.[9] khichdi is described in the writings of Afanasiy Nikitin, a Russian adventurer who travelled to the Indian subcontinent in the 15th century. It was very popular with the Mughals, especially Jahangir. Ain-i-Akbari, a 16th-century document written by Mughal Emperor Akbar's vizier, Abu'l Fadl, mentions the recipe for khichdi, which gives seven variations.[10] There is an anecdotal story about khichdi featuring Akbar and his court advisor, Birbal.[11] The Anglo-Indian dish kedgeree is thought to derive from khichri.[12][13] Khichdi is a very popular dish across the Indian subcontinent which consists of, Bangladesh, Pakistan, Nepal and Sri Lanka. The dish is also widely prepared in many Indian states, such as Punjab, Haryana, Rajasthan, Karnataka, Telangana, Madhya Pradesh, Gujarat, Tamil Nadu, Andhra Pradesh, West Bengal, Assam, Bihar, Jharkhand, Uttar Pradesh, Odisha, and Maharashtra.[14] Vegetables such as cauliflower, potato, and green peas are commonly added.[citation needed] Hindus, mainly from north/northwest, who avoid eating grains during fasting, eat Sabudana khichri made from sago.[15][16] In the southern part of India, however, the word khichri is not that popular. While people of Tamil Nadu and Andhra regions cook Pongal, and Kannadigas prepare Huggi which is mung dal khichdi and Bisi bele bhath, a pigeon pea variation with vegetables, Keralites have no similar dish.[citation needed] Khichdi was the inspiration for Anglo-Indian kedgeree[12][17] Khichdi is a popular traditional staple in Haryana, specially in the rural areas. Haryanvi khichdi is made from pearl millet and mung dal (split mung bean) pounded in mortar (unkhal), and often eaten by mixing with warm ghee or lassi, or even yogurt.[18][19][20][21] Sometimes, jowar is also mixed with bajra and mung dal.[21] The Hyderabadi Muslim community, of the erstwhile Hyderabad State, in present-day Telangana, Marathwada, and Kalyana-Karnataka regions, make khichdi as a common breakfast dish, and is an important part of Hyderabadi cuisine.[22] The dish is called khichri, kheema, khatta, or other switch-around versions of the previous, named after the three parts of the meal, Khichri, ground beef, and a sour sauce, made of tamarind and sesame.[23] Khichra is similar to haleem, a meat dish, while khichra is a vegetarian dish with rice and pulses or lentils, with no spices.[24] In 2017, Indian media unofficially designated it as the \"national dish\", as it is being globally promoted by the government of India as \"queen of all foods\". The report that the government may designate khichri as India's \"national dish\" brought significant ridicule from the opposition politicians.[25] However, India's Minister of Food Processing Industries Harsimrat Kaur Badal clarified that while Khichdi is considered nutritious and healthy food in India, the government did not have any plans to designate a national food.[26][27][28] Khichdi has lent its name to media synonymous with ensembles or potpourri as depicted in the popular culture through movies such as Khichdi: The Movie, and TV sitcoms such as Khichdi and Instant Khichdi. The dish has been cooked at both MasterChef Australia[29] and America.[1]",
    "Korma": "Korma or qorma (Urdu: \u0642\u0648\u0631\u0645\u06c1; Hindi: \u0915\u093c\u094b\u0930\u092e\u093e; Bengali: \u0995\u09cb\u09b0\u09ae\u09be; Persian: \u0642\u0631\u0645\u0627) is a dish with its origin in the Indian subcontinent,[1] consisting of meat or vegetables braised with yogurt, water or stock, and spices to produce a thick sauce or gravy.[2] The English name is an anglicisation of the Hindi-Urdu qorm\u0101 (\u0915\u093c\u094b\u0930\u092e\u093e, \u0642\u0648\u0631\u0645\u06c1), meaning \"braise\".[3][4] It refers to the cooking technique used in the dish.[2][5] All these words, and the names of dishes such as the Iranian ghormeh (Persian: \u0642\u0648\u0631\u0645\u0647), Turkish Kavurma and the Azerbaijani qovurma or kavarma, are ultimately derived from a Turkic word qawirma, meaning \"[a] fried thing\".[4] The Indian korma is, however, possibly unrelated in a culinary sense to the modern Turkish kavurma or to some other dishes using the same root word, as they use widely varying techniques and ingredients.[6] Korma has its roots in the Mughlai cuisine[1] of the Indian subcontinent. A characteristic Mughal dish, it can be traced back to the 16th century and to the Mughal expansion into South Asia. Kormas were often prepared in the Mughal court kitchens, such as the famous white korma, perhaps garnished with vark, was said to have been served to Shah Jahan and his guests at the inauguration of the Taj Mahal.[7] Classically, a korma is defined as a dish where meat or vegetables are braised with yogurt or stock. The technique covers many different styles of korma. The flavour of a korma is based on the mixture of spices, including ground coriander and cumin, combined with yogurt kept below curdling temperature and incorporated slowly and carefully with the meat juices. Traditionally, this would have been carried out in a pot set over a very low fire, with charcoal on the lid to provide all-round heat. A korma can be mildly spiced or fiery and may use lamb, goat meat, chicken, beef or game; some kormas combine meat and vegetables, such as spinach and turnip. The term shahi (English: royal), used for some kormas, indicates its status as a prestige dish, rather than an everyday meal, and its association with the court. The korma style is similar to other braising techniques in that the meat or vegetable is first cooked briskly, or seared, using high heat, traditionally with ghee, and then subjected to long, slow cooking using moist heat and a minimum of added liquid.[2] The pot may be sealed with dough during the last stages of cooking, using a technique called dum or dampokhtak.[2] The korma is made using a technique called bagar. in the later stage of cooking, additional spices are mixed with heated ghee and then combined with the sauce formed by the braising. The pan is then covered and shaken to release steam and mix the contents.[8] There is a wide variation between individual korma and other \"curry\" recipes. Chilli and ginger are often used, but the precise method of preparation results in widely different flavors. Indian bay leaves or dried coconut may be added, the latter being a predominantly South Indian flavoring. A korma pilau (pilaf) is a rice and meat dish made with braised meat.[9] In the United Kingdom, a typical korma as served in curry houses is a mildly spiced dish with a thick sauce. It often features almonds, cashews or other nuts, and coconut or coconut milk. In the 21st century, chicken korma has several times been cited as the most popular curry in the UK, replacing chicken tikka masala in surveys of public eating habits.[10][11] Navratan korma is a vegetarian korma made with vegetables and either paneer (an Indian cheese) or nuts \u2013 or sometimes both.[12] Navratan means \"nine gems\", and it is common for the recipe to include nine different vegetables. In some parts of South Asia, korma is used to denote a traditional Eid al-Adha (festival of the sacrifice) dish of lamb, goat, or cow that is braised in minimal or no spices. The flavour comes from the meat and fat of the chosen cuts. It was often done to preserve meats for a short-term period, as the fat layer forms a barrier to help prevent spoilage, similar to potted beef. In Malaysia, korma or 'gulai kurma' is traditionally cooked with coconut milk instead of yoghurt among the Malays, as dairy products do not feature heavily in Malay cuisine. Meats used for kurma include chicken, mutton, beef, and deer. It also often contains more vegetables, such as carrots, potatoes, and tomatoes, though this is not a hard-and-fast rule. Some recipes include tamarind as the souring agent, in place of the natural acidity of yoghurt.[13]",
    "Kosambari": " Kosambari, Kosumalli or Koshambari is a typical South Indian salad made from pulses (split legumes), cucumber and seasoned with mustard seeds.[1] The pulses generally used are split green gram (hesaru bele in Kannada).[2] These salads are sometimes eaten as snacks, but usually as a part of full course meal. Its regional variation in northern India is known as kachumber while in northeastern India, it is known as singju. Traditionally, kosambari is made of cucumber, mung bean, and coriander. Optionally, ash gournd, green mango, and carrots are also used in some recipes. Kosambari is tempered with sesame oil, mustard seeds, curry leaves, lemon juice, salt and asafoetida for seasoning.[3] Kosambari is also made from split chickpea.[4] In Tamil Nadu, Kosumalli is made with Cucumber,  Carrot or Banana Stem. Kosambari is distributed during festivals and on special occasions.[5] It is distributed to masses during Ganesha Chaturthi and Sri Rama Navami. During Varamahalakshmi and Gowri festivals women invite each other and exchange kosambari along with turmeric and vermilion to celebrate divinity in the feminine.",
    "Kulfi": "  Kulfi (/k\u028alfi\u02d0/) is a frozen dairy dessert from the Indian subcontinent. It is often described as \"traditional Indian ice cream\".[3] Kulfi originated in 16th-century Delhi during the Mughal era. It is part of the national cuisines of India and Pakistan.[citation needed] It is also popular in Bangladesh, Myanmar, Nepal, Sri Lanka, and the Middle East.[4][better\u00a0source\u00a0needed] Kulfi is denser and creamier than regular ice cream.[3][4][5] It comes in various flavours. Traditional ones include cream (malai), rose, mango, cardamom (elaichi), saffron (kesar or zafran), and pistachio.[4][6][better\u00a0source\u00a0needed] Newer flavours may include apple, orange, strawberry, peanut, or avocado.[4][better\u00a0source\u00a0needed] Unlike ice cream, kulfi is not churned while it is frozen, resulting in a denser final product which is considered a distinct category of frozen dairy-based dessert.[5] The density of kulfi causes it to melt more slowly than ice cream.[7] The word kulfi comes from the Persian qulfi (\u0642\u0644\u0641\u06cc) meaning \"covered cup\". The dessert originated in Delhi during the Mughal Empire in the 16th century.[1][2][8] The mixture of dense evaporated milk was already popular in the sweet dishes in the Indian subcontinent. During the Mughal period, this mixture was flavoured with pistachios and saffron, packed into metal cones and immersed in slurry ice, resulting in the invention of kulfi. Ain-i-Akbari, a detailed record of the Mughal emperor Akbar's administration, mentions use of saltpeter for refrigeration as well as transportation of Himalayan ice to warmer areas.[1][8] Although Delhi has been described as the birthplace of kulfi, Australian food historian Charmaine O'Brien suggests, \"...it is likely that [kulfi] originally evolved in the cooler climates of Persia or Samarkand and that the Mughals appropriated the concept and elaborated on it to create the creamy, perfumed dessert that it now is.\"[2] To prepare kulfi, sweetened, flavoured milk is slow cooked. The milk is stirred almost continuously to prevent it from sticking to the cooking utensil. During this process, the milk condenses and thickens.[9] The slow cooking caramelises the sugar in the mixture and browns its milk proteins, giving kulfi its distinctive taste.[6][10] The mixture is then poured into moulds (often kulhars) and sealed. The sealed moulds are submerged in an insulated matka filled with ice and salt. This quickly freezes the mixture, giving it a soft, smooth consistency free of ice crystals. Kulfi prepared in this traditional way is called matka kulfi.[11] The moulds are removed from the freezer 10\u201315 minutes before serving to allow the kulfi to melt slightly. The kulfi is then removed from the moulds and garnished with ground cardamom, saffron, or pistachios. Kulfi is also served with falooda (vermicelli noodles).[12] Throughout the Indian subcontinent, kulfi is sold by street vendors known as kulfiwallahs. It is also commonly served in Indian restaurants.[13]",

    "Lamb Curry": "Mutton curry (also referred to as kosha mangsho,[1]  lamb curry,[2] or goat curry[3][4]) is a dish that is prepared from goat meat (or sometimes lamb meat) and vegetables.[5] The dish is found in different variations across all states, countries and regions of the Indian subcontinent and the Caribbean. Mutton curry was originally prepared putting all the ingredients together in a earthen pot and slow cooking the whole curry by wood fire on a clay oven.[6] Today it is cooked using pressure cookers and slow cookers after briefly saut\u00e9ing all the ingredients and spices in a big wok.[6] The steadily cooked mutton becomes more tender than normally cooked mutton. Mutton curry is generally served with rice or with Indian breads, such as naan or parotta.[7] The dish can also be served with ragi, a cereal.[8] Common ingredients used to prepare mutton curry[9] include: mutton or goat meat, salt, turmeric powder, mustard oil, ginger garlic paste, dahi (yogurt), assortment of spices, onion, chilli, tomato, and coriander leaves.[10] In Odisha, mutton curry is always made of khasi goat meat (meat of young castrated male goat). There are many varieties of goat meat curries prepared in Odisha. Simple and flavorful ingredients are used to prepare the curry and usually served with roti, naan or in Western Odisha, puffed rice (mudhi). Some of the popular curries are:[11] While mutton curry is usually eaten with rice, in Western Odisha, Mangsa Kash\u0101 is particularly relished with mudhi (puffed rice). Mangsa Kash\u0101 is said to be the predecessor of the popular Bengali goat curry dish known as Kosha Mangsho most probably introduced by the Odia cooks who moved to West Bengal during the British rule to work in the kitchens of Bengali families.[12] Mutton is typically cooked in Bihar in curried form. In addition to fish and chicken, mutton is common in Bihari cuisine. Mutton curry is traditionally served with Malpua on Holi,[13] while it is eaten with rice in a routine everyday meal. In Champaran, mutton is cooked in a sealed earthen pot as a one-pot curry.[14] Mutton curry has a special place in Surati cuisine. A rich mutton dish known as Tapelu which finds its origins in the kitchens of the Surati Khatri community, is often cooked in large batches, especially during festivities.[15] [16] Goat offal also finds a place in the cuisine of Surat.[15] Kosha mangsho is the Bengali version of mutton curry. It traditionally has less juice and more gravy than mutton curries eaten in other parts of India.[17] This dish is prepared in a kosha style, which involves retaining the mutton's flavor and moisture using slow cooking and saut\u00e9eing methods.[18] Kosha mangsho is traditionally prepared as part of the celebration of Kali Puja,[19] a festival dedicated to the Hindu goddess Kali, celebrated on the New Moon day of the Hindu month Kartik. Railway mutton curry is a British Raj colonial-era dish that was served on long-distance trains.[20][21][22] The dish was served with dinner rolls.[20] Tamarind was originally used to extend its shelf life.[20] Some restaurants serve the dish in present-day times, such as Oh! Calcutta! restaurant in Kolkata, India.[23][24] Railway mutton curry is prepared using a coconut milk base.[24] Black Mutton curry (also referred to as konkani black mutton) is a dish that is prepared from goat or lamb meat, charred coconuts, and a signature spice blend. The regional dish originated in the Konkani[25] district of Maharashtra, India. Black Mutton curry was originally made by preparing a black spice paste consisting of charred coconuts, onions and peppers with spices which was then cooked low and slow in a cast iron wok. The cooked paste was added with the mutton along with fresh herbs and spices in an earthen pot and cooked low and slow till tender. The curry is typically served with breads such as Bhakari, Chapati, Pav or rice. The dish utilizes a unique blend of spices called the Maharashtrian garam masala, which consists of cardamom, nutmeg, khus khus (poppy seeds), saunth (dried ginger), and many other Mughlai spices which lend the black mouton an intoxicating flavor and a robust color.[26] In 2012, in the Midlands, England, trading standards officers working undercover went to twenty restaurants that were randomly chosen and bought 39 lamb curry and kebab dishes.[27] Four of the dishes contained no lamb, instead using a mixture that contained beef, pork or chicken.[27] In the investigation, it was found that only three lamb curries out of the nineteen tested contained only lamb. Most were found to consist of a mixture of lamb with beef or chicken.[27] Additionally, all of the twenty lamb kebabs that were sampled contained meats in addition to lamb that was mixed with it, such as beef, pork or chicken.[27] Hot",
    "Lamb Saag": "Saag (Hindustani: [\u02c8s\u0251\u02d0g]), also spelled sag or saga, is an Indian subcontinental leafy vegetable dish eaten with bread, such as roti or naan,[1][2] or in some regions with rice. Saag can be made from mustard greens, collard greens, basella or finely chopped broccoli along with added spices and sometimes other ingredients, such as chhena. In India, it is common, especially in the state of Odisha, where it is eaten with pakhala. In the Shree Jagannath Temple of Puri, saag is one of the dishes offered to Jagannath as part of Mahaprasad. Saag is also common in West Bengal and other regions of North India, where the most common preparation is sarson ka saag (mustard plant leaves), which may be eaten with makki ki roti, a yellow roti made with maize flour.[3] Saag gosht or hariyali maans (spinach and mutton) is a common dish in the North Indian state of Punjab.[4] In Pakistan, it is most commonly eaten in the Punjab province along with Makki ki roti and fresh cow butter or Desi ghee. The word saag is derived from the Sanskrit word shaak (\u015b\u0101ka) meaning leafy green vegetables.[5] In Odia cuisine, s\u0101ga (Odia: \u0b36\u0b3e\u0b17) is one of the most important vegetables. It is popular all over the state. A large variety of plants are used as s\u0101ga in Odisha. A list of the plants that are used as s\u0101ga is as below. In Bengali cuisine, s\u0101g is one of the most important vegetables, being popular throughout the state. Most Bengalis eat at least one dish containing s\u0101g at lunchtime every day - usually fried or accompanied by a little gravy (jhol) and served with rice. A list of the plants that are used as s\u0101g is as below. [8] There are around 70 varieties of saag in Jharkhand.[9] Some are as follows: Saags (Leafy greens) are an important part of the Garhwali, Kumaoni and Jaunsari cuisines of Uttarakhand. The abundance of leafy greens in the state is because of fertile land and forested land. Saags of Sarson (Mustard), Palak (spinach), Mooli (Radish) are common[10] but exclusive saags cooked in the state are:",
    "Lemon Rice": " Chitranna (Kannada: \u0c9a\u0cbf\u0ca4\u0ccd\u0cb0\u0cbe\u0ca8\u0ccd\u0ca8), also known as Lemon rice, is a rice-based dish widely prepared in South India. It is prepared by mixing cooked rice with a special seasoning called Oggarane or Gojju. Characteristic for the seasoning are mustard seeds, fried lentils, peanuts, curry leaves, chillies, lemon juice and other optional items such as  scrapes of unripe mango. Added turmeric powder gives Chitranna its yellow color. Garlic and onions are also used in the seasoning by some, although traditionally they do not form part of the recipe.\nThe dish is especially popular in the south Indian state of Karnataka, where it has become a part of the daily diet. Chitranna rice dish finds its mention in medieval Indian cookbooks Manasollasa (1130 CE) and Pakadarpana (1200 CE) as \"Chitrapaka\".[1] Depending on the ingredients, various types of Chitranna can be prepared:  This Indian cuisine\u2013related article is a stub.

    "Lemonade": "This is an accepted version of this page   Lemonade is a sweetened lemon-flavored drink. There are varieties of lemonade found throughout the world.[1] In North America and South Asia, lemonade is typically non-carbonated and non-clarified (called \"cloudy lemonade\" in British English, or lemon squash in Australian English). It is traditionally a homemade drink using lemon juice, water, and a sweetener such as cane sugar, simple syrup, maple syrup or honey.[2] In the United Kingdom, Ireland, Central Europe, South Africa, Australia, and New Zealand, a carbonated lemonade soft drink is more common. Despite the differences between the drinks, each is known simply as \"lemonade\" in countries where it is dominant. The suffix \"-ade\" may also be applied to other similar drinks made with different fruits, such as limeade, orangeade, or cherryade.[3] A drink made with lemons, dates, and honey was consumed in Mamluk Egypt, including a lemon juice drink with sugar, known as qatarmizat.[4] In 1676, a company known as Compagnie de Limonadiers sold lemonade in Paris.[5] Vendors carried tanks of lemonade on their backs and dispensed cups of the soft drink to Parisians.[6] While carbonated water was invented by Joseph Priestley in 1767 (with his pamphlet Directions for Impregnating Water with Fixed Air published in London in 1772),[7] the first reference found to carbonated lemonade was in 1833 when the drink was sold in British refreshment stalls.[8] R. White's Lemonade has been sold in the UK since 1845.[9] The predominant form of lemonade found in the US, Canada, and India, cloudy lemonade, also known as traditional or old fashioned lemonade in the UK and Australia, is non-carbonated and made with fresh lemon juice; however, commercially produced varieties are also available. Generally served cold, cloudy lemonade may also be served hot as a remedy for congestion and sore throats,[10] frozen, or used as a mixer. Traditionally, children in US and Canadian neighborhoods start lemonade stands to make money during summer. The concept has become iconic of youthful summertime Americana to the degree that parodies and variations exist across media. References can be found in comics and cartoons such as Peanuts, and the 1979 computer game Lemonade Stand.[11] A popular variation of traditional lemonade, pink lemonade, is created by adding additional fruit juices, flavors, or food coloring to the recipe. Most store-bought pink lemonade is simply colored with concentrated grape juice or dyes.[12]  Among those using natural colors, grape is the most popular, but cranberry juice, beet juice or syrup made from brightly colored fruits and vegetables such as rhubarb, raspberries, strawberries, or cherries are also used.[13] The origin stories generally associate pink lemonade's invention with traveling circuses in the US.[13]  A 1912 obituary credited the invention of pink lemonade to circus worker Henry E. \"Sanchez\" Allott, saying he had dropped in red cinnamon candies by mistake.[14]  Another origin story credits another circus worker, Pete Conklin, in 1857. His brother, lion tamer George Conklin, tells the story in his 1921 memoir, The Ways of the Circus.[13] According to the story, Conklin's lemonade was a mixture of water, sugar and tartaric acid, with the tub garnished with a single lemon that he repeatedly used for the season.  One day, he ran out of water. Searching desperately, he found a tub of water a bareback rider had recently used to rinse her pink tights. Adding in the sugar, acid and remaining bits of lemon, he offered the resulting mixture as \"strawberry lemonade\" and saw his sales double.[12][15] Real lemons were too expensive for the circus, so artificial substitutes were widely used.[13]  In the past, tartaric acid was commonly used to produce the typical tart flavor.[13]  In the modern era, commercially produced lemonade and powdered mixes tend to rely on citric acid.[13] Though not the term's primary meaning, \"pink lemonade\" can also describe[16][17][18][19][20] \"Indian lemonade\", or lemonade made by soaking dried sumac berries, especially berries of species like Rhus typhina (\"staghorn sumac\"),[21] Rhus aromatica (\"fragrant sumac\", \"lemon sumac\"),[22] Rhus glabra (\"smooth sumac\", \"scarlet sumac\"),[23][24] or Rhus integrifolia (\"lemonade sumac\", \"lemonade berry\");[25] Indian lemonade has a similar pinkish color. The predominant form of lemonade in the UK, Ireland, France, Germany, Switzerland, South Africa and Australia is a clear, lemon-flavoured carbonated beverage. Schweppes, Kirks, R. White's Lemonade and C&C are common brands, and shops usually carry a store-branded lemonade as well.[9] Schweppes uses a blend of lemon and lime oils.[26] Other fizzy drinks, soft-drinks (or pop) which are both lemon and lime flavoured may also sometimes be referred to as lemonade, such as Sprite and 7 Up. There are also speciality flavours, such as Fentimans Rose Lemonade, which is sold in the UK, the US, and Canada. Shandy, a mixture of beer and clear lemonade, is often sold pre-bottled, or ordered in pubs.[27] There are various drinks called brown lemonade. In Northern Ireland, brown lemonade is flavoured with brown sugar.[28] A variant from Venezuela has cane sugar and lime.[29] In India and Pakistan, where it is commonly known as nimbu paani, and in Bangladesh, lemonades may also contain salt or ginger juice called lebur shorbot.[30] Shikanjvi is a traditional lemonade from this region, and can also be flavored with saffron, cumin and other spices.[31][32][33] Limonana, a type of lemonade made from freshly squeezed lemon juice and mint leaves, is a common summer drink in the Middle East.[34] In Northern Africa, a drink called cherbat is made of lemon, mint, and rose water.[citation needed] Switcha is a version of the drink made in the Bahamas and Turks & Caicos that can also be made with limes instead of lemons.[citation needed] In France, it is common for bars or restaurants to offer citron press\u00e9, also called citronnade, an unmixed version of lemonade in which the customer is given lemon juice, syrup and water separately to be mixed in their preferred proportions.[35]",
    "Litti": " Jari Olavi Litmanen (pronounced [\u02c8j\u0251ri \u02c8litm\u0251nen] \u24d8; born 20 February 1971) is a Finnish former professional footballer who played as an attacking midfielder or a second striker. He was the first-choice captain of the Finland national team between 1996 and 2008 in an international career that ran from 1989 to 2010. Litmanen is widely considered to be Finland's greatest football player of all time.[3] He was chosen as the best Finnish player of the last 50 years by the Football Association of Finland in the UEFA Jubilee Awards in November 2003. He also finished 42nd in the 100 Greatest Finns voting in 2004. The Association of Football Statisticians' (The AFS) compendium of 'Greatest Ever Footballers' listed Litmanen as the 53rd best footballer ever.[4] In Finland, he is often called \"Litti\" (after his own surname), which dates from his early years, and is also known as \"Kuningas\" (\"The King\"). During his club career, Litmanen represented Reipas, HJK, MyPa and Lahti in Finland, and Ajax, Barcelona, Liverpool, Hansa Rostock and Malm\u00f6 FF abroad. Once considered one of the best attacking midfielders in the world,[5] he became the first Finnish footballing superstar while playing for Ajax in the mid-1990s, winning the Champions League in 1995, the peak year of his career. His later career was marred by injuries, and he was unable to repeat the success of his Ajax years either at Barcelona or Liverpool, often finding himself on the bench, despite some impressive performances for the latter. Writing about Litmanen in 2009, Paul Simpson, former FourFourTwo editor, went as far as to assert that \"his career has not been worthy of his talent\".[6] Litmanen made his first-team debut for Reipas in Finland's then top division Mestaruussarja at the age of 16 in 1987. After four seasons with Reipas, he moved to HJK, Finland's biggest club, in 1991. A year later, he joined MyPa, where he was coached by Harri Kampman, who later introduced him to his agent, the late Heikki Marttinen. Litmanen did not win any medals in the Finnish league, but he did win the Finnish Cup with MyPa in July 1992 in a 2\u20130 win over FF Jaro in the final at the Helsinki Olympic Stadium. His performance in the cup final, including a goal, convinced a scout of Ajax that the club should sign him. \"For me, he was the player,\" the scout later told Finnish television. His transfer took place during the same summer, and he did not complete the Finnish football season with MyPa. Louis Van Gaal, the manager of Ajax at the time, later stated that Ajax paid a transfer fee of only \u00a310,000 for Litmanen.[7] However, the original fax document was later revealed in Finnish media, according to which the transfer fee was 100,000 + 800,000 Dutch guilder, which corresponds roughly to \u20ac550,000.[8] Before his move to Ajax, Litmanen had failed to earn a contract with the Romanian club Dinamo Bucure\u0219ti. A number of European clubs, including Barcelona, Leeds United and PSV,[9] had shown an interest in him, but in the end it was Ajax that bought him. David Endt, who was Ajax team manager in the 1990s, described his first impression of Litmanen to the Finnish broadcasting corporation YLE in 2010:[10] The press conference is over, and in comes Jari Litmanen, from behind the door. And I looked at his face and I looked at his eyes, and I recognised something in those eyes. And I thought, this is a man with a great willpower. Because he was not shy, not timid, but he was modest. He is not a man who will raise his voice, or bang with his fist on the table and say, 'We do it this way'. No, he was more of a diplomat, not wanting to be a leader, but being a leader. \u2026 He wanted to know everything about football, he was interested in every part of the game, and this gave him the nickname, within the team, we called him the 'Professor', because you could ask anything about football, and he would know the answer. During 1992\u201393, his first season at Ajax, he played mostly in the reserves. Then Ajax manager Louis van Gaal was apparently not overly impressed with him, but the team physiotherapist suggested using him as a stand-in for Dennis Bergkamp, who was injured at the time. Van Gaal liked what he saw, and knowing that Bergkamp was about to leave for Inter, he announced that Litmanen would be Bergkamp's successor, something that people in Litmanen's native Finland found difficult to believe.[10] This turned out to be true, however, and he inherited from Bergkamp the famous number 10 shirt, which is often given to playmakers. He went on to score 26 goals in the 1993\u201394 season, becoming the league's top scorer, and leading Ajax to the title. He was also voted Footballer of the Year in the Netherlands in 1993. Litmanen was one of the star players of Van Gaal's team that won three consecutive Dutch championships and reached the UEFA Champions League final twice in a row. From the beginning of the 1994\u201395 season to the middle of the 1995\u201396 season, Ajax went undefeated in both the Eredivisie (a run of 52 games) and the Champions League (19 games). When Ajax beat Milan in the 1995 Champions League final, Litmanen became the first Finnish player to win the Champions League. In the 1995\u201396 edition of the Champions League, he was the Champions League top scorer with nine goals, including the equaliser in the final against Juventus, which Ajax lost on penalties. In 1995, he also won the Intercontinental Cup against Gr\u00eamio and came third in the voting for the Ballon d'Or (European Footballer of the Year), having finished eighth the previous year. Litmanen spent seven years in Amsterdam, winning four Dutch championships and three KNVB Cups, and scored a total of 129 goals, 91 of them in the league. He is the club's top scorer in European competition with 26 goals in 54 matches (including two goals scored in the 2002\u201303 season). Litmanen has the honour of being one of just three players presented in a special video featurette at the Ajax Museum. The other two are Marco van Basten and Johan Cruyff. Frank Rijkaard, Litmanen's teammate in the 1993\u201394 and 1994\u201395 seasons, once said, \"Dennis Bergkamp was brilliant for Ajax but the best No.10 we ever had was Jari.\" In his time at Ajax, some fans called him \"Merlin\" because of the magic he brought to the pitch. But his proneness to injury also earned Litmanen the name \"The Man of Glass\", and injuries hampered his later seasons at Ajax causing him to miss many games (in his six seasons as a regular first-team player, he missed 57 out of a total of 204 league games, and in his last three seasons, he missed seven out of 24 European matches, playing only part of five others). His injury problems were to worsen as time passed, undermining his subsequent career. In 1999, Litmanen was reunited with Louis van Gaal at Barcelona, one of several former Ajax players recruited by Van Gaal in his time as manager. Litmanen's stint with the club was largely plagued by injuries. An article in The Observer in April 2000 likened him to Pope John Paul II, in that he was \"making few appearances and looking more frail each time\".[11] Litmanen also failed to adapt to his new conditions, and he was one of the players dropped by Van Gaal that winter. Van Gaal later expressed his disappointment with Litmanen at Barcelona:[12] Players count for nothing, the team is everything. I set more store by a player's character than by his on-field qualities, and particularly whether he is willing to give everything to the cause. There are some incredibly talented players who haven't got the character or the personality to suit my methods. Litmanen, for example, was a different player at Barca than he was at Ajax. You have to adapt to a new culture when you move to a different club, and not every player is able to do that. After an unsuccessful season, Van Gaal was replaced by Lorenzo Serra Ferrer, and Litmanen was frozen out of the team, losing the number 10 shirt to Rivaldo, although he remained at the club until January 2001, when he moved to Liverpool on a free transfer. \"We have signed a world-class player. He comes with a massive reputation and I believe he's one of the most exciting signings we have made,\" said Liverpool manager G\u00e9rard Houllier after the transfer had been completed.[13] Litmanen also expressed his pleasure with the move: \"It has always been my dream to play for Liverpool. I have supported them since I was a child and there has been talk about me joining them before.\"[14] He wanted to wear the number seven shirt as worn by his boyhood hero Kenny Dalglish, but this had already been taken by Vladim\u00edr \u0160micer. As shirt numbers 17 and 27 were also in use, he settled for the number 37. Litmanen made a good start at Liverpool but broke his wrist playing for Finland against England at Anfield in late March 2001 and missed the rest of the season. Although he was part of the Liverpool team that won the treble of the League Cup, FA Cup and UEFA Cup in 2001, he missed all three finals because of injury. The following season, he was used sparingly by Houllier but did score goals against Tottenham Hotspur, Arsenal, Aston Villa and Fulham in the Premier League and against Dynamo Kyiv, Roma and Bayer Leverkusen in the Champions League.[15] According to his profile on LFCHistory.net, \"Litmanen had difficulties in training due to his ankle problems and was hardly able to play for ninety minutes week in and week out.\" Litmanen himself was frustrated by his lack of playing time at Liverpool:[13] Litmanen was puzzled by Houllier's treatment of him. 'It's strange that he was so pleased when he signed me and then decided to not use me. I cannot explain it myself.' Houllier's explanations made his reasons even more puzzling. 'I let Jari go because I have always believed he had great potential which could benefit other teams. When we had some difficult moments, he was there for us, notably with goals against Fulham, Sunderland, AS Roma and in other crucial games. He had a lack of opportunities in the team but I really liked the reaction of the Ajax players towards Jari when I sold him!' Litmanen was again given permission to move clubs for free after the 2001\u201302 season, having scored a total of 9 goals in 43 official matches during his one and a half seasons at the club. Litmanen decided to return to Ajax, and was given a hero's welcome with the crowd again singing his name. He was one of the key players as Ajax reached the quarter-finals of the 2002\u201303 Champions League, but he continued to be plagued by injuries, and much of the following season was once again spent on the sidelines. In the spring of 2004, the club released him from his contract. Litmanen's return to Finland, where he joined Lahti, was much hyped and was hailed as \"the return of the king\".[16] Litmanen, however, moved to German Bundesliga strugglers Hansa Rostock in January 2005, but he was unable to prevent them being relegated, which ended his stint at the club. Litmanen joined the Swedish club Malm\u00f6 FF in July 2005 in an attempt to help them qualify for the Champions League. This attempt, however, failed, and Litmanen himself was injured during the whole of the autumn, only making a few appearances. He decided to continue his career with Malm\u00f6 in 2006 but was again sidelined with a number of injuries for much of the season. However, the matches he did play showed he remained a brilliant player when fit. After an operation to repair a damaged ankle during the winter break, Malm\u00f6 decided to extend his contract over the 2007 season, but an ankle injury suffered in June 2007 forced Litmanen to cancel it.[17] In January 2008, Litmanen received a ten-day trial invitation from Fulham under former Finland manager Roy Hodgson,[18] and was signed on 31 January 2008 together with fellow countryman Toni Kallio.[19] Just weeks after signing with Fulham, Litmanen had to return to his native Finland to rest, after serious heart concerns.[20] Litmanen eventually made his debut for Fulham in a reserve-team match against Tottenham on 31 March 2008, but he was released in May of the same year without playing a single game for the first team.[21] On 8 August 2008, it was announced that Litmanen would join his former club Lahti of the Finnish Premier Division for the remainder of the 2008 season. Although he only played 34 minutes in his first match, he scored twice and provided the passes for two other goals. He played an important role in helping Lahti to finish third in the league and qualify for Europe for the first time in the club's history. He signed a new one-year contract with Lahti on 16 April 2009. Litmanen scored his first European goal for Lahti in a 2\u20130 win against Gorica in the second qualifying round of the Europa League, with the final aggregate score being 2\u20131. This was his 30th goal in 83 European matches. On 18 September 2010, he scored a bicycle kick goal against Oulu in a 2\u20131 away victory. On 23 October 2010, he scored his 50th Veikkausliiga goal, but this happened in a 3\u20132 defeat against TPS and didn't stop the club from being relegated to Ykk\u00f6nen. On 20 April 2011, Litmanen signed a one-year contract with the reigning Finnish champions HJK at age 40, making him one of the few footballers to play at professional level in four different decades (1980s\u20132010s).[22] He usually started as a substitute and played for 10\u201330 minutes. The HJK coach Antti Muurinen described Litmanen as something akin to a \"precision munition\" for HJK. He played in this role on 24 September 2011 in the Finnish Cup final against KuPS, coming on in the 80th minute when the score was 0\u20130. During the second half of extra time, he scored a spectacular half volley to make it 1\u20130 to HJK in the 108th minute. They went on to win the match 2\u20131. This was Litmanen's first Finnish Cup final after winning it with MyPa in 1992. On 2 October 2011, HJK secured their third consecutive Finnish championship, thus winning the Double. As of that day, Litmanen had played 18 matches for HJK that season, and they had won every single match in which he had been on the field. On 14 October 2011, this run ended when HJK drew 0\u20130 with JJK Jyv\u00e4skyl\u00e4. On 29 October 2011, Litmanen celebrated his 200th league match by giving three assists in HJK's 5\u20132 home win over Haka. It was also his last game of the season and would prove to be the last of his professional career. Litmanen is Finland's most capped player and was Finland's leading goalscorer until 12 October 2021, when Teemu Pukki broke the record with two goals against Kazakhstan in a World Cup qualifier.[23] His international career ran for 21 years from 1989 to 2010. Litmanen made his Finland debut on 22 October 1989 against Trinidad and Tobago, and scored his first goal on 16 May 1991 against Malta. Litmanen served as Finland's captain from 1996 to 2008, and was arguably their key player for more than a decade, helping the team to many unexpected victories against higher ranked opposition.[citation needed] Litmanen earned his 100th cap on 25 January 2006 against South Korea, one of only four Finns to have reached such a milestone, the others being Ari Hjelm, Sami Hyypi\u00e4 and Jonatan Johansson. When he played for Finland against South Korea on 19 January 2010, Litmanen became one of a handful of male players to represent a national team in four different decades,[24] a feat matched by Andorra's Ildefons Lima in June 2021.[25] On 17 November 2010, Litmanen became the oldest player ever to score for Finland \u2013 and also the oldest player overall to score a goal in the qualifying stages for the UEFA European Championship \u2013 when he netted a penalty in an 8\u20130 win over San Marino, which proved to be his last international match. In February 2011, the sports news programme Urheiluruutu of the Finnish Broadcasting Company YLE interviewed two of Litmanen's former teammates about the possibility of his working for Ajax when he decides to end his playing career. Former Ajax captain Danny Blind said the following:[26] Jari knows the door is always open for him as an assistant coach, as a youth coach, whatever in the club. We love Jari, and we know his qualities as a football player, but also as a coach, I think, so the door is always open for him. Michel Kreek of the Ajax Academy was equally positive about this possibility: It would be great if Jari would return here in Ajax. We played together, Jari came to Ajax when I played in the first team, and we saw him become a world player, so if that kind of player are willing to come back to Amsterdam, to Ajax, and put some of their experience into Ajax Academy, it\u2019s only a great help for us. He served as a TV pundit for YLE during Euro 1992, Euro 2012, World Cup 2014 and Euro 2016, and, during the latter, also wrote comment and analysis for the newspaper Ilta-Sanomat. Jari Litmanen has confirmed in his autobiography that his professional career is over.[27] He played his last professional game in 2011. Litmanen was born into a footballing family. His father, Olavi Litmanen, was also a Finnish international and a Reipas player. His mother also played for Reipas at the women's highest level. Litmanen became a father in November 2005 when his Estonian girlfriend Ly J\u00fcrgenson gave birth to a son named Caro. The couple's second son, Bruno, was born in September 2007. Although they avoid too much publicity, they are sometimes seen together in public.[28] On 10 October 2010, Litmanen became the first Finnish team sport player to be honoured with a statue: it stands at Kisapuisto (Lahti) where he started his career in the 1970s.[29] The King \u2013 Jari Litmanen is a 2012 documentary film about Litmanen's career.[30] On 11 May 2020, Litmanen said to Unibet that his coronavirus test was positive, and he had been recovering for four weeks. He said of this time that \"I've probably never been in such bad shape\".[31] Win\n\u00a0\u00a0Draw\n\u00a0\u00a0Loss MyPa Ajax[32] Liverpool[32][33][34] HJK Finland Individual",

    "Lobia": "The black-eyed pea or black-eyed bean[2] is a legume grown around the world for its medium-sized, edible bean. It is a subspecies of the cowpea, an Old World plant domesticated in Africa, and is sometimes simply called a cowpea. The common commercial variety is called the California Blackeye; it is pale-colored with a prominent black spot. The American South has countless varieties, many of them heirloom, that vary in size from the small lady peas to very large ones. The color of the eye may be black, brown, red, pink, or green. All the peas are green when freshly shelled and brown or buff when dried. A popular variation[3][4] of the black-eyed pea is the purple hull pea or mud-in-your-eye pea; it is usually green with a prominent purple or pink spot. The currently accepted botanical name for the black-eyed pea is Vigna unguiculata subsp. unguiculata,[5] although previously it was classified in the genus Phaseolus. Vigna unguiculata subsp. dekindtiana is the wild relative and Vigna unguiculata subsp. sesquipedalis is the related asparagus bean. Other beans of somewhat similar appearance, such as the frijol ojo de cabra (goat's-eye bean) of northern Mexico, are sometimes incorrectly called black-eyed peas, and vice versa. The Black-eyed pea originates from West Africa and has been cultivated in China and India since prehistoric times.[6] It was grown[7] in Virginia since the 17th century by African slaves[8] who were brought to America along with the indigenous plants from their homelands.[9] The crop would also eventually [10] prove popular in Texas. The planting of crops of black-eyed peas was promoted by George Washington Carver because, as a legume, it adds nitrogen to the soil and has high nutritional value. Throughout the South, the black-eyed pea is still a widely used ingredient today[11] in soul food and cuisines of the Southern United States.[12] The black-eye pea is cultivated throughout the world.[1] In non-tropical climates, this heat-loving crop should be sown after all danger of frost has passed and the soil is warm. Seeds sown too early will rot before germination. Black-eyed peas are extremely drought tolerant, so excessive watering should be avoided.[13] The crop is relatively free of pests and disease. Root-knot nematodes can be a problem, especially if crops are not rotated. As a nitrogen-fixing legume, fertilization can exclude nitrogen three weeks after germination. The blossom produces nectar plentifully, and large areas can be a source of honey. Because the bloom attracts a variety of pollinators, care must be taken in the application of insecticides to avoid label violations. After planting the pea, it should start to grow after 2\u20135 days. In the Southern United States, eating black-eyed peas or Hoppin' John (a traditional soul food) on New Year's Day is thought to bring prosperity in the new year.[14] The peas are typically cooked with a pork product for flavoring (such as bacon, fatback, ham bones, or hog jowls) and diced onion, and served with a hot chili sauce or a pepper-flavored vinegar. The traditional meal also includes cabbage, collard, turnip, or mustard greens, and ham. The peas, since they swell when cooked, symbolize prosperity; the greens symbolize money; the pork, because pigs root forward when foraging, represents positive motion.[15] Cornbread, which represents gold, also often accompanies this meal.[16] Several legends exist as to the origin of this custom. Two popular explanations for the South's association with peas and good luck date back to the American Civil War. The first is associated with General William T. Sherman's march of the Union Army to the sea, during which they pillaged the Confederates' food supplies. Stories say peas and salted pork were said to have been left untouched, because of the belief that they were animal food unfit for human consumption. Southerners considered themselves lucky to be left with some supplies to help them survive the winter, and black-eyed peas evolved into a representation of good luck. One challenge to this legend is that General Sherman brought backup supplies with him including three days of animal feed[17] and would have been unlikely to have left even animal feed untouched. In addition, the dates of the first average frost for Atlanta and Savannah, respectively, are November 13 and November 28.[18] As Sherman's march was from November 15 to December 21, 1864, it is improbable, although possible, that the Union Army would have come across standing fields of black-eyed peas as relayed in most versions of the legend. In another Southern tradition, black-eyed peas were a symbol of emancipation for African-Americans who had previously been enslaved, and who after the Civil War were officially freed on New Year's Day.[19][20] Other Southern American traditions point to Jews of Ashkenazi and Sephardic ancestry in Southern cities and plantations eating the peas.[21] In Egypt, black-eyed peas are called lobia.[22] When cooked with onions, garlic, meat and tomato juice, and served with Egyptian rice with some pastina called shaerya mixed in, they make the most famous rice dish in Egypt. In Jordan, Lebanon, and Syria, lobya or green black-eyed beans are cooked with onion, garlic, tomatoes, peeled and chopped, olive oil, salt and black pepper. In Nigeria and Ghana within West Africa and the Caribbean, a traditional dish called akara or koose comprises mashed black-eyed peas with added salt, onions and/or peppers. The mixture is then fried. In Nigeria a pudding called 'moin-moin' is made from ground and mixed peas with seasoning as well as some plant proteins before it is steamed. This is served with various carbohydrate-rich foods such as pap, rice or garri.[23] In Indonesia, black-eyed peas are called kacang tunggak\u00a0[id] or kacang tolo in the local language. They are commonly used in curry dishes such as sambal goreng, a hot and spicy red curry dish, sayur brongkos, or sayur lodeh. The bean is commonly used across India. In the Hindi dialects of North India, black-eyed peas are called lobia (\u0932\u094b\u092c\u0940\u092f\u093e) / rongi (\u0930\u094b\u0902\u0917\u0940) and are cooked like daal , and served with boiled rice.[24] In Nepali- speaking areas of India and Nepal, it is called lobia (Nepali- \u0932\u094b\u092c\u0940\u092f\u093e, Bodi, \u092c\u094b\u0921\u0940). In Punjabi-speaking areas of both India and Pakistan, they are called rongi/lobia (Punjabi-\u0a30\u0a4c\u0a01\u0a17\u0a40/\u0a32\u0a4b\u0a2c\u0a40\u0a06). In Gujarat, they are called suki choli/choli (Gujarati- \u0ab8\u0ac1\u0a95\u0ac0 \u0a9a\u0acb\u0ab3\u0ac0/\u0a9a\u0acb\u0ab3\u0ac0). In Bengali speaking parts of India (West Bengal) and Bangladesh, they are known as borboti kolai  (Bengali-\u09ac\u09b0\u09ac\u099f\u09bf \u0995\u09b2\u09be\u0987). In Odisha, they are called jhudanga/jhunga (Odia- \u0b1d\u0b41\u0b21\u0b3c\u0b19\u0b4d\u0b17/\u0b1d\u0b41\u0b19\u0b4d\u0b17). In Assam, they are called lesera maah (Assamese- \u09b2\u09c7\u099a\u09f0\u09be \u09ae\u09be\u09b9). In Goa and other Konkani speaking areas of India, lobia/black eyed beans are called bogdo /chawli (Konkani- \u092c\u094b\u0917\u094d\u0921\u094b/\u091a\u0935\u0933\u0940). In Maharashtra, they are called chawli (Marathi- \u091a\u0935\u0933\u0940) and made into a curry called chawli amti or chawli usal.[25] In Karnataka, they are called alsande kalu (Kannada- \u0c85\u0cb2\u0cb8\u0c82\u0ca6\u0cc6 \u0c95\u0cbe\u0cb3\u0cc1) and used in the preparation of huli, a popular type of curry.[26] In the coastal areas of southern Karnataka like South Kanara district, they are called as lathanay bitt in Tulu language (Tulu- \u0cb2\u0ca4\u0ccd\u0ca4\u0ca3\u0cc6 \u0cac\u0cbf\u0ca4\u0ccd\u0ca4) and are cooked in spiced coconut paste to make a saucy curry or a dry coconut curry. In Tamil Nadu, they are called karamani/thattapayaru (Tamil- \u0b95\u0bbe\u0bb0\u0bae\u0ba3\u0bbf/\u0ba4\u0b9f\u0bcd\u0b9f\u0baa\u0bcd\u0baa\u0baf\u0bbf\u0bb1\u0bc1) and used in various recipes, including being boiled and made into a salad-like sundal (often during the Ganesh Chaturthi and Navratri festivals).[27] In Andhra Pradesh and Telangana, they are known by the name bobbarlu/alasandalu kura (Telugu- \u0c2c\u0c4a\u0c2c\u0c4d\u0c2c\u0c30\u0c4d\u0c32\u0c41/\u0c05\u0c32\u0c38\u0c02\u0c26\u0c32\u0c41 \u0c15\u0c42\u0c30), and are used for variety of recipes, most popularly for Vada. In Kerala, they are called vellapayar (Malayalam-\u0d35\u0d46\u0d33\u0d33\u0d2a\u0d2f\u0d7c) and is a part of the Sadhya dish, Olan. In Vietnam, black-eyed peas are used in a sweet dessert called ch\u00e8 \u0111\u1eadu tr\u1eafng (black-eyed peas and sticky rice with coconut milk). In Cyprus (\u03c6\u03c1\u03ad\u03c3\u03ba\u03bf \u03bb\u03bf\u03c5\u03b2\u03af (fresko luvi)), Greece (\u03bc\u03b1\u03c5\u03c1\u03bf\u03bc\u03ac\u03c4\u03b9\u03ba\u03b1) and Turkey (b\u00f6r\u00fclce salatas\u0131), blanched black-eyed peas are eaten as salad with a dressing of olive oil, salt, lemon juice, onions and garlic.[28] In Portugal, black-eyed peas are served with boiled cod and potatoes, with tuna, and in salads. \"Hoppin' John\", made of black-eyed peas or field peas, rice, and pork, is a traditional dish in parts of the Southern United States. Texas caviar, another traditional dish in the American South, is made from black-eyed peas marinated in vinaigrette-style dressing and chopped garlic.[29] In Brazil's northeastern state of Bahia, especially in the city of Salvador, black-eyed peas (named \"feij\u00e3o fradinho\" there) are used in a traditional street food of West African cuisine origin called acaraj\u00e9. The beans are peeled and mashed, and the resulting paste is made into balls and deep-fried in dend\u00ea. Acaraj\u00e9 is typically served split in half and stuffed with vatap\u00e1, caruru, diced green and red tomatoes, fried sun-dried shrimp and homemade hot sauce. In the northern part of Colombia, they are used to prepare a fritter called bu\u00f1uelo. The beans are immersed in water for a few hours to loosen their skins and soften them. The skins are then removed either by hand or with the help of a manual grinder. Once the skins are removed, the bean is ground or blended, and eggs are added, which produces a soft mix. The mix is fried in hot oil. It makes a nutritious breakfast meal. In Guyana, South America, and Trinidad and Tobago, it is one of the most popular type of beans cooked with rice, the main one being red kidney beans, also referred to as red beans. It is also cooked as a snack or appetizer on its own. On New Year's Eve (referred to as Old Year's Night in Guyana and Suriname), families cook a traditional dish called cook-up rice. The dish comprises rice, black-eyed peas, and other peas and a variety of meats cooked in coconut milk and seasonings. According to tradition, cook-up rice should be the first thing consumed in the New Year for good luck. Cook-up rice is also made as an everyday dish. One 100\u00a0g serving of cooked black-eyed peas contains 484 kilojoules (116 kilocalories) of food energy and is an excellent source of folate and a good source of thiamine, iron, magnesium, manganese, phosphorus, and zinc.[32] The legume is also a good source of dietary fiber (6.5\u00a0g per 100\u00a0g serving) and contains a moderate amount of numerous other vitamins and minerals (table).",
    "Luchi": " Luchi (Bengali: \u09b2\u09c1\u099a\u09bf, Odia: \u0b32\u0b41\u0b1a\u0b3f) or Lusi (Assamese: \u09b2\u09c1\u099a\u09bf) or Luchui (Hindi: \u0932\u0941\u091a\u0941\u0908 or Luchai (Hindi: \u0932\u0941\u091a\u0908))[1][2] is a deep-fried flatbread, made of Maida flour.[3][4] Luchi is especially popular in the Indian states of Uttar Pradesh, Madhya Pradesh, Bihar, Assam, Odisha, West Bengal and Tripura and in the neighbouring country Bangladesh. It is notably eaten with aloor dum or kosha mangsho.  Since Luchi does not involve rice or rice flour, it is a popular staple item at times when rice is to be avoided,[5] as in the case of ekadashi, for those who believe in the ritual, or similar instances. In such ritualistic instances, since the primary food needs to be vegetarian, Luchi is preferred with dum aloo or any similar vegetarian dish. In occasions where no such restriction is mandated, luchi and kosha mangsho is often a popular combination.[6] As per Hind\u012b \u015aabdas\u0101gara, the word Luchi or Luchui is derived from the Sanskrit word Ruchi (\u0930\u0941\u091a\u093f),[7] meaning something which is appetizing.

    "Malai Kofta": " Kofta also called  (archaic name patty) is a family of meatball or meatloaf dishes found in South Asian, Central Asian, Balkan, Middle Eastern, North African, and South Caucasian cuisines. In the simplest form, koftas consist of balls of minced meat\u2014usually beef, chicken, pork, lamb or mutton, or a mixture\u2014mixed with spices and sometimes other ingredients.[1] The earliest known recipes are found in early Arab cookbooks and call for ground lamb. There are many national and regional variations. There are also vegetable and uncooked versions. Shapes vary and include balls, patties, and cylinders. Sizes typically vary from that of a golf ball to that of an orange. In English, kofta is a loanword borrowed from the Urdu \u06a9\u0648\u0641\u062a\u06c1 and Persian \u06a9\u0648\u0641\u062a\u0647 kofta meaning pounded meat.[2][3][4][1] The earliest extant use of the word in the Urdu language is attested from the year 1665 in Mulla Nusrati's \u02bfAl\u012b\u00a0N\u0101ma.[5][6] It was first used in English in Qanoon-e-Islam in 1832,[7] and then by James Wise in 1883.[8] The languages of the region of the kofta's origin have adopted the word with minor phonetic variations.[9] Similar foods are called in other languages croquettes, dumplings, meatballs, rissoles, and turnovers.[9][10] The ancient Roman cookbook Apicius included many meatball-type recipes.[11] The first appearance of recipes for kofta are in the earliest Arab cookbooks.[12][9] The earliest recipes are for large ground lamb meatballs triple-glazed in a mixture of saffron and egg yolk.[12] This glazing method spread to the West, where it is referred to as \"gilding\" or \"endoring\".[9] Koftas moved to India; according to Alan Davidson, Nargisi Kofta was served at the Mughal court.[9] Koftas are found from the Indian subcontinent through Central Asia, the Middle East, the Balkans, and northern Africa.[9] Koftas are found in the traditional cuisines of Armenia,[13][14] Afghanistan,[13] Albania, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Bulgaria,[9] Georgia,[14] Lebanon, Egypt,[13][14] Greece,[9] India,[9][13][15] Iran, Morocco,[9] Pakistan,[16] Romania,[17] Serbia, North Macedonia, and Turkey.[13][18] Kofta is also a popular dish among Assyrian people.[19] In Turkey, it is \"a preferred offering at communal gatherings of all kinds\", according to Engin Akin.[18] In Armenia and Azerbaijan, it is, along with dolma, lavash, harissa, kebabs, and pahlava, a dish of \"clearly symbolic ethnic significance\" often argued over by gastronationalists attempting to claim it as one of their own country's traditional dishes that has been co-opted by the other country.[14] The basic Ingredient of koftas is usually meat, but they are known for their versatility. There are many different ways to prepare it, like frying, baking, steaming, boiling, or grilling.[20] In traditional preparation methods, kofta is kneaded with fine bulgur and meat, and in some middle eastern countries it is served with the raw meat in the kneaded form. With the inventive fillings that frequently enhance the flavor profile, koftas provide plenty of opportunity for creative culinary experimentation. Often added into the kofta mixture are nuts, cheese, or eggs.[21] Furthermore, koftas come in a broad range of shapes and sizes, from little oval shaped egg size balls to flatly carved rhombuses in trays, or tennis ball sized koftas. In addition to satisfying personal tastes, this variation in size and shape enables creative display and serving possibilities. Generally meat is mixed with spices and often other ingredients such as rice, bulgur, vegetables, or eggs to form a paste.[9] They can be grilled, fried, steamed, poached, baked, or marinated, and may be served with a rich spicy sauce or in a soup or stew.[9] Koftas are sometimes made from fish or vegetables or even cottage cheese  rather than red meat.[22] Some versions are stuffed with nuts, cheese, or eggs.[9] Generally the size can vary from the \"size of an orange to the size of a golf ball\",[23] although some variants are outside that range; tabriz k\u00f6ftesi, which average 20 centimetres (8\u00a0in) in diameter, are the largest.[9] They can be shaped in various forms[10] including patties, balls, or cylinders.[24] Some versions are uncooked.[12] The dictionary definition of kofta at Wiktionary",
    "Malpua": "Malpua, or sometimes shortened to pua, is a sweetened breakfast served with morning tea or as a snack with afternoon tea or as a dessert originating from the East Indian subcontinent,  popular in Bhutan, India, and Nepal.[1] Barley was the most prolific grain eaten by the Aryans of the Vedic period. One preparation was a sweet cake called malpua, where barley flour was either fried in ghee or boiled in water, and then dipped in honey. Malpua preserves both the name and the essentials of this preparation.[2] Malpua is originate in Nepal specially Far western district called Doti where it is served during festivals along with other sweets.[3] In South Indian states such as Tamil Nadu the same dish is also known as Adhirasam. The batter for malpua in some areas is prepared by crushing ripe bananas or (in Bangladesh) coconut, adding flour, and water or milk. The mixture is sometimes delicately seasoned with cardamoms. It is deep fried in oil, and served hot. In Odisha the Malpua fritters are dipped in syrup after they are fried. The Bihari version of this dish has sugar added to the batter prior to frying. Amalu (Malpua) is one of the Chapana Bhoga of Lord Jagannath and is included in the Sanja Dhupa (evening prayer). Other variations of Malpua use pineapples or mangoes instead of bananas. Bengali, Bhojpuri, Maithili and Odia malpua is traditionally made only with thickened milk and a little flour (sometimes rice flour instead of wheat flour). Malpua in northern India, particularly in Uttar Pradesh, Bihar and Rajasthan, don't contain fruit. There are several variations, using some or all of the following ingredients: maida (refined flour), semolina, milk, and yogurt. The batter is left to stand for a few hours before being spooned into a kadhai of hot oil to form a bubbling pancake which should be crisp around the edges. The pancakes are then immersed in a thick sugar syrup. Malpua is a popular sweet to make on the Hindu religious occasion of Holi. Malpua is also served along with Mutton curry during Holi in the non-vegetarian houses of Bhojpuri region.[4] Malpua in Nepal also known as Marpa is specially made in the Kathmandu Valley which uses maida, mashed up ripe bananas, fennel seeds, pepper corns, milk and sugar into a batter and prepared in a similar way as in India. Malpua is a famous dish during the Muslim holy month of Ramadan. Muslim families across India, as well as Pakistan prepare malpuas for iftar (meal to break the fast). This malpua includes maida, rawa, and khoya/ mawa (milk solids), and is deep fried to take the shape of a pancake. In some recipes, malpuas are dipped in sugar syrup called sira before serving. They are famous in Odia cuisine.",

In Punjab, the yogurt is traditionally made from water buffalo milk.[4] However, variations of lassi can be prepared in different ways. Cumin and cardamom are the most common spices added to lassi.[6] Lassi is traditionally served in a clay cup known as kulhar.[6] Namkin or Namkeen (salty) lassi is made by adding salt, black pepper, cumin, and sugar to the yogurt-water mixture.[1][7] Lassi masalewal (spicy lassi) is made by adding ingredients such as almonds, ginger, green chilies, and pistachios to namkin lassi.[1] Meethi (sweet) lassi is made by adding cardamom, rosewater, and saffron to the yogurt-water mixture.[1][3] Bhang lassi is a cannabis-infused drink that contains bhang, a liquid derivative of cannabis, which has effects similar to other eaten forms of cannabis.[8] It is legal in many parts of India and mainly sold during Holi, when pakoras containing bhang are also sometimes eaten. Uttar Pradesh is known to have licensed bhang shops, and in many places, one can buy bhang products and drink bhang lassis.[9] Fruits such as mangos and strawberries may be added to the yogurt-water mixture to yield, for example, mango lassi and strawberry lassi.[1][3] In 2013, a group of IIT Kharagpur students lobbied Google to name its next Android version Lassi.[10] Chilled",

    "Masala Chai": " Masala chai (/m\u0259\u02c8s\u0251\u02d0l\u0259 t\u0283a\u026a/; lit.\u2009'mixed-spice tea') is a popular beverage throughout South Asia, originating in India. It is made by brewing black tea (usually crush, tear, curl) in milk and water, and then by sweetening with sugar. Adding aromatic herbs and spices creates masala chai, although chai is often prepared unspiced.[2][3] The term chai originated from the Chinese word for tea, cha (see Etymology of tea) via the Hindi chai (\u091a\u093e\u092f). In English, this spiced tea is commonly referred to as chai tea,[4] or simply chai.[5] Originating in India,[1][6] the beverage has gained worldwide popularity, becoming a feature in many coffee and tea houses, with many using the term chai latte or chai tea latte for their version to indicate that it is made with steamed milk, much like that used to make a caff\u00e8 latte but mixed with a spiced tea concentrate instead of espresso. Tea was introduced to India by the British as a popular beverage. Tea plants have grown wild in the Assam region since antiquity, but historically, Indians viewed tea as a herbal medicine rather than as a recreational beverage.[7] In the 1830s, the British East India Company became concerned about the Chinese monopoly on tea, which constituted most of its trade and supported the enormous consumption of tea in Great Britain around 1 pound (0.45\u00a0kg) per person per year. British colonists had recently noticed the existence of the Assamese tea plants, and began to cultivate tea plantations locally. In 1870, over 90% of the tea consumed in Great Britain was still of Chinese origin, but by 1900, this had dropped to 10%, largely replaced by tea grown in India (50%) and Ceylon (33%).[8] However, consumption of black tea within India remained low until the promotional campaign by the Indian Tea Association in the early 20th century, which encouraged factories, mines, and textile mills to provide tea breaks for their workers. It also supported many independent chaiwalas throughout the growing railway system.[9] Tea was promoted as served Indian style, with small added amounts of milk and sugar. The Indian Tea Association initially disapproved of independent vendors' tendency to add spices and greatly increase the proportions of milk and sugar, thus reducing their usage (and thus purchase) of tea leaves per liquid volume. However, chai later firmly established itself as a popular beverage.[10] Black tea is typically used as a base in most chai recipes. The most common type of black tea is from Assam; however, a blend of different tea variations may be used.[11] Assam, Darjeeling, and Nilgiri are the three most common types of tea used in chai in India.[12] The spices used in masala chai often include cardamom, grated ginger, cinnamon, cloves, black peppercorns, and more. Mint and lemongrass may also be used in masala chai. [13] Masala chai in western India often excludes cloves and black peppercorns. A small amount of salt is often added to chai in the region of Bhopal.[14] The Kashmiri version of chai is brewed with green tea instead of black tea and has a more subtle blend of spices with a pinch of salt. This version is a bit savory and is pink in color, due to the addition of baking soda.[15] Traditionally in India, milk from water buffaloes is used to make chai.[16][17] Although whole milk is usually used in masala chai, alternative dairy milk such as soy milk or skim milk is also a preferred option across the world.[18] White sugar, brown sugar, demerara sugar, or honey may be used as a sweetener in chai. Jaggery may also be used as a sweetener.[19] Masala chai is composed of three major components: masala, chai (or tea), and milk. Recipes and preparation of chai can vary by geography and by family. One way to prepare masala chai is by gently boiling water with spices in a pot. Tea is then added to the pot and brewed to preference. Once brewing is complete, the tea and spice mixture is strained into a cup. Milk or cream can then be added.[20] A common Maharashtrian practice for preparation of one cup of chai is to first combine one-half cup of water with one-half cup of milk in a pot over heat. Sugar may be added at this point or after. Ginger is then grated into the mixture followed by adding a \"tea masala\". Although the ingredients may vary from region to region, \"tea masala\" typically consists of crushed ginger, crushed cardamom, lemongrass, cloves, and cinnamon.[21] The mixture is brought to a boil and 1 teaspoon of loose black tea[22] is added. Over the last few years, chai has gained popularity for it complex flavors as well as the numerous health benefits consuming chai provides. The blend of black tea leaves with spices such as ginger, cardamom, cinnamon, cloves, and black pepper provides a rich source of antioxidants.[23] Antioxidants help reduce inflammation and support heart health. Ginger and cinnamon, in particular have shown properties that reduce blood pressure and boost immunity.[23] The combination of spices in chai also offers a warming effect which aids overall digestion and improves circulation. Depending on how it is made, it can have less caffeine content than coffee, making it a better alternative for those with caffeine intolerance.[23] Small vendors (called chaiwalla in Hindi/cha-ola in Bengali) are found by the side of every highway, road and alley \u2013 often the only establishments that will be open through the night. They generally also sell tobacco and snacks. Many will deliver tea to people's places of business in a chaidaan, a wooden or metal frame carrier for cups.[24] In the metropolitan city of Mumbai, roadside tea stalls serve smaller cups of tea at a lower budget which is referred to as 'cutting chai', the term 'cutting' referring to the halving of quantity contained in a full cup to reduce the cost of the cup of tea.[25] In Pakistan, masala chai is usually brewed with milk and sweetened with spices like nutmeg, cinnamon and/or cloves.[26] Chai can also be served in a kulhad.[27] Masala chai is popular in East Africa and the Caribbean.[28][29] It is also quite popular in the GCC; but it is locally known as Karak Tea or Chai Karak (Arabic: \u0634\u0627\u064a \u0643\u0631\u0643, Urdu: \u06a9\u0691\u06a9 \u0686\u0627\u0626\u06d2).[30] In the West, to better simulate water buffalo milk, one may try using dry or powdered milk, along with the raw or turbinado sugar normally used in India. In addition, as milk consumption in all age groups in the West has started to decrease steadily over the last 50 years, substitutes such as oat and almond milk have emerged as an alternative to water buffalo milk.[31] As an alternative to the hot tea format, several types of cold \"chai\" beverages have become popular in the United States. These range in complexity from a simple spiced iced tea without milk to a slush of spiced tea, ice, and milk (or nondairy creamer) mixed in a blender and topped with whipped cream.[32] Chai with added espresso is  called a  \"dirty chai\" in America, as well as \"java chai\", \"red eye chai\", \"turbocharger\", \"chai charger\", \"tough guy chai\", etc.[33][34]",

Traditionally served with potato curry, chutneys, and sambar, it is a common breakfast item in South India,[5] though it can also be found in many other parts of the country[4][6] and overseas.[7][8] One common variant is the paper masala dosa, which is made with a thinner batter, resulting in a crisper, almost paper-thin final product. The dosa is made by soaking rice and lentils overnight in water and then grinding them into a batter. The batter is fermented overnight. To make the dosa the batter is spread on a hot tava using a ladle or a bowl.  It is pan-roasted until crispy and served with potato curry, chutneys or sambar. Hot",

It differs from the plain yogurt because of the technique of preparation. There are many variations of mishti doi according to their popularity. Sweet curd of Nabadwip, Kolkata, Bogra, etc are very popular.[5] Mishti doi is prepared by boiling milk until it is slightly thickened, sweetening it with sugar, either gura (brown sugar) or khejur gura (date molasses), and allowing the milk to ferment overnight.[6] Earthenware is always used as the container for making mitha dahi because the gradual evaporation of water through its porous walls not only further thickens the yoghurt,[7] but also produces the right temperature for the growth of the culture. Very often the yoghurt is delicately seasoned with a pinch of cardamom for fragrance. Baked yogurt is a similar preparation in the West. Before the discovery of miracle drugs for typhoid, well-known alopathic physicians like Dr. B. C. Roy, Col.

The name originates from the Tamil words mi\u1e37agu (\u0bae\u0bbf\u0bb3\u0b95\u0bc1 'black pepper'), and thanneer (\u0ba4\u0ba3\u0bcd\u0ba3\u0bc0\u0bb0\u0bcd, 'water') (often pronounced with a silent r); literally, \"pepper-water\".[1] It is related to the dish rasam.[citation needed] Main ingredients commonly include chicken, mutton, and lentils.[2] Mulligatawny was popular in India by the end of the 18th century,[1] and by the 19th century it began to appear in cookbooks of the day, with each cook (or cookbook) featuring its own recipe.[3] Recipes for mulligatawny varied greatly at that time and over the years (e.g., Maria Rundell's A New System of Domestic Cookery contained three versions), and later versions of the soup included British modifications that included meat,[4] although the local Madras (modern Chennai) recipe on which it was based did not.[5] Early references to it in English go back to 1784.[6] In 1827, William Kitchiner wrote that it had become fashionable in Britain: Mullaga-Tawny signifies pepper water. The progress of inexperienced peripatetic Palaticians[a] has lately been arrested by this outlandish word being pasted on the windows of our Coffee-Houses; it has, we believe, answered the \"Restaurateurs'\" purpose, and often excited John Bull, to walk in and taste\u2014the more familiar name of Curry Soup\u2014would, perhaps, not have had sufficient of the charms of novelty to seduce him from his much-loved Mock-Turtle.\nIt is a fashionable Soup and a great favourite with our East Indian friends, and we give the best receipt[b] we could procure for it.[8][9] By the mid-1800s, Arthur Robert Kenney-Herbert (1840\u20131916), under the pen name Wyvern, wrote in his popular Culinary Jottings that \"really well-made mulligatunny is ... a thing of the past.\"[5] He also noted that this simple recipe prepared by poorer natives of Madras as made by \"Mootoosamy\" was made by pounding: a dessert-spoonful of tamarind, six red chillies, six cloves of garlic, a tea-spoonful of mustard seed, a salt-spoonful of fenugreek seed, twelve black peppercorns, a tea-spoonful of salt, and six leaves of karay-pauk. When worked to a paste, he adds a pint of water, and boils the mixture for a quarter of an hour. While this is going on, he cuts up two small onions, puts them into a chatty, and fries them in dessert-spoonful of ghee till they begin to turn brown, when he strains the pepper-water into the chatty, and cooks the mixture for five minutes, after which it is ready. The pepper-water is, of course, eaten with a large quantity of boiled rice, and is a meal in itself. The English, taking their ideas from this simple composition, added other condiments, with chicken, mutton, &c., thickened the liquid with flour and butter, and by degrees succeeded in concocting a soupe grasse of a decidedly acceptable kind.[5][10] According to the Oxford Companion to Food, the simplest version of the soup included chicken or mutton, fried onion, and spices.[2] More complex versions may call for \"a score of ingredients\". Versions originating in southern India commonly called for lentils.[2] The dish is featured in the sketch Dinner for One which is \nbroadcast every New Year's Eve in Scandinavia and Germany.[11] In episode 6 from season 7 of the TV show Seinfeld, the character Elaine casually orders a mulligatawny soup from the infamous Soup Nazi's soup stand. However, after Elaine comments that the Soup Nazi looks like Al Pacino, he bans Elaine from the soup stand for one year and she does not get her soup. Alfred mentions that mulligatawny is Batman's favorite soup in Batman #701.[12] Hot, often with rice",
    "Murag": "Murak (Persian: \u0645\u0648\u0631\u0643, also Romanized as M\u016brak; also known as M\u016brag)[1] is a village in Padena-ye Vosta Rural District, Padena District, Semirom County, Isfahan Province, Iran. At the 2006 census, its population was 1,080, in 245 families.[2] This Semirom County location article is a stub. You can help Wikipedia by expanding it.",
    "Murgh Makhani": "Butter chicken, traditionally known as murgh makhani (pronounced [m\u028ar\u0263 \u02c8m\u0259k\u02b0a\u02d0ni]), is an Indian dish originating in Delhi.[1][2] It is a type of curry made from chicken with a spiced tomato and butter (makhan) sauce. Its sauce is known for its rich texture. It is similar to chicken tikka masala, which uses a tomato paste.[6] The curry was developed at the Moti Mahal restaurant in the Daryaganj neighbourhood of Old Delhi in the 1950s, after the Partition of India[7] by Kundan Lal Jaggi and Kundan Lal Gujral,[8] who were both Punjabi refugees from Peshawar, British India.[9][10][2] The curry was made \"by chance\" by mixing leftover tandoori chicken in a tomato gravy, rich in butter (makhan).[11] In 1974, a recipe was published for \"Murgh makhanii (Tandoori chicken cooked in butter and tomato sauce)\".[citation needed] In 1975, the English phrase \"butter chicken\" curry first appeared in print, as a specialty of the house at Gaylord Indian restaurant in Manhattan.[12] In Toronto and the Caribbean, it can be found as a filling in pizza, poutine, wraps, roti, or rolls,[13] while in Australia and New Zealand, it is also eaten as a pie filling.[14][15][16][17] The curry is common in India, Bangladesh, Pakistan, and many other countries where a South Asian diaspora is present.[18][19][13][20][21] Due to its popularity outside of India, it is sometimes mistakenly believed to be of Western origin (like chicken tikka masala, which it is also sometimes confused with).[22] In 2024, the family of Gujral (who run Moti Mahal) sued the family of Jaggi (who run a rival restaurant) in a dispute over credit for inventing the dish.[23] Chicken is marinated for several hours in a mixture of lemon juice, dahi (yogurt), Kashmiri red chilli, salt, garam masala, ginger paste, and garlic paste. The marinated chicken is cooked in a tandoor (traditional clay oven), but may be grilled, oven-roasted, or pan-fried. It is served in a mild curry sauce that includes butter. The sauce is a tomato, garlic, and ginger-based sauce that is simmered until smooth and much of the water has evaporated. There are many variations on the composition and spicing of the sauce, which is sieved so that it is velvety smooth. Spices may include cardamom, cumin, cloves, cinnamon, coriander, pepper, garam masala, and fenugreek (Punjabi/Hindi: kasuri methi). Cashew paste may be used as a thickener and it is finally garnished with coriander.",
    "Murgh Musallam": "Murgh musallam (whole chicken) is a Mughlai dish originating from the Indian subcontinent.[1] It consists of  whole chicken marinated in a ginger-garlic paste, stuffed with boiled eggs and seasoned with spices like saffron, cinnamon, cloves, poppy seeds, cardamom and chilli. It is cooked dry or in sauce, and decorated with almonds and silver leaves.[2] Murgh musallam literally means 'whole chicken'.[2] The dish was popular among the royal Mughal families of Awadh, now  the state of Uttar Pradesh in India. It also means well done. \nIbn Battuta described Murgh Musallam as a favourite dish of Muhammad bin Tughluq.[3] The dish was also served in the Delhi Sultanate.[4] Hot",
    "Murukku": " Mu\u1e5fukku  (Tamil: \u0bae\u0bc1\u0bb1\u0bc1\u0b95\u0bcd\u0b95\u0bc1, romanized:\u00a0mu\u1e5fukku, lit.\u2009'twisting') is a savoury, crunchy snack originating from the Indian subcontinent. The name mu\u1e5fukku \"twisting\" refers to its shape.[1] In India, murukku is especially common in the states of Andhra Pradesh, Odisha, Tamil Nadu, Karnataka, and Kerala. It is called murkulu or janthukulu in Andhra Pradesh and mudki/murki in Odisha. It is also common in countries with substantial Indian and Sri Lankan diaspora communities, including Singapore, Fiji, Malaysia, and Myanmar. Called sagalay gway (\u1005\u102c\u1000\u101c\u1031\u1038\u1001\u103d\u1031; lit.\u2009'baby sparrow coils') in Burmese, it is a common snack and is used as a topping for a regional dish called dawei mont di.[2] Other names of the dish include Kannada: \u0c9a\u0c95\u0ccd\u0c95\u0cc1\u0cb2\u0cbf, romanized:\u00a0cakkuli,  Odia: \u0b26\u0b3e\u0b28\u0b4d\u0b24\u0b15\u0b32\u0b3f, romanized:\u00a0d\u0101ntakali, Marathi: \u091a\u0915\u0932\u0940, romanized:\u00a0cakal\u012b,  Gujarati: \u0a9a\u0a95\u0ab0\u0ac0, romanized:\u00a0cakri, Telugu: \u0c1a\u0c15\u0c4d\u0c30\u0c3e\u0c32\u0c41, romanized:\u00a0cakr\u0101lu or \u0c1c\u0c02\u0c24\u0c3f\u0c15\u0c32\u0c41 jantikalu, and Konkani: chakri or chakkuli. Murukku is typically made from rice flour and Vigna mungo flour. Chakli is a similar dish, typically made with an additional ingredient, chickpea flour. It is the origin of the Tamil saying Tamil: \u0baa\u0bb2\u0bcd\u0bb2\u0bb1\u0bcd\u0bb1 \u0ba4\u0bbe\u0ba4\u0bcd\u0ba4\u0bbe\u0b95\u0bcd\u0b95\u0bc1 \u0bae\u0bc1\u0bb1\u0bc1\u0b95\u0bcd\u0b95\u0bc1 \u0bb5\u0bc7\u0ba3\u0bcd\u0b9f\u0bc1\u0bae\u0bbe\u0bae\u0bcd ('toothless grandfather wants murukku'), meaning someone wants something they cannot use; murukku is very hard and can break teeth and orthodontic devices. Murukku is typically made from rice and Vigna mungo \"black gram\" flour.[3] The flours are mixed with water, salt, chili powder, asafoetida and either sesame seeds or cumin seeds. The mix is kneaded into a dough, which is shaped into spiral or coil shapes either by hand or extruded using a mould. The spirals are then deep-fried in vegetable oil. The dish has many variations, resulting from the types and proportions of flours used. Mullu mu\u1e5fukku \"thorn mu\u1e5fukku\" has an uneven texture that gives it an extra crunch. The Kai murukku \"hand murukku\") is made by hand using a stiffer dough. Pakoda mu\u1e5fukku is another ribbon-shaped variety of the snack.[4] \u0100\u1e6d\u1e6daiy\u0101mpa\u1e6d\u1e6di kai mu\u1e5fukku, a town in Tamil Nadu, is known for its unique variety of murukkus, known as Ma\u1e47app\u0101\u1e5fai mu\u1e5fukku. This gained popularity because of Krishnan Iyer, who prepared and sold this first in Ma\u1e47app\u0101\u1e5fai.[5][6][7] In 2010, the Tamil Nadu government applied for a geographical indication tag for Manapparai Murukku.[8] Some of the murukku varieties include: ",
    "Mushroom Curry": " A mushroom or toadstool is the fleshy, spore-bearing fruiting body of a fungus, typically produced above ground, on soil, or on its food source. Toadstool generally denotes one poisonous to humans.[1] The standard for the name \"mushroom\" is the cultivated white button mushroom, Agaricus bisporus; hence, the word \"mushroom\" is most often applied to those fungi (Basidiomycota, Agaricomycetes) that have a stem (stipe), a cap (pileus), and gills (lamellae, sing. lamella) on the underside of the cap. \"Mushroom\" also describes a variety of other gilled fungi, with or without stems; therefore the term is used to describe the fleshy fruiting bodies of some Ascomycota. The gills produce microscopic spores which help the fungus spread across the ground or its occupant surface. Forms deviating from the standard morphology usually have more specific names, such as \"bolete\", \"puffball\", \"stinkhorn\", and \"morel\", and gilled mushrooms themselves are often called \"agarics\" in reference to their similarity to Agaricus or their order Agaricales. By extension, the term \"mushroom\" can also refer to either the entire fungus when in culture, the thallus (called mycelium) of species forming the fruiting bodies called mushrooms, or the species itself. The terms \"mushroom\" and \"toadstool\" go back centuries and were never precisely defined, nor was there consensus on application. During the 15th and 16th centuries, the terms mushrom, mushrum, muscheron, mousheroms, mussheron, or musserouns were used.[3] The term \"mushroom\" and its variations may have been derived from the French word mousseron in reference to moss (mousse). Delineation between edible and poisonous fungi is not clear-cut, so a \"mushroom\" may be edible, poisonous, or unpalatable.[4][5] The word toadstool appeared first in 14th century England as a reference for a \"stool\" for toads, possibly implying an inedible poisonous fungus.[6] Identifying what is and is not a mushroom requires a basic understanding of their macroscopic structure. Most are basidiomycetes and gilled. Their spores, called basidiospores, are produced on the gills and fall in a fine rain of powder from under the caps as a result. At the microscopic level, the basidiospores are shot off basidia and then fall between the gills in the dead air space. As a result, for most mushrooms, if the cap is cut off and placed gill-side-down overnight, a powdery impression reflecting the shape of the gills (or pores, or spines, etc.) is formed (when the fruit body is sporulating). The color of the powdery print, called a spore print, is useful in both classifying and identifying mushrooms. Spore print colors include white (most common), brown, black, purple-brown, pink, yellow, and creamy, but almost never blue, green, or red.[7] While modern identification of mushrooms is quickly becoming molecular, the standard methods for identification are still used by most and have developed into a fine art harking back to medieval times and the Victorian era, combined with microscopic examination. The presence of juices upon breaking, bruising-reactions, odors, tastes, shades of color, habitat, habit, and season are all considered by both amateur and professional mycologists. Tasting and smelling mushrooms carries its own hazards because of poisons and allergens. Chemical tests are also used for some genera.[8] In general, identification to genus can often be accomplished in the field using a local field guide. Identification to species, however, requires more effort. A mushroom develops from a button stage into a mature structure, and only the latter can provide certain characteristics needed for the identification of the species. However, over-mature specimens lose features and cease producing spores. Many novices have mistaken humid water marks on paper for white spore prints, or discolored paper from oozing liquids on lamella edges for colored spored prints. Typical mushrooms are the fruit bodies of members of the order Agaricales, whose type genus is Agaricus and type species is the field mushroom, Agaricus campestris. However in modern molecularly defined classifications, not all members of the order Agaricales produce mushroom fruit bodies, and many other gilled fungi, collectively called mushrooms, occur in other orders of the class Agaricomycetes. For example, chanterelles are in the Cantharellales, false chanterelles such as Gomphus are in the Gomphales, milk-cap mushrooms (Lactarius, Lactifluus) and russulas (Russula), as well as Lentinellus, are in the Russulales, while the tough, leathery genera Lentinus and Panus are among the Polyporales, but Neolentinus is in the Gloeophyllales, and the little pin-mushroom genus, Rickenella, along with similar genera, are in the Hymenochaetales. Within the main body of mushrooms, in the Agaricales, are common fungi like the common fairy-ring mushroom, shiitake, enoki, oyster mushrooms, fly agarics and other Amanitas, magic mushrooms like species of Psilocybe, paddy straw mushrooms, shaggy manes, etc. An atypical mushroom is the lobster mushroom, which is a fruitbody of a Russula or Lactarius mushroom that has been deformed by the parasitic fungus Hypomyces lactifluorum. This gives the affected mushroom an unusual shape and red color that resembles that of a boiled lobster.[9] Other mushrooms are not gilled, so the term \"mushroom\" is loosely used, and giving a full account of their classifications is difficult. Some have pores underneath (and are usually called boletes), others have spines, such as the hedgehog mushroom and other tooth fungi, and so on. \"Mushroom\" has been used for polypores, puffballs, jelly fungi, coral fungi, bracket fungi, stinkhorns, and cup fungi. Thus, the term is more one of common application to macroscopic fungal fruiting bodies than one having precise taxonomic meaning. Approximately 14,000 species of mushrooms are described.[10] A mushroom develops from a nodule, or pinhead, less than two millimeters in diameter, called a primordium, which is typically found on or near the surface of the substrate. It is formed within the mycelium, the mass of threadlike hyphae that make up the fungus. The primordium enlarges into a roundish structure of interwoven hyphae roughly resembling an egg, called a \"button\". The button has a cottony roll of mycelium, the universal veil, that surrounds the developing fruit body. As the egg expands, the universal veil ruptures and may remain as a cup, or volva, at the base of the stalk, or as warts or volval patches on the cap. Many mushrooms lack a universal veil, therefore they do not have either a volva or volval patches. Often, a second layer of tissue, the partial veil, covers the bladelike gills that bear spores. As the cap expands the veil breaks, and remnants of the partial veil may remain as a ring, or annulus, around the middle of the stalk or as fragments hanging from the margin of the cap. The ring may be skirt-like as in some species of Amanita, collar-like as in many species of Lepiota, or merely the faint remnants of a cortina (a partial veil composed of filaments resembling a spiderweb), which is typical of the genus Cortinarius. Mushrooms lacking partial veils do not form an annulus.[11] The stalk (also called the stipe, or stem) may be central and support the cap in the middle, or it may be off-center or lateral, as in species of Pleurotus and Panus. In other mushrooms, a stalk may be absent, as in the polypores that form shelf-like brackets. Puffballs lack a stalk, but may have a supporting base. Other mushrooms including truffles, jellies, earthstars, and bird's nests usually do not have stalks, and a specialized mycological vocabulary exists to describe their parts. The way the gills attach to the top of the stalk is an important feature of mushroom morphology. Mushrooms in the genera Agaricus, Amanita, Lepiota and Pluteus, among others, have free gills that do not extend to the top of the stalk. Others have decurrent gills that extend down the stalk, as in the genera Omphalotus and Pleurotus. There are a great number of variations between the extremes of free and decurrent, collectively called attached gills. Finer distinctions are often made to distinguish the types of attached gills: adnate gills, which adjoin squarely to the stalk; notched gills, which are notched where they join the top of the stalk; adnexed gills, which curve upward to meet the stalk, and so on. These distinctions between attached gills are sometimes difficult to interpret, since gill attachment may change as the mushroom matures, or with different environmental conditions.[12] A hymenium is a layer of microscopic spore-bearing cells that covers the surface of gills. In the nongilled mushrooms, the hymenium lines the inner surfaces of the tubes of boletes and polypores, or covers the teeth of spine fungi and the branches of corals. In the Ascomycota, spores develop within microscopic elongated, sac-like cells called asci, which typically contain eight spores in each ascus. The Discomycetes, which contain the cup, sponge, brain, and some club-like fungi, develop an exposed layer of asci, as on the inner surfaces of cup fungi or within the pits of morels. The Pyrenomycetes, tiny dark-colored fungi that live on a wide range of substrates including soil, dung, leaf litter, and decaying wood, as well as other fungi, produce minute, flask-shaped structures called perithecia, within which the asci develop.[13] In the basidiomycetes, usually four spores develop on the tips of thin projections called sterigmata, which extend from club-shaped cells called a basidia. The fertile portion of the Gasteromycetes, called a gleba, may become powdery as in the puffballs or slimy as in the stinkhorns. Interspersed among the asci are threadlike sterile cells called paraphyses. Similar structures called cystidia often occur within the hymenium of the Basidiomycota. Many types of cystidia exist, and assessing their presence, shape, and size is often used to verify the identification of a mushroom.[13] The most important microscopic feature for identification of mushrooms is the spores. Their color, shape, size, attachment, ornamentation, and reaction to chemical tests often can be the crux of an identification. A spore often has a protrusion at one end, called an apiculus, which is the point of attachment to the basidium, termed the apical germ pore, from which the hypha emerges when the spore germinates.[13] Many species of mushrooms seemingly appear overnight, growing or expanding rapidly. This phenomenon is the source of several common expressions in the English language including \"to mushroom\" or \"mushrooming\" (expanding rapidly in size or scope) and \"to pop up like a mushroom\" (to appear unexpectedly and quickly). In reality, all species of mushrooms take several days to form primordial mushroom fruit bodies, though they do expand rapidly by the absorption of fluids.[14][15][16][17] The cultivated mushroom, as well as the common field mushroom, initially form a minute fruiting body, referred to as the pin stage because of their small size. Slightly expanded, they are called buttons, once again because of the relative size and shape. Once such stages are formed, the mushroom can rapidly pull in water from its mycelium and expand, mainly by inflating preformed cells that took several days to form in the primordia.[18] Similarly, there are other mushrooms, like Parasola plicatilis (formerly Coprinus plicatlis), that grow rapidly overnight and may disappear by late afternoon on a hot day after rainfall.[19] The primordia form at ground level in lawns in humid spaces under the thatch and after heavy rainfall or in dewy conditions balloon to full size in a few hours, release spores, and then collapse.[20][21] Not all mushrooms expand overnight; some grow very slowly and add tissue to their fruiting bodies by growing from the edges of the colony or by inserting hyphae. For example, Pleurotus nebrodensis grows slowly, and because of this combined with human collection, it is now critically endangered.[22] Though mushroom fruiting bodies are short-lived, the underlying mycelium can itself be long-lived and massive. A colony of Armillaria solidipes (formerly known as Armillaria ostoyae) in Malheur National Forest in the United States is estimated to be 2,400 years old, possibly older, and spans an estimated 2,200 acres (8.9\u00a0km2).[23] Most of the fungus is underground and in decaying wood or dying tree roots in the form of white mycelia combined with black shoelace-like rhizomorphs that bridge colonized separated woody substrates.[24] Raw brown mushrooms are 92% water, 4% carbohydrates, 2% protein and less than 1% fat. In a 100 grams (3.5 ounces) amount, raw mushrooms provide 22 calories and are a rich source (20% or more of the Daily Value, DV) of B vitamins, such as riboflavin, niacin and pantothenic acid, selenium (37% DV) and copper (25% DV), and a moderate source (10-19% DV) of phosphorus, zinc and potassium (table). They have minimal or no vitamin C and sodium content. The vitamin D content of a mushroom depends on postharvest handling, in particular the unintended exposure to sunlight. The US Department of Agriculture provided evidence that UV-exposed mushrooms contain substantial amounts of vitamin D.[27] When exposed to ultraviolet (UV) light, even after harvesting,[28] ergosterol in mushrooms is converted to vitamin D2,[29] a process now used intentionally to supply fresh vitamin D mushrooms for the functional food grocery market.[30][31] In a comprehensive safety assessment of producing vitamin D in fresh mushrooms, researchers showed that artificial UV light technologies were equally effective for vitamin D production as in mushrooms exposed to natural sunlight, and that UV light has a long record of safe use for production of vitamin D in food.[30] Mushrooms are used extensively in cooking, in many cuisines (notably Chinese, Korean, European, and Japanese). Humans have valued them as food since antiquity.[32] Most mushrooms sold in supermarkets have been commercially grown on mushroom farms. The most common of these, Agaricus bisporus, is considered safe for most people to eat because it is grown in controlled, sterilized environments. Several varieties of A.\u00a0bisporus are grown commercially, including whites, crimini, and portobello. Other cultivated species available at many grocers include Hericium erinaceus, shiitake, maitake (hen-of-the-woods), Pleurotus, and enoki. In recent years, increasing affluence in developing countries has led to a considerable growth in interest in mushroom cultivation, which is now seen as a potentially important economic activity for small farmers.[33] China is a major edible mushroom producer.[34] The country produces about half of all cultivated mushrooms, and around 2.7 kilograms (6.0\u00a0lb) of mushrooms are consumed per person per year by 1.4\u00a0billion people.[35] In 2014, Poland was the world's largest mushroom exporter, reporting an estimated 194,000 tonnes (191,000 long tons; 214,000 short tons) annually.[36] Separating edible from poisonous species requires meticulous attention to detail; there is no single trait by which all toxic mushrooms can be identified, nor one by which all edible mushrooms can be identified. People who collect mushrooms for consumption are known as mycophagists,[37] and the act of collecting them for such is known as mushroom hunting, or simply \"mushrooming\". Even edible mushrooms may produce allergic reactions in susceptible individuals, from a mild asthmatic response to severe anaphylactic shock.[38][39] Even the cultivated A.\u00a0bisporus contains small amounts of hydrazines, the most abundant of which is agaritine (a mycotoxin and carcinogen).[40] However, the hydrazines are destroyed by moderate heat when cooking.[41] A number of species of mushrooms are poisonous; although some resemble certain edible species, consuming them could be fatal. Eating mushrooms gathered in the wild is risky and should only be undertaken by individuals knowledgeable in mushroom identification. Common best practice is for wild mushroom pickers to focus on collecting a small number of visually distinctive, edible mushroom species that cannot be easily confused with poisonous varieties. Common mushroom hunting advice is that if a mushroom cannot be positively identified, it should be considered poisonous and not eaten.[42] Many mushroom species produce secondary metabolites that can be toxic, mind-altering, antibiotic, antiviral, or bioluminescent. Although there are only a small number of deadly species, several others can cause particularly severe and unpleasant symptoms. Toxicity likely plays a role in protecting the function of the basidiocarp: the mycelium has expended considerable energy and protoplasmic material to develop a structure to efficiently distribute its spores. One defense against consumption and premature destruction is the evolution of chemicals that render the mushroom inedible, either causing the consumer to vomit the meal (see emetics), or to learn to avoid consumption altogether. In addition, due to the propensity of mushrooms to absorb heavy metals, including those that are radioactive, as late as 2008, European mushrooms may have included toxicity from the 1986 Chernobyl disaster and continued to be studied.[43][44] Mushrooms with psychoactive properties have long played a role in various native medicine traditions in cultures all around the world. They have been used as sacrament in rituals aimed at mental and physical healing, and to facilitate visionary states. One such ritual is the velada ceremony. A practitioner of traditional mushroom use is the shaman or curandera (priest-healer).[45] Psilocybin mushrooms, also referred to as psychedelic mushrooms, possess psychedelic properties. Commonly known as \"magic mushrooms\" or \"'shrooms\", they are openly available in smart shops in many parts of the world, or on the black market in those countries which have outlawed their sale. Psilocybin mushrooms have been reported to facilitate profound and life-changing insights often described as mystical experiences. Recent scientific work has supported these claims, as well as the long-lasting effects of such induced spiritual experiences.[46] Psilocybin, a naturally occurring chemical in certain psychedelic mushrooms such as Psilocybe cubensis, is being studied for its ability to help people suffering from psychological disorders, such as obsessive\u2013compulsive disorder. Minute amounts have been reported to stop cluster and migraine headaches.[48] A double-blind study, done by  Johns Hopkins Hospital, showed psychedelic mushrooms could provide people an experience with substantial personal meaning and spiritual significance. In the study, one third of the subjects reported ingestion of psychedelic mushrooms was the single most spiritually significant event of their lives. Over two-thirds reported it among their five most meaningful and spiritually significant events. On the other hand, one-third of the subjects reported extreme anxiety. However the anxiety went away after a short period of time.[49] Psilocybin mushrooms have also shown to be successful in treating addiction, specifically with alcohol and cigarettes.[50] A few species in the genus Amanita, most recognizably A. muscaria, but also A. pantherina, among others, contain the psychoactive compound muscimol. The muscimol-containing chemotaxonomic group of Amanitas contains no amatoxins or phallotoxins, and as such are not hepatoxic, though if not properly cured will be non-lethally neurotoxic due to the presence of ibotenic acid. The Amanita intoxication is similar to Z-drugs in that it includes CNS depressant and sedative-hypnotic effects, but also dissociation and delirium in high doses. Some mushrooms are used in folk medicine.[51] In a few countries, extracts, such as polysaccharide-K, schizophyllan, polysaccharide peptide, or lentinan, are government-registered adjuvant cancer therapies,[52][53][51] but clinical evidence for efficacy and safety of these extracts in humans has not been confirmed.[51][54] Although some mushroom species or their extracts may be consumed for therapeutic effects, some regulatory agencies, such as the US Food and Drug Administration, regard such use as a dietary supplement, which does not have government approval or common clinical use as a prescription drug.[51] Mushrooms can be used for dyeing wool and other natural fibers. The chromophores of mushroom dyes are organic compounds and produce strong and vivid colors, and all colors of the spectrum can be achieved with mushroom dyes. Before the invention of synthetic dyes, mushrooms were the source of many textile dyes.[55] Some fungi, types of polypores loosely called mushrooms, have been used as fire starters (known as tinder fungi). Mushrooms and other fungi play a role in the development of new biological remediation techniques (e.g., using mycorrhizae to spur plant growth) and filtration technologies (e.g. using fungi to lower bacterial levels in contaminated water).[56] There is an ongoing research in the field of genetic engineering aimed towards creation of the enhanced qualities of mushrooms for such domains as nutritional value enhancement, as well as medical use.[57]",

    "Mutton Biryani": "This is an accepted version of this page   Biryani (/b\u025c\u02d0r\u02c8j\u0251\u02d0ni/) is a mixed rice dish, mainly popular in South Asia. It is made with rice, some type of meat (chicken, goat, lamb, beef, prawn, or fish) and spices. To cater to vegetarians, in some cases, it is prepared by substituting vegetables or paneer for the meat.[1] Sometimes eggs or potatoes are also added.[2] Biryani is one of the most popular dishes in South Asia and among the South Asian diaspora, although the dish is often associated with the region's Muslim population in particular.[3] Similar dishes are also prepared in other parts of the world such as in  Iran, Iraq, Myanmar, Thailand, and Malaysia.[4] Biryani is the single most-ordered dish on Indian online food ordering and delivery services, and has been labelled as the most popular dish overall in India.[3][5] One theory states that it originated from birinj (Persian: \u0628\u0631\u0646\u062c), the Persian word for rice.[6][7] Another theory states that it is derived from biryan or beriyan (Persian: \u0628\u0631\u06cc\u0627\u0646), which means \"to fry\" or \"to roast\".[8][9] It may alternatively be related to the Persian word bereshtan (Persian: \u0628\u0631\u0634\u062a\u0646) which also means \"to roast (onions)\", as the dish is often prepared by flavouring rice with fried onions and meat, besides mild spices. The exact origin of the dish is uncertain, however, it is speculated to have originated in Persia, (now Iran) or South Asia. In North India, different varieties of biryani developed.[6][10] According to the historian Lizzie Collingham, the modern biryani developed in the royal kitchens of the Mughal Empire (1526\u20131857) and is a mix of the native spicy rice dishes of South Asia and the Persian polao.[11] Indian restaurateur Kris Dhillon believes that the dish originated in Persia and was brought to South Asia by the Mughals.[12] Salma Hossein, whom the BBC regards as the \"doyenne of Islamic cooking in India\", shares a similar view, asserting that biryani came to South Asia from Persia even before the Mughal era. Food scholar Pushpesh Pant also challenges the Mughal-origin claim, stating that it originated in Iran and that \"there is no evidence that biryani first came to this land with the Mughals. It is far more probable that it travelled with pilgrims and soldier-statesmen of noble descent to the Deccan region in South India\".[13] Another theory claims that the dish was prepared in South Asia before the first Mughal emperor Babur conquered India.[14] The 16th-century Mughal text Ain-i-Akbari makes no distinction between biryanis and pilaf (or pulao): it states that the word \"biryani\" is of older usage in India.[citation needed][15] A similar theory, that biryani came to India with Timur's invasion, appears to be incorrect because there is no record of biryani having existed in his native land during that period.[14] According to Pratibha Karan, who wrote the book Biryani, biryani is of Mughal origin, derived from pilaf varieties brought to the South Asian subcontinent by Arab and Persian traders. She speculates that the pulao was an army dish in medieval India. Armies would prepare a one-pot dish of rice with any available red meat. Over time, the dish became biryani due to different methods of cooking, with the distinction between \"pulao\" and \"biryani\" being arbitrary.[6][14] According to Vishwanath Shenoy, the owner of a biryani restaurant chain in India, one branch of biryani comes from the Mughals, while another was brought by the Arab traders to Malabar in South India.[16] There are various apocryphal stories dating the invention to Shah Jahan's time but Rana Safvi, the distinguished historian, says she could only find a recipe from the later Mughal period, from Bahadur Shah Zafar's time. It is not her claim that there was no biryani before that; just that she has not found a recipe. Other historians who have gone through texts say that the first references to biryani only appear around the 18th century.[17] Some claim that the dish \"oonchoru\" as mentioned in Sangam literature, which dates from between 200 BCE and 200 CE, is a predecessor of modern biryani. This dish, which was served to the soldiers of the Chera kings in Kerala, was said to be made of rice, ghee, meat, turmeric, coriander, pepper, and bay leaf.[18][19][20] The spices used in the preparation of South Indian biryanis, such as those used in the Malabar variety, are distinctive to the region and the Western Ghats. These spices are not found in the Middle East, Persia, or North India, underscoring the unique culinary heritage and local ingredients of South Indian biryani.[18][19][20] In South India, where rice is more widely used as a staple food, several distinct varieties of biryani emerged from Hyderabad in Telangana, Vijayawada in Andhra Pradesh, Mangalore and Bhatkal in Coastal Karnataka, Thalassery and Kozhikode in Malabar Kerala, as well as Ambur and Chettinad in Tamil Nadu.[6][10] Pilaf or pulao, as it is known on the Indian subcontinent, is another mixed rice dish popular in the cuisines of the Indian subcontinent, Central Asia, and Middle Eastern cuisine. Opinions differ on the differences between pulao and biryani, and whether actually there is a difference between the two.[21] According to Delhi-based historian Sohail Hashmi, pulao tends to be plainer than biryani, and consists of meat or vegetables cooked with rice with the bottom layered with potatoes or onions. Biryani contains more gravy (or yakhni), and is often cooked longer, leaving the meat (and vegetables, if present) more tender, and the rice more flavoured. Biryani is also cooked with additional dressings and often would have a light layer of scorched rice at the bottom.[22] Author Pratibha Karan states that while the terms are often applied arbitrarily, the main distinction is that a biryani consists of two layers of rice with a layer of meat (and vegetables, if present) in the middle, while the pulao is not layered.[14] Author Colleen Taylor Sen lists the following distinctions between biryani and pulao:[23] Ingredients for biryani vary according to the region and the type of meat and vegetables used. Meat (chicken, goat, beef, lamb,[26] prawn or fish) is the prime ingredient with rice. As is common in dishes of South Asia, vegetables are sometimes also used when preparing biryani. Corn may be used, depending on the season and availability. Navratan biryani tends to use sweeter, richer ingredients such as cashews, sultanas (kishmish), and fruits such as apples and pineapples.[22] The spices and condiments used in biryani may include fennel seeds, ghee (clarified butter), nutmeg, mace,[27] pepper, cloves,[27] cardamom, cinnamon, bay leaves, coriander, mint, ginger, onions, tomatoes, green chilies,[26] star anise, and garlic. The premium varieties include saffron.[27] Some commercial recipes for Biryani also include aromatic essences such as Mitha Ittar see attar, kewra and rose water. Dried sour prunes (Alu Bukhara) may also be added to the biryani. In nasi briyani and other variants made in Southeast Asian countries such as Malaysia, Singapore, and Indonesia, typical Southeast Asian spices and aromatics such as pandan leaf may be used alongside typical South Asian spices.[28] The main ingredient that usually accompanies the spices is chicken, lamb or goat meat; special varieties might use beef or seafood instead. The dish may be served with dahi chutney or raita, seekh kebab, Qorma, curry, a sour dish of aubergine (brinjal), boiled egg, and salad. Biryani can be cooked using one of two styles/techniques, pakki (\"cooked\") and kacchi (\"raw\").[29] There are many types of biryani, whose names are often based on their region of origin. For example, Sindhi biryani developed in the Sindh region of what is now Pakistan, and Hyderabadi biryani developed in the city of Hyderabad in South India. Some have taken the name of the shop that sells it, for example: Haji Biriyani, Haji Nanna Biriyani in Old Dhaka,[30] Fakhruddin Biriyani in Dhaka,[31][32] Students biryani in Karachi, Lucky biryani in Bandra, Mumbai and Baghdadi biryani in Colaba, Mumbai.[22] Biryanis are often specific to the Muslim communities where they originate; they are usually the defining dishes of those communities.[33] Ambur/Vaniyambadi biryani is a variety cooked in the neighboring towns of Ambur and Vaniyambadi in the Tirupattur district of the northeastern part of Tamil Nadu, which has a high Muslim population. It was introduced during the Nawabs of Arcot who once ruled the area. It is typically made with jeera samba rice.[34] Nowadays, it is popular as Ambur or Vaniyambadi style biryani as those are two prominent towns along the popular Bangalore to Chennai highway where travellers stop for eating.[35] The Ambur/Vaniyambadi biryani is accompanied by dhalcha, a sour brinjal curry, and pachadi or raitha (sliced onions mixed with plain yogurt, tomato, chilies, and salt). It has a distinctive aroma and is considered light on the stomach.[citation needed] The usage of spice is moderate, and curd is used as a gravy base. It also has a higher ratio of meat to rice.[15] Ambur-style biriyani is popular as street food all across South India. This is an integral part of the Navayath cuisine and a specialty of Bhatkal, a coastal town in Karnataka. Its origins are traced to the Persian traders who introduced biryani along with kababs and Indian breads. In Bhatkali biryani, the meat is cooked in an onion and green chili-based masala and layered with fragrant rice. It has a unique spicy and heady flavour, and the rice is overwhelmingly white with mild streaks of orange. Its variations include beef, goat, chicken, titar (Partridge), egg, fish, crab, prawn, and vegetable biryani. Though similar to those in Thalassery, this biryani differs with lingering after-notes of mashed onions laced with garlic[citation needed]. A few chilies and spices littered with curry leaves lends a unique flavour to Bhatkal biryani. No oil is used.[36] Bohri biryani, prepared by the Bohris is flavoured with lots of tomatoes.[16] It is popular in Karachi. Chettinad biryani is famous in the Indian state of Tamil Nadu. It is made of jeeraka samba rice, and smells of spices and ghee. It is best taken with nenju elumbu kuzhambu, a spicy and tangy goat meat gravy [citation needed]. The podi kozhi is usually topped with fried onions and curry leaves.[37][38][39][40] Degh ki biryani is a typical biryani made from small cubes of beef or mutton. This biryani originated in Ahmadnagar Sultanate and is famous in Parbhani in Marathwada region and generally served at weddings. The meat is flavoured with ginger, garlic, red chili, cumin, garam masala, fried onion and curd. This biryani is also known as kachay gosht ki biryani or dum biryani, where the meat is marinated and cooked along with short-grained and fine rice. It is left on a slow fire or dum for a fragrant and aromatic flavour. The Delhi version of biryani developed a unique local flavour as the Mughal kings shifted their political capital to the North Indian city of Delhi. Until the 1950s, most people cooked biryani in their home and rarely ate at eateries outside of their homes. Hence, restaurants primarily catered to travellers and merchants. Any region that saw more of these two classes of people nurtured more restaurants, and thus their own versions of biryani. This is the reason why most shops that sold biryani in Delhi, tended to be near mosques such as Jama Masjid (for travellers) or traditional shopping districts (such as Chandni Chowk).[citation needed] Each part of Delhi has its own style of biryani, often based on its original purpose, thus giving rise to Nizamuddin biryani, Shahjahanabad biryani, etc.[citation needed]  Nizamuddin biryani usually had little expensive meat and spices as it was primarily meant to be made in bulk for offering at the Nizamuddin Dargah shrine and thereafter to be distributed to devotees.[22] A non-dum biryani, using many green chillies, popularized by the Babu Shahi Bawarchi shops located outside the National Sports Club in Delhi is informally called Babu Shahi biryani. Another version of Delhi biryani uses achaar (pickles) and is called achaari biryani.[41] The city of Dhaka in Bangladesh used to be the capital of Bengal Subah and is known for Dhakaiya Kacchi Biryani, a Chevon Biryani made with highly seasoned rice and goat meat. The recipe includes: highly seasoned rice, goat meat, mustard oil, garlic, onion, black pepper, saffron, clove, cardamom, cinnamon, salt, lemon, doi, peanuts, cream, raisins and a small amount of cheese (either from cows or buffalo). It is accompanied by borhani, a salted mint drink made of yogurt, coriander, mint and salt. Haji biryani is a favourite among Bangladeshis living abroad.[42] A recipe was handed down by the founder of one Dhaka restaurant to the next generation. Haji Mohammad Shahed claimed, \"I have never changed anything, not even the amount of salt\".[43] Bengali style biryani often includes potatoes. The city of Dindigul in Tamil Nadu is noted for its biryani, which uses a little curd and lemon juice for a tangy taste.[44] Military hotels of Bangalore in Karnataka are known for selling Biryani served in dried leaf bowl called Donne.[45] It is typically made from jeera samba rice, yogurt with lot of common mint and coriander leaves.[46][47] Hyderabadi biryani is India's most famous biryani; some say biryani is synonymous with Hyderabad.[48] Hyderabadi biryani developed in Hyderabad Subah under the rule of Asaf Jah I, who was first appointed as the governor of Deccan by the Mughal Emperor Aurangzeb. It is made with basmati rice, spices and goat meat. Popular variations use chicken instead of goat meat. There are various forms of Hyderabadi biryani, such as kachay gosht ki biryani or dum biryani, where goat meat is marinated and cooked along with the rice. It is left on a slow fire or dum for a fragrant and aromatic flavour.[49] Memoni biryani is an extremely spicy variety developed by the Memons of Gujarat-Sindh region in India and Pakistan.[16] It is made with mutton, dahi, fried onions, and potatoes, and fewer tomatoes compared to Sindhi biryani. Kalyani biryani is a beef biryani from the former state of Hyderabad Deccan.[50] Also known as the \"poor man's\"  Hyderabadi biryani, Kalyani biryani is made from small cubes of buffalo meat or cow meat.[51][52] The meat is flavoured with ginger, garlic, turmeric, red chili, cumin, coriander powder, and lots of onion and tomato. It is first cooked as a thick curry and then cooked along with rice. Then given dum (the Indian method of steaming in a covered pot). It has a distinct tomato, jeera and dhania flavour.[53] Kalyani biryani is supposed to have originated in Bidar during the reign of the Kalyani Nawabs, who migrated to Hyderabad in mid 18th century after one of the Nawabs, Ghazanfur Jang married into the Asaf Jahi family uniting their realms.[citation needed] Kalyani biryani was served by the Kalyani Nawabs to all of their subjects who came from Bidar to Hyderabad and stayed or visited their devdi or noble mansion. Calcutta or Kolkata biryani evolved from Dhakaiya biryani and the Lucknow style biryani when Awadh's last Nawab, Wajid Ali Shah, was exiled in 1856 to the Kolkata suburb of Metiabruz. Shah brought his personal chef with him. Like Dhakaiya biryani, the Kolkata biriyani is characterized by the presence of potato in it.[16] Lucknow was a capital of Awadh Subah. For Lucknow/ avadhi biryani, basmati rice is cooked in ghee with warm, aromatic spices and then layered with a type of meat curry or marinade, sealed, and cooked over low heat until done.[54][55] A specialty of the Beary Muslim community in coastal Karnataka and is also known as Manglorean-style biryani. The dish is made using lots of green chilly and coconut and has the subtle flavor and aroma of fennel. Spices that include nutmeg, mint leaves, fennel seeds, mace (javitri), poppy seeds, almonds, star anise and others. The rice and meat (mutton, chicken, beef) are cooked separately and then layered and slowly cooked together again. This dish is highly served during marriages and other homely occasions. This type of biryani is popular in the Palakkad and Coimbatore regions. This was most commonly prepared by Rowther families in Kerala and Tamil Nadu. This type of biryani is cooked in a different style. Goat meat is most commonly used and it is entirely different from Malabar biryani.[citation needed] The exotic and aromatic Sindhi biryani, originating in the former Mughal subah based in Thatta is known in Pakistan for its spicy taste, fragrant rice, and delicate meat. Sindhi biryani is a beloved staple in food menus of Pakistani and Sindhi cuisine. Sindhi biryani is prepared with meat and a mixture of basmati rice, vegetables, and various spices. Biryani was introduced in the 1900s to Sri Lanka by the Indian Muslims who engaged in trade within the country.[citation needed]  In many cases, Sri Lankan biryani is spicier than most Indian varieties. Side dishes may include Malay pickle, Cashew curry and Mint sambol.[citation needed] Thalassery biryani is the variation of biryani found in the Indian state of Kerala. It is one of the many dishes of the Kerala Muslim community, and very popular.[56] The ingredients are chicken, spices and the specialty is the choice of rice called khyma. Khyma rice is generally mixed with ghee. Although a large number of spices such as mace, cashew nuts, sultana raisins, fennel-cumin seeds, tomato, onion, ginger, garlic, shallot, cloves and cinnamon are used,[57] there is only a small amount of chili (or chili powder) used in its preparation. A pakki biryani, the Thalassery biryani uses a small-grained thin (not round) fragrant variety of rice known as khyma or jeerakasala. The dum method of preparation (sealing the lid with dough [maida] or cloth and placing red-hot charcoal above the lid) is applied here to avoid scorched rice. In Kerala, another variety called beef biryani is well known.[58] In Myanmar (Burma), biryani is known in Burmese as danpauk or danbauk (\u1012\u1036\u1015\u1031\u102b\u1000\u103a), derived from the Persian term dum pukht, which refers to a slow oven cooking technique. Danbauk is a mainstay at festive events such as Thingyan, weddings and donation feasts.[59][60] Given danbauk's South Asian origins, danbauk restaurants and chains have traditionally been owned by Muslims, but in recent decades Buddhist entrepreneurs have entered the market.[59] Featured ingredients include: cashew nuts, yogurt, raisins and peas, chicken, cloves, cinnamon, saffron and bay leaf cooked in long-grain rice.[61] In danbauk, chicken specially seasoned with a danbauk masala spice mix,[62] is cooked with the rice.[63] Danbauk is typically eaten with a number of side dishes, including a fresh salad of sliced onions, julienned cabbage, sliced cucumbers, fermented limes and lemons, fried dried chilies, and soup.[64] In recent decades, danbauk restaurants have innovated variations, including \"ambrosia\" biryani (\u1014\u1010\u103a\u101e\u102f\u1013\u102c\u1011\u1019\u1004\u103a\u1038), which features dried fruits and buttered rice.[64] In Iraq and in the states of the Persian Gulf, biryani (\u0628\u0631\u064a\u0627\u0646\u064a: \"biryani\") is usually saffron-based with chicken usually being the meat or poultry of choice. It is popular throughout Iraq, especially in the Kurdistan Region.  Most variations also include vermicelli, fried onions, fried potato cubes, almonds, and raisins spread liberally over the rice.[16] Sometimes, a sour/spicy tomato sauce is served on the side (maraq). In Iran, during the Safavid dynasty (1501\u20131736), a dish called Beriyan Polo (Nastaliq script: \u0628\u0631\u06cc\u0627\u0646 \u067e\u0644\u0648) was made with lamb or chicken, marinated overnight\u2014with yogurt, herbs, spices, dried fruits like raisins, prunes or pomegranate seeds\u2014and later cooked in a tannour oven, then served with steamed rice.[citation needed] A different dish called biryan is popular in Afghanistan. Biryan traces its origins to the same source as biryani, when most of Afghanistan was part of Kabul and Qandahar Subahs and as today sold in Afghanistan as well as in Bhopal, India. Biryan is prepared by cooking gosht and rice together, but without the additional gravy (yakhni) and other condiments that are used in biryani. The Delhi-based historian Sohail Hashmi refers to the biryan as midway between pulao and biryani.  Afghan biryani tends to use much dry fruit such as raisins and lesser amounts of meat, often cut into tiny pieces.[22] Nasi kebuli is an Indonesian spicy steamed rice dish[65] cooked in goat meat broth, milk and ghee.[66] Nasi kebuli is descended from kabuli palaw which is an Afghani rice dish, similar to biryani served in the Indian subcontinent.[67] Although Indonesia has authentic nasi kebuli, Indonesia also inherited and has local-style of biryani which is known as nasi biryani or nasi briyani. Nasi biryani is popular among and often associated as Acehnese, Arab Indonesian, Indian Indonesian and Malay cuisine.[68] The Malaysian and Singaporean variety of biryani is called nasi briyani or nasi biryani. Although authentic styles of biryani from South India are popular, nasi briyani remains the most popular. The key differences between nasi briyani and Indian biryanis are that the meat in nasi briyani is cooked separately from the rice, and there is more curry, sauce, or gravy present in the nasi briyani than in Indian biryanis.[69] Nasi briyani dishes are very popular in Malaysia and Singapore. As an important part of Malaysian and Singaporean Indian cuisines, they are popularized through mamak stalls, hawker centres, and food courts as well as fine dining restaurants. There are also eateries that sell pork as the main meat of the dish in Singapore.[70][71] Biryani dishes are very popular in Mauritius, especially at Muslim weddings and festivities. It is also widely available at street food places. Mauritian biryanis are often accompanied by an achaar (mango pickles), chilies and salads. Kapampangan cuisine of the Philippines (often in Pampanga) features a special dish called nasing biringyi (chicken saffron rice), that is typically prepared only during special occasions such as weddings, family get-togethers or fiestas. It is not a staple of the Filipino diet as it is difficult to prepare compared to other usual dishes. Nasing biringyi is similar to the nasi briyani dish of Malaysia in style and taste. A version that has merged with the Filipino version of the Spanish paella is known as bringhe.[72] In the Cape Malay culture, a variation of biryani incorporates lentils as a key ingredient in the dish along with meat (usually beef, chicken, seafood or vegetables). The dish is made by cooking the rice and legumes and meat and gravy separately, then mixing it. Uncommonly, it is made using the dum-cooking method. The spices are similar to those used in the original Indian biryani. Variants of biryani exist in the cuisines of Somalia, Kenya, and Tanzania due to centuries of trade between the East African coast and South Asia for centuries, and the more recent migration of Indians to the latter two countries more recently during the British colonial era. Zanzibar has its own form of biryani characterized by the mixture of East African and Indian spices, as well as influences from Arab cuisine. The meat used is most commonly chicken.[73] This variant is similar to the forms of biryani served in Kenya. In Somalia, the descendant of biryani is bariis iskukaris. It is served with chicken, goat, beef, lamb, or camel meat, and spiced with the Somali spice mixture xawaash and other spices. A unique characteristic of bariis and other Somali dishes is the addition of banana on the side to be mixed with the dish. Biryani in Thailand is commonly known as khao mhok (Thai: \u0e02\u0e49\u0e32\u0e27\u0e2b\u0e21\u0e01). It is commonly paired with chicken, beef or even fish and topped with fried garlic. The dish is common in Thai cuisine and is often served with a green sour sauce. Tehari and tehri are various names for the vegetarian adaptation of Biryani but are mainly classified as pulao. It was developed for the Hindu bookkeepers of the Muslim Nawabs. It is prepared by adding potatoes to the rice, as opposed to the case of biryani, where the rice is added to the meat. In Kashmir, tehari is sold as street food. Tehari became more popular during World War II, when meat prices increased substantially and potatoes became the popular substitute in biryani. Hot",
    "Mutton Korma": "Korma or qorma (Urdu: \u0642\u0648\u0631\u0645\u06c1; Hindi: \u0915\u093c\u094b\u0930\u092e\u093e; Bengali: \u0995\u09cb\u09b0\u09ae\u09be; Persian: \u0642\u0631\u0645\u0627) is a dish with its origin in the Indian subcontinent,[1] consisting of meat or vegetables braised with yogurt, water or stock, and spices to produce a thick sauce or gravy.[2] The English name is an anglicisation of the Hindi-Urdu qorm\u0101 (\u0915\u093c\u094b\u0930\u092e\u093e, \u0642\u0648\u0631\u0645\u06c1), meaning \"braise\".[3][4] It refers to the cooking technique used in the dish.[2][5] All these words, and the names of dishes such as the Iranian ghormeh (Persian: \u0642\u0648\u0631\u0645\u0647), Turkish Kavurma and the Azerbaijani qovurma or kavarma, are ultimately derived from a Turkic word qawirma, meaning \"[a] fried thing\".[4] The Indian korma is, however, possibly unrelated in a culinary sense to the modern Turkish kavurma or to some other dishes using the same root word, as they use widely varying techniques and ingredients.[6] Korma has its roots in the Mughlai cuisine[1] of the Indian subcontinent. A characteristic Mughal dish, it can be traced back to the 16th century and to the Mughal expansion into South Asia. Kormas were often prepared in the Mughal court kitchens, such as the famous white korma, perhaps garnished with vark, was said to have been served to Shah Jahan and his guests at the inauguration of the Taj Mahal.[7] Classically, a korma is defined as a dish where meat or vegetables are braised with yogurt or stock. The technique covers many different styles of korma. The flavour of a korma is based on the mixture of spices, including ground coriander and cumin, combined with yogurt kept below curdling temperature and incorporated slowly and carefully with the meat juices. Traditionally, this would have been carried out in a pot set over a very low fire, with charcoal on the lid to provide all-round heat. A korma can be mildly spiced or fiery and may use lamb, goat meat, chicken, beef or game; some kormas combine meat and vegetables, such as spinach and turnip. The term shahi (English: royal), used for some kormas, indicates its status as a prestige dish, rather than an everyday meal, and its association with the court. The korma style is similar to other braising techniques in that the meat or vegetable is first cooked briskly, or seared, using high heat, traditionally with ghee, and then subjected to long, slow cooking using moist heat and a minimum of added liquid.[2] The pot may be sealed with dough during the last stages of cooking, using a technique called dum or dampokhtak.[2] The korma is made using a technique called bagar. in the later stage of cooking, additional spices are mixed with heated ghee and then combined with the sauce formed by the braising. The pan is then covered and shaken to release steam and mix the contents.[8] There is a wide variation between individual korma and other \"curry\" recipes. Chilli and ginger are often used, but the precise method of preparation results in widely different flavors. Indian bay leaves or dried coconut may be added, the latter being a predominantly South Indian flavoring. A korma pilau (pilaf) is a rice and meat dish made with braised meat.[9] In the United Kingdom, a typical korma as served in curry houses is a mildly spiced dish with a thick sauce. It often features almonds, cashews or other nuts, and coconut or coconut milk. In the 21st century, chicken korma has several times been cited as the most popular curry in the UK, replacing chicken tikka masala in surveys of public eating habits.[10][11] Navratan korma is a vegetarian korma made with vegetables and either paneer (an Indian cheese) or nuts \u2013 or sometimes both.[12] Navratan means \"nine gems\", and it is common for the recipe to include nine different vegetables. In some parts of South Asia, korma is used to denote a traditional Eid al-Adha (festival of the sacrifice) dish of lamb, goat, or cow that is braised in minimal or no spices. The flavour comes from the meat and fat of the chosen cuts. It was often done to preserve meats for a short-term period, as the fat layer forms a barrier to help prevent spoilage, similar to potted beef. In Malaysia, korma or 'gulai kurma' is traditionally cooked with coconut milk instead of yoghurt among the Malays, as dairy products do not feature heavily in Malay cuisine. Meats used for kurma include chicken, mutton, beef, and deer. It also often contains more vegetables, such as carrots, potatoes, and tomatoes, though this is not a hard-and-fast rule. Some recipes include tamarind as the souring agent, in place of the natural acidity of yoghurt.[13]",
    "Mysore Pak": " Mysore pak is an Indian sweet prepared in ghee. It originated in the city of Mysore,[1][2] one of the major cities in the Indian state of Karnataka. It is made of generous amounts of ghee, sugar, gram flour, and often cardamom.[1] The texture of this sweet is similar to a buttery and dense cookie.[3]\nIt is also popular in the neighboring countries Pakistan and Bangladesh (it's known as Monsur there). It is prepared and given at weddings and other festivals, including baby showers, in southern India. The Maharaja of Mysore, Krishna Raja Wadiyar IV, was a food lover and maintained a large kitchen at the Amba Vilas Palace in Mysore. Kakasura Madappa, the head chef known for preparing sweets, began experimenting, wanting to present the King with something unusual. Adding gram flour, ghee and sugar, he made a soft paaka (or mixture). Madappa was called in and asked for its name. He said the first thing that came to his mind - 'Mysore Pak'. The Maharaja loved the sweet so much that he asked Madappa to open a sweet shop outside the premises of the palace.[4] Paaka or extreme sweet refers to the sticky sugar syrup obtained by simmering sugar with an equal amount of water; specifically for Mysore pak, the simple syrup heated to the softball stage. The syrup is used as the primary sweetening agent in various Indian sweet dishes like Jalebi, Gulab Jamun, Badam puri, Mysore pak and others. The syrup is given taste with spice essences like cardamom, rose, honey etc. Paaka syrup preparation is a skilled art mastered by only a few cooks, some of whom keep their methods secret. The recipe improved through the years. However, the original sweet made with the original recipe is still available at the famous \"Guru Sweets\" stores in Devaraja Market, run by Kumar and Shivanand, great-grandsons of Madappa.[4] Mysore Pak is made from gram flour, ghee, sugar and water. It is commonly eaten in Southern India. Other ingredients that may or may not be used are Baking soda and Cardamom. This dessert-related article is a stub. You can help Wikipedia by expanding it.",
    "Naan": " Naan (/n\u0251\u02d0n/) is a leavened, oven-baked or tawa-fried flatbread, that can also be baked in a tandoor. It is characterized by a light and fluffy texture and golden-brown spots from the baking process.[1] Naan is found in the cuisines  of Central Asia, South Asia, Southeast Asia, and the Caribbean.[2][3][4] Composed of white or wheat flour and combined with a leavening agent, typically yeast, naan dough develops air pockets that contribute to its fluffy and soft texture. Additional ingredients for crafting naan include warm water, salt, ghee and yogurt, with optional additions like milk, egg, or honey. Baking powder or baking soda can be used instead of yeast to reduce the preparation time for the bread. In the baking process using a tandoor, naan dough is rolled into balls, flattened and pressed against the inner walls, which can reach temperatures up to 480 \u00b0C (900 \u00b0F). This method allows the bread to be baked within minutes, achieving a spotty browning due to intense heat. Naan can be prepared on a stovetop using a tava. The pan may be flipped upside down over the flame to achieve browning on the bread's surface. Once baked, naan is coated with ghee or butter and served warm. This soft and pliable bread accompanies meals, replacing utensils for scooping up sauces, stews, and curries, or with dryer dishes like tandoori chicken. [5] The term \"naan\" comes from Persian n\u00e2n (Persian: \u0646\u0627\u0646), a generic word for any kind of bread. The earliest known English use of the term occurs in an 1803 travelogue written by William Tooke.[6] While Tooke and other early sources spelled it \"nan\", the spelling \"naan\" has become predominant since the 1970s.[7][8] Naan spread to the Indian subcontinent during the Islamic Delhi Sultanate period. The earliest mention of naan in the region comes from the memoirs of Indo-Persian Sufi poet Amir Khusrau living in India during the 1300s AD. Khusrau mentions two kinds of naan eaten by Muslim nobles; Naan-e-Tunuk and Naan-e-Tanuri. Naan-e-Tunuk was a light or thin bread, while Naan-e-Tanuri was a heavy bread and was baked in the tandoor.[9] During India\u2019s Mughal era in the 1520s, naan was a delicacy that only nobles and royal families enjoyed because of the lengthy process of making leavened bread and because the art of making naan was a revered skill known by few. The Ain-i-Akbari, a record of the third Mughal emperor\u2019s reign, refers to naan being eaten with kebabs or kheema in it. By the 1700s, naan had reached the masses in Mughal cultural centers in South Asia.[10] In Indonesia, naan is popular among the Indian Indonesian, Arab Indonesians, Malay, Acehnese and Minangkabau, similar though not the same as roti or roti canai which was introduced from Tamils. This dish is known as roti naan or roti nan, and is cooked using Indonesian spices such as garlic.[11] Naan bya (Burmese: \u1014\u1036\u1015\u103c\u102c\u1038) in Myanmar is traditionally served at teahouses with tea or coffee as a breakfast item.[12] It is round, soft, and blistered, often buttered, or with creamy p\u00e8 byouk (boiled chickpeas) cooked with onions spread on top, or dipped with Burmese curry.[12] The Jingzhou style of guokui, a flatbread prepared inside a cylindrical charcoal oven much like a tandoor, has been described as \"Chinese naan\".[13] It is also an integral part of Uyghur cuisine and is known in Chinese as \u9995 (n\u00e1ng).[14][15] After being promoted by Kandagawa Sekizai Shoukou in 1968, which is now the sole domestic manufacturer of tandoors, naan is now widely available in Indian-style curry restaurants in Japan, where naan is typically free-flow. Some restaurants bake ingredients such as cheese, garlic, onions, and potatoes into the naan, or cover it with toppings like a pizza.[16][17][18] Shotis puri is a popular flat bread eaten in Georgia and cooked by sticking dough to the sides of a tandoor-like clay oven called a tone. In 1799, the word naan was introduced into the English language by historian and clergyman William Tooke. Today, naan can be found worldwide in restaurants serving South Asian and Middle Eastern cuisine, and it is available in many supermarkets. Fusion cuisine has introduced new dishes that incorporate naan, including naan pizza and naan tacos and even huevos rancheros (an egg dish) served over naan. Naan pizza is a type of pizza where naan is used as the crust instead of the traditional pizza dough. Chefs such as Nigella Lawson,[19] and supermarkets such as Wegmans[20] offer recipes for people to make their own naan pizza at home, though it is certainly not traditional.",
    "Neyyappam": "Neyyappam (\u0d28\u0d46\u0d2f\u0d4d\u0d2f\u0d2a\u0d4d\u0d2a\u0d02) or Yeriyappa Zuhoor is a sweet rice-based fritter fried in ghee. Neyyappam has its origins in the southern Indian state of Kerala and coastal Karnataka. The name is derived from the words neyy (\u0d28\u0d46\u0d2f\u0d4d\u0d2f\u0d4d) meaning \"ghee\" (clarified butter) and appam (\u0d05\u0d2a\u0d4d\u0d2a\u0d02) meaning \"pancake\". Neyyappam is typically made of rice flour (alternatively, with semolina), jaggery, ghee-fried coconut (pieces or grated), ghee, cardamom and milk. \nIt is served as a tea time snack usually in the evenings. Neyyappam is also served as offering in Hindu temples in Kerala.[1] It is mainly main during Navaratri and Kartika Deepotsava. This practice has also been adopted by some sections of Christians in Kerala.[2][3] Unni appam is a variant in which mashed ripe plantains or bananas are added to the batter and fried to result in a ball-like shape. Neyyappam became a topic of discussion as its name was shown on the home page of the Android N naming campaign.[4][5] The official video of Google about naming Android N[6] also shows a glimpse of neyyappam and Kerala tourism made a tweet about this naming campaign. In traditional Kerala cuisine, Neyyappam is cooked in a bronze pan called appakara (ml:\u0d05\u0d2a\u0d4d\u0d2a\u0d15\u0d4d\u0d15\u0d3e\u0d30) [1] (also known as Paniyaram Pan in Tamil Nadu), about 8 inches in diameter, having three or more large cavities and thereby giving the dish a tortoise-like shape. It can also be cooked on a griddle or in a skillet. Recipes vary from place to place, especially the ingredients chosen to prepare the batter.",
    "Pachadi": " A chutney (pronounced [\u02c8\u02a7\u0259\u0288\u0273i\u02d0]) is a spread typically associated with cuisines of the Indian subcontinent. Chutneys are made in a wide variety of forms, such as a tomato relish, a ground peanut garnish, yogurt, or curd, cucumber, spicy coconut, spicy onion, or mint dipping sauce. The word chutney derives from Hindi \u091a\u091f\u0928\u0940 cha\u1e6dn\u012b, deriving from \u091a\u093e\u091f\u0928\u093e ch\u0101\u1e6dn\u0101 'to lick' or 'to eat with appetite'.[1][2] In India, chutney refers to fresh and pickled preparations indiscriminately; however, several Indian languages use the word for fresh preparations only. In India, chutneys can be either made alongside pickles that are matured in the sun for up to two weeks and kept up to a year or, more commonly, are freshly made from fresh ingredients that can be kept a couple of days or a week in the refrigerator. In South India, Chutneys are also known as Pachadi (Telugu: \u0c2a\u0c1a\u0c4d\u0c1a\u0c21\u0c3f, Kannada: \u0caa\u0c9a\u0ca1\u0cbf, Tamil: \u0baa\u0b9a\u0bcd\u0b9a\u0b9f\u0bbf, Malayalam: \u0d2a\u0d1a\u0d4d\u0d1a\u0d1f\u0d3f) which generally refers to traditional South Indian sauces or chutneys served as side dishes. Roughly translated, it refers to a plant which has been pounded or crushed.[3] Pachadis are made of fresh vegetables and are served on the side for dishes like idli, dosa, and pesarattu. Many kinds of vegetables are included. Sometimes the rind of a vegetable is used, such as the peel of the ridged gourd, known as beerapottu pachadi[4] in Telugu. In Tamil Nadu, thogayal or thuvayal (Tamil) are preparations similar to chutney but with a pasty consistency. In Kerala it is also called chammanthi and in Telangana it is called tokku or also pacchadi. Thengai chutney, a coconut-based chutney, is the one being referred to when only 'chutney' is said. Medicinal plants that are believed to have a beneficial effect are sometimes made into chutneys, for example pirandai thuvayal[5] or ridged gourd chutney (peerkangai thuvayal or beerakaaya tokku).[6] Bitter gourd can also serve as a base for a chutney which is like a relish[7] or, as a dried powder.[8] Occasionally, chutneys that contrast in taste and colour can be served together\u2014a favourite combination being a green mint and chili chutney with a contrasting sweet brown tamarind and date chutney.[9][10][11][12][13] Chutneys may be ground with a mortar and pestle or an ammikkal (Tamil). Spices are added and ground, usually in a particular order; the wet paste thus made is saut\u00e9ed in vegetable oil, usually gingelly (sesame) or peanut oil. Electric blenders or food processors can be used as labour-saving alternatives to the stone grinding technique. Western-style chutneys are usually fruit, vinegar, and sugar cooked down to a reduction, with added flavourings. These may include sugar, salt, garlic, tamarind, onion or ginger.[14] Western-style chutneys originated from Anglo-Indians at the time of the British Raj. They recreated Indian chutneys using English orchard fruits\u2014sour cooking apples and rhubarb, for example. They would often contain dried fruit: raisins, currants, and sultanas. They were a way to use a glut of ripened fruit and preserving techniques were similar to sweet fruit preserves using approximately an equal weight of fruit and sugar, the vinegar and sugar acting as preservatives. South Indian chutney powders are made from roasted dried lentils to be sprinkled on idlis and dosas.[15] Peanut chutneys can be made wet or as a dry powder.[16][17] Spices commonly used in chutneys include fenugreek, coriander (also called cilantro), cumin, and asafoetida (hing). Other prominent ingredients and combinations include coriander, capsicum, mint (coriander and mint chutneys are often called \u0939\u0930\u093e hara chutney, Hindi for \"green\"), Tamarind or imli (often called meethi chutney, as \u092e\u093f\u0920\u093e\u0908 meethi in Hindi means \"sweet\"), sooth (or saunth, made with dates and ginger), coconut, onion, prune, tomato, red chili, green chili, mango, lime (made from whole, unripe limes), garlic, coconut, peanut, dahi (yogurt), green tomato, dhaniya pudina (cilantro and mint), peanut (shengdana chutney in Marathi), ginger, red chili powder, tomato onion chutney,[18] cilantro, mint coconut chutney,[19] and apricot.[20] A common chutney variant in Anglo-Indian cuisine uses a tart fruit such as sharp apples, rhubarb or damson pickle made milder by an equal weight of sugar (usually demerara, turbinado or brown sugar to replace jaggery in some Indian sweet chutneys). Vinegar was added to the recipe for English-style chutney that traditionally aims to give a long shelf life so that autumn fruit can be preserved for use throughout the year (as are jams, jellies and pickles) or to be sold as a commercial product. Indian pickles use mustard oil as a pickling agent, but Anglo-Indian style chutney uses malt or cider vinegar which produces a milder product. In Western cuisine, chutney is often eaten with hard cheese or with cold meats and fowl, typically in cold pub lunches.[21] Major Grey's Chutney is a type of sweet and spicy chutney popular in the United States. The recipe was reportedly created by a 19th-century British Army officer of the same name (likely apocryphal) who presumably had resided for a period of time in the Raj. Its characteristic ingredients are mango, raisins, vinegar, lime juice, onion, tamarind extract, sweetening and spices. Several companies produce a Major Grey's Chutney, in India, the UK and the US. Similar in preparation and usage to a pickle, simple spiced chutneys can be dated to 500 BC.[22] Originating in India,[23] As greater imports of foreign and varied foods increased into northern Europe, chutney fell out of favour in Britain. This combined with a greater ability to refrigerate fresh foods and an increasing number of glasshouses meant the British consumption of chutney and pickle was relegated to army usage and individuals residing in colonial India. Chutney resurged in popularity in England around the 1780s as an appetizer. Diego \u00c1lvarez Chanca brought back chili peppers from the Americas to Spain in 1493. He had sailed with Columbus. After discovering their medicinal properties, Chanca developed a chutney to administer them. In the early 17th century, officials of the East India Company on the Indian subcontinent subsisted on preserved foodstuffs such as lime pickles, chutneys and marmalades. (Marmalades proved unpopular due to their sweetness. They were also rare due to a lack of available sugar.) Beginning in the 17th century, fruit chutneys were shipped to various European countries as luxury goods. These imitations were called \"mangoed\" fruits or vegetables, the word 'chutney' being associated with the working class in these countries.[22] Major Grey's Chutney is thought to have been developed by a British officer who had travelled to the Indian subcontinent. The formula was eventually sold to Crosse and Blackwell, a major British food manufacturer, probably in the early 1800s.[24] In the 19th century, types of chutney like Major Grey's or Bengal Club that catered to Western tastes were shipped to Europe from the Indian subcontinent. Generally, these chutneys are fruit, vinegar, and sugar cooked down to a reduction. Thambuli is a type of sauce or chutney eaten in the Indian state of Karnataka. Thambuli is a curd based dish and is usually consumed with hot rice along with hot sambar. Thambuli is derived from the Kannada word thampu (\u0ca4\u0c82\u0caa\u0cc1+\u0cb9\u0cc1\u0cb3\u0cbf ---->\u0ca4\u0c82\u0cac\u0cc1\u0cb3\u0cbf), meaning cool/cold. It is made mostly from greens and carrots, beetroot like vegetables as their main ingredients. It is prepared by grinding the vegetable with the spices and then mixing it with yogurt. All ingredients are used raw (as they are) without any cooking. Thambuli/Tambli/Tambuli is a form of sauce or chutney. There are many varieties of Thumbuli: Menthe Thumbuli, shunti (ginger) thaumbuli, and various other herbal thambulis. The herbal thambuli is prepared with leaves like Basale soppu, kaki kudi soppu, doddapatre soppu (all of them grown in all over Karnataka). Many different seasonal vegetables/herbs can be used in the preparation of thambulis, such as doddapatre leaves (ajwain leaves/karibevu leaves), coriander leaves, poppy seeds, curry leaves and so on. Various recipes for the same exist, with slight variations in the ingredients. Thambuli/Tambli is generally prepared mild and not spicy. Fundamentally, thambuli/tambli has a few simple whole spices, roasted and ground with seasonal vegetables or herbs (some with coconut) added to buttermilk/curds. Tambuli is another authentic Karnataka recipe. In Tamil Nadu, pachadi is eaten fresh and typically made of finely chopped and boiled vegetables such as cucumber or ash gourd, with coconut, green or red chillis and fried in oil with mustard seeds, ginger and curry leaves. Pachadi is commonly eaten with rice and lentil curry. In Kerala, pachadi is prepared in curd similar to Tamil Nadu. Along with sour Pachadi, there exists a sweet variant in Kerala, made with pineapple, grapes or pumpkin.[27] Many varieties made of the same key recipe exist in different parts of Kerala. It is served at restaurants along with vegetable thali rice. It is also included with Sadhya, especially with Kerala Sadhya popular during Onam and Vishu festivals. In Trinidad and Tobago, chutneys are mostly made from green mangoes, coconut or tamarind.[28] An eponymous music genre developed in the country.",
    "Palak Paneer": " Palak paneer (pronounced [pa\u02d0l\u0259k p\u0259ni\u02d0\u027e]) or palak chhena[1] is an Indian dish[2] consisting of chhena[3] or paneer in a thick paste made from pur\u00e9ed spinach, called palak in Hindi, Marathi, Gujarati, and other Indian languages.[4][5][6] The terms palak chhena and saag chhena are sometimes used interchangeably in restaurants in the Anglosphere. However, saag chhena is different from traditional palak chhena in that it contains other green leafy vegetables, such as mustard greens, whereas palak paneer only contains spinach.[7][8][9] Dhaba restaurants often specialize in palak chhena. Palak paneer is prepared by first boiling and pureeing spinach. The puree is then mixed with saut\u00e9ed tomatoes and onions. Grilled cubes of paneer are then added to the puree. Palak paneer is typically spiced with ginger, garlic, tomatoes, garam masala, turmeric, chili powder and cumin.[10][9][11][12] Palak paneer is served hot with a side dish such as roti, naan, parathas, makki ki roti, or boiled rice. It can also be served with onions on the side for a more traditional approach. In recent years, there have been fusion variations of palak paneer. In July 2020, a Bangalore-based food blogger posted her variation of palak paneer idli. The dish sparked conversation on Twitter and Instagram about the unusual combination of these two North and South Indian dishes.[13][14] Food portal  This Indian cuisine\u2013related article is a stub.

It is also used in the other cuisines such as those of Bangladesh and Northeastern India, especially in the cuisines of Bhojpur,[1] Mithila, Odisha, Assam, Bengal and Nepal. The name literally means \"five spices\". All of the spices in panch phoron are seeds. Typically, panch phoron consists of cumin seed (jeera), nigella seed (kalonji), fenugreek seed (methi), wild celery seed (radhuni or joni in Assamese) and fennel seed (sauf) in equal parts.[2] Some cooks prefer to use a smaller proportion of fenugreek seeds, because of their mildly bitter taste.[3]",
    "Panchamrit": "Panchamrita (Sanskrit: \u092a\u091e\u094d\u091a\u093e\u092e\u0943\u0924, lit.\u2009'five Am\u1e5btas') is a mixture of five foods used in Hindu as well as Jain worship and puja and Abhi\u1e63eka[1] It is often used as an offering during pooja post which it is distributed as prasad.[2] The main ingredients typically include honey(\u092e\u0927\u0941), sugar(\u0936\u0930\u094d\u0915\u0930\u093e), cow milk(\u0926\u0941\u0917\u094d\u0927), curd(\u0926\u0927\u093f) and ghee(\u0918\u0943\u0924)[3] The Abhi\u1e63eka starts with ghee. A conch full of cow's ghee is poured on the head of the idol and it flows down up to feet. Then milk, curd, honey and sugar are poured.[4] While it has to be noted that variety of additional regional ingredients such as, cardamom, banana, tender coconut, and dates are used,[5] the five base ingredients remain the same across all of India. In Tamil Nadu, Panchamritam (Tamil: \u0baa\u0b9e\u0bcd\u0b9a\u0bbe\u0bae\u0bbf\u0bb0\u0bcd\u0ba4\u0bae\u0bcd) is a mixture of banana, ghee, honey, jaggery and cardamom.

    "Paneer": " Paneer (pronounced [/p\u0259\u02c8ni\u02d0r/ /puni:r/]), also known as ponir (pronounced [po\u032fni\u032fr]), is a fresh acid-set cheese common in cuisine of the Indian subcontinent made from full-fat buffalo milk or cow milk.[1] It is a non-aged, non-melting soft cheese made by curdling milk with a fruit- or vegetable-derived acid, such as lemon juice. Paneer was predominantly used in most North Indian dishes and is now commonly used throughout India due to its versatility as an ingredient in diverse dishes. The word paneer entered English from the Hindi-Urdu term pan\u012br, which comes from Persian panir (\u067e\u0646\u06cc\u0631) 'cheese', which comes from Old Iranian.[2][3] Armenian panir (\u057a\u0561\u0576\u056b\u0580), Azerbaijani pendir, Bengali ponir (\u09aa\u09a8\u09bf\u09b0), Turkish peynir and Turkmen pe\u00fdnir, all derived from Persian panir, also refer to cheese of any type.[4] The origin of paneer is debated. Ancient Indian, Afghan-Iranian and Portuguese origins have been proposed for paneer.[5][6] Legends about Krishna make several references to milk, butter, ghee and dahi (yogurt), but do not mention sour milk cheese.[7] According to Arthur Berriedale Keith, a kind of cheese is \"perhaps referred to\" in Rigveda 6.48.18.[8] However, Otto Schrader (1890) believes that the Rigveda only mentions \"a skin of sour milk, not cheese in the proper sense\".[9] Vedic literature refers to a substance that is interpreted by some authors, such as K. T. Achaya, Om Prakash and Sanjeev Kapoor, as a possible form of paneer, but without definitive evidence.[5] Catherine Donnelly, author of The Oxford Companion to Cheese (2016), mentions that Vedic literature refers to cheese production made with the aid of barks of palash tree (Butea monosperma), fruits like jujube (Ziziphus mauritiana) and creeper like putika with coagulating enzymes, \"as well as Dadhanvat, a cheese-like substance made with and without pores\". According to Catherine Donnelly, these plant substances may have contained rennet-like enzymes and notes that the \"Vedas may include some of the earliest known references to rennet-coagulated cheeses\".[10] Lokopakara text dated to the 10th century gives two recipes for coagulated cheeses made from buffalo milk for making sweets using plants and roots. According to the text, buffalo milk was coagulated using roots of amaranth plant or leaves of marsh barbel (Hygrophila auriculata); the soft cheese produced in this manner was called Haluvuga. In the second recipe, buffalo milk was coagulated with Indian mallow (Abutilon indicum) or country mallow (Sida cordifolia) and was made into balls for sweets.[11] Manasollasa, a Sanskrit-language text by the 12th-century king Someshvara III, describes Kshiraprakara, a similar sweet food prepared from milk solids after separating boiled milk using a sour substance.[12] Another theory is that like the word itself, paneer originated in Persianate lands and spread to the Indian subcontinent under Muslim rule.[13] Paneer, according to this theory, was developed and moulded to suit local tastes under these rulers, and the Delhi Sultanate and Mughal Empire are when paneer as currently known developed. Another theory states that paneer is Afghan in origin and spread to India from the lands that make up Afghanistan.[13] National Dairy Research Institute states that paneer was introduced into India by Afghan and Iranian invaders.[14] Based on texts such as Charaka Samhita, BN Mathur wrote that the earliest evidence of a heat-acid coagulated milk product in India can be traced to 75\u2013300 CE, in the Kushan-Satavahana era.[15] Sunil Kumar et al.(2011) interpret this product as the present-day paneer. According to them, paneer is indigenous to the north-western part of South Asia and was introduced in India by Afghan and Iranian travellers.[1] Another theory is that the Portuguese may have introduced the technique of \"breaking\" milk with acid to Bengal in the 17th century. Thus, according to this theory, Indian acid-set cheeses such as paneer and chhena were first prepared in Bengal, under Portuguese influence.[7][16][17] A type of smoked cheese called Bandel cheese was introduced by the Portuguese in Bengal, which is distinct from paneer.[18] Paneer is prepared by adding food acid, such as lemon juice, vinegar, citric acid or dahi (yogurt),[21] to hot milk to separate the curds from the whey. The curds are drained in muslin or cheesecloth and the excess water is pressed out. The resulting paneer is dipped in chilled water for 2\u20133 hours to improve its texture and appearance. From this point, the preparation of paneer diverges based on its use and regional tradition. In North Indian cuisines, the curds are wrapped in cloth, placed under a heavy weight such as a stone slab for two to three hours, and then cut into cubes for use in curries. Pressing for a shorter time (approximately 20 minutes) results in a softer, fluffier cheese. In Bengali, Odia and other East Indian cuisines, the chhena are beaten or kneaded by hand into a dough-like consistency, heavily salted and hardened to produce paneer (called ponir), which is typically eaten in slices at teatime with biscuits or various types of bread, deep-fried in a light batter or used in cooking. In the area surrounding the city of Surat in Gujarat, surti paneer is made by draining the curds and ripening them in whey for 12 to 36 hours. Paneer is the most common type of cheese used in traditional cuisines from the Indian subcontinent. It is sometimes wrapped in dough and deep-fried or served with either spinach (palak paneer) or peas (mattar paneer). Paneer dishes can be sweet, like shahi paneer, or spicy/hot, like chilli paneer. Some paneer recipes include: Anari, a fresh mild whey cheese produced in Cyprus, is very similar in taste and texture to fresh Indian paneer. Circassian cheese is produced using a similar method and is close in consistency to paneer, but is usually salted. Farmer cheese (pressed curds) and firm versions of quark are similar except that they are made from cultured milk and may be salted. Although many Indians translate \"paneer\" into \"cottage cheese\", cottage cheese is made using rennet extracted from the stomach of ruminants, and cow's skim milk. Queso blanco or queso fresco are often recommended as substitutes in the Americas and Spain as they are more commercially available in many American markets. Queso blanco can be a closer match, as it is acid-set while queso fresco frequently uses rennet at a lower temperature. Both are generally salted, unlike paneer. It is also similar to unsalted halloumi.",
    "Paneer Butter Masala": "Shahi paneer or Paneer Rajwadi[1] or Chhena Rajwadi or Raajsi Chhena is a preparation of chhena or paneer, native to the Indian subcontinent, consisting of a thick gravy of cream, tomatoes and Indian spices. This dish is prepared by emulsifying tomatoes, onions, ground cashews, clarified butter and cream into a curry, with the addition of chhena/paneer cubes and a variety of spices. It is mainly eaten with traditional Indian flat-breads like tawa roti or tandoori roti, rice and bread. Chhena and Paneer are terms for Indian cottage cheese, and Rajwadi and shahi are terms for royal. Similar dishes include paneer butter masala and Kadai paneer. The subtle difference between paneer butter masala and shahi paneer is that more of whole spices are used in paneer butter masala, whereas shahi paneer has a sweeter taste when compared to paneer butter masala.[2]",

It is a common street food in the Indian subcontinent. It is often spiced with tamarind chutney, chili powder, or chaat masala.[2][3][4] Panipuri has many regional names in the Indian subcontinent:[1][5] Maharashtra and South India: panipuri; Haryana: pani-patashi; Madhya Pradesh: fulki; Uttar Pradesh: pani-ke-batashe/padake; Assam: phuska/puska; Gujarat: pakodi; Odisha: gup-chup; Delhi: golgappa; Bengal and Bihar: phuchka. According to culinary anthropologist Kurush Dalal, chaat originated in the North Indian region of what is now Bihar. Gol Gappa originated in India. He also noted that it possibly originated from Raj-Kachori: an accidentally-made smaller puri giving birth to panipuri.[6] Panipuri spread to the rest of India mainly due to the migration of people from one part of the country to another in the 20th century.[3] On 10 March 2005, the word \"panipuri\" was added to the Oxford English Dictionary.[7] Pani puri has evolved significantly over time. Also known as \"gol gappa,\" the dish consisted of a small, hollow, fried wheat shell filled with spiced mashed potatoes and served with a tamarind or mint-flavoured water. Over time, variations of the filling and the flavoured water emerged, reflecting the regional preferences and availability of ingredients. The flavoured water, also known as the \"pani,\" is an essential component of the dish and is often the main source of flavour. Some of the most popular flavours of pani puri include the traditional tamarind and mint water, as well as spicy variations like jalape\u00f1o or green chili water, and tangy flavours like lemon or tomato water.[8] Some regional variations also use sweet flavours like fruit juices or dates.[8] Bangarapet Panipuri is renowned for its distinctive white-colored pani, retaining a spicy kick that has been traditionally handed down through generations.[9]",
    "Panta Bhat": "Panta Bhat or Poita Bhat (Bengali: \u09aa\u09be\u09a8\u09cd\u09a4\u09be \u09ad\u09be\u09a4 P\u00e0nt\u00e0 Bh\u00e0t; Assamese: \u09aa\u0981\u0987\u09a4\u09be \u09ad\u09be\u09a4 Po\u0129ta Bhat or \u09aa\u09a8\u09cd\u09a4\u09be \u09ad\u09be\u09a4 Ponta Bhat) consists of cooked rice soaked and fermented in water. The liquid part is known as Tora\u1e47i.[1] It is a rice-based dish prepared by soaking rice, generally leftover, in water overnight. Traditionally served in the morning with salt, onion, chili and Aloo Makha/Alu Pitika (mashed potato).[2] It is consumed in eastern Indian states of West Bengal, Odisha (Pakhala), Jharkhand, Chhattisgarh, Assam, Tripura and in the country of Bangladesh. Panta Bhat with Ilish (Hilsha) is the National Dish of Bangladesh. It is a popular dish on the day of Pahela Baishakh or Bengali new year. It has been described in documents from 17th century. Panta bhat has more micronutrients than fresh rice. It is traditionally considered as beneficial in  conditions. Anthropologist Tapan Kumar Sanyal, argues that proto-Australoid people in parts of South Asia resorted to eating the panta bhat because they cooked once a day, in the evening.[3] Fray Sebastien Manrique reported from his visit of Bengal in 17th century that the people of all communities, according to Manrique, were contented then with the daily meal of rice, often panta bhat, salt and green vegetable (shak). The better-off elements of the society consumed ghee, butter, milk and various lacteous preparations and sweetmeats.[4] Rice researcher Mahabub Hossain of International Rice Research Institute explains that in the past, people engaged in farm work preferred bold and brown rice which is more suited for watered rice, and also provides more nutrition. But, as more people shifted to urban centers the demand for farm work, brown rice and watered rice decreased. In these times of polished rice, the popularity of rice varieties like Lal Swarna and White Swarna is often driven by their suitability for panta bhat.[5] There are many variations of the dish though all are made by soaking cooked rice in water overnight. Rice is boiled the usual way. Then phaen or starch is strained away. Rice is cooled in air temperature for 3\u20134 hours. Then cool water is added in a way that about an inch of water rises above the rice. Rice is generally covered with a light piece of fabric. 12\u201324 hours later panta bhat is ready. Panta bhat retains its taste for 2/3 days. The fluid portion is called amani or torani, and may be specially prepared.[6] Care must be taken to cover the dish during the long soaking to avoid contamination.[7] The soaked rice is usually eaten in the morning with salt, lime, chili (either raw or roasted) and onions (sliced or whole) mostly for flavor.[8][9] Panta bhat is often served with fried fish or vegetable curry or flattened rice (chira), dried cane or palm molasses (jaggery or guda) and milk curd (doi).[10] Water is discarded before consumption. Sometimes edible oils may be added.[11]  Panta bhat or poita bhat is often garnished with mustard oil, onion, chilli, pickle, and served with shutki mach (dried fish), machher jhol (fish curry), especially shorshe Ilish (ilish cooked with mustard seeds), aloo bhorta or aloo pitika (mashed potato), begun bhorta (mashed brinjal) and other bhorta or pitika (mashed food). A similar dish consumed in the Indian states of Odisha, Jharkhand and Chhattisgarh is known as Pakhala (also pakhal, pokhalo or pakhal bhat). It differs from panta bhat in seasoning as yoghurt is sometimes added prior to the fermentation process.[12] Pazhedhu saadham, meaning \"old rice\", of Tamil Nadu is another variation of the dish.[13] It is consumed in East and South East Asia as well, and is known as Jiuniang in China. Panta bhat is especially popular in rural areas,[14][15] generally served with salt, raw onion and green chili.[16] It is usually served as breakfast,[15] though noon or evening consumption is not uncommon.[17][18] Panta bhat and other low nutrition food are consumed as fillers between meals.[19] Panta bhat is one of the cool dishes popular in Bengal, meaning it helps keep cool during the summer.[20] This cold and wet food, is suitable for summer mornings, but in winter dry foods, such as chira (flattened rice) and muri (puffed rice) are preferred.[21] In Bangladesh, it is a part of the Pahela Baishakh (Bengali new year festival) festivities. On that day it is consumed as breakfast by urban people.[22][23] Panta is also served at high-end eateries in Bangladesh[24][25]  Food-stalls maintained mostly by student groups on fair-grounds also serve panta-ilish.[26][27] Panta bhat on Pahela Baishakh is often served with fried hilsha (ilish), and students of Pabna Science and Technology University (PUST) assaulted their student counselor for not providing panta-ilish in the Pahela Baishakh of 2014.[28] But, the practice takes a toll on the hilsha population during the breeding season. Since 2016, Bangladesh government banned hilsha fishing and selling in the times of Pahela Baishakh, ministers started urging people to have panta without ilish and social media became rife with calls for panta without ilish.[29][30] Bengali Muslims prefers to have Panta Bhat as Iftar when they fast during summer to stay hydrated.[31] Among Hindus of West Bengal, it is consumed during the Ranna Puja (Hindu cooking worship). During Ranna Puja, panta bhat is offered to Manasa the snake goddess along with fried vegetables, yellow pigeon peas cooked with elephant apples, curried ash gourd and fried Hilsa.[32] On the Vijayadashami day of Durga Puja, panta bhat is offered to Durga along with soup of grass pea, fried taro leaves, machher jhol of blue perch and chutney of elephant apple for Sabarna Roy Choudhury Atchala Durga in Kolkata.[33] In Assam, offering dudh panta (milk with stale water-soaked rice) is a part of the marital ritual.[34] Panta bhat is also popular among slum-dwellers of Dhaka because it can be easily eaten only with salt or with an onion or a fried or green chili, without any other requirement.[35] Most restaurants on NH34, which runs through Krishnanagar, Nadia, serve panta bhat in summer along with kasundi, mustard oil, kaffir lime, green chili, sliced onion, aloo chokha, fried red chili, Poppy seed balls, aloo jhuri bhaja, mango chutney, sour curd, and sweet paan.[36] Nabanno Hyderabad, a Bengali-owned restaurant in Kukatpally, Hyderabad, serve panta bhat all the year round.[37] There are many folk rhymes and proverbs about panta bhat: shashuri nai nonod nai kar ba kori dar/agey khai panta bhat sheshe lepi ghar (lit. \"no mother-in-law, no sister-in-law, whom do I fear/ shall eat watered rice first then clean the room\"), maga bhat tay basi ar panta(lit. \"got rice begging, ask not whether stale or watered\"), ki katha bolbo sai/panta bhate tak dai (lit. \"what do I say, sour curd on watered rice), panta bhate noon jote na/begun poday ghee (lit. \"no salt in watered rice/ghee in roasted brinjal\"), noon ante panta phuray (lit. \"when salt arrives, the panta is finished\"), mude mai radhe na/tapta ar panta (lit. \"mother does not cook/so why ask hot or cold\") and bandir kame yash nai/panta bhate kash nai (lit. \"no merit in a maid's work/no fun in watered rice\").[38] In Northeast India, there is a saying Maghar panta baghar bal or panta bhat gives the strength of a tiger.[39] In a study conducted by agricultural biotechnology department of the Assam Agricultural University it was concluded that cooked rice had an element that prevented the availability of minerals like iron, potassium, sodium and calcium in high quantities, and the breakdown of the nutritional inhibitor by the lactic acid bacteria increased the mineral content manifolds. According to Madhumita Barooah, one of the researchers, \"About 100\u00a0gm of cooked rice has only 3.4\u00a0mg of iron, while for the same quantity of rice fermented for 12 hours, the iron content went up to 73.91\u00a0mg. Likewise, sodium, which was 475\u00a0mg came down to 303\u00a0mg, potassium went up to 839\u00a0mg and calcium went up from 21\u00a0mg per 100\u00a0gm of cooked rice to 850\u00a0mg, after 12 hours of fermentation of the same quantity of rice.\"[40] According to another study (ILSI 1998), fermentation improves the bioavailability of minerals such as iron and zinc as a result of phytic acid hydrolysis, and increases the content of riboflavin and vitamin B.[41] Panta bhat has some remedial use. It is considered as a \"cold food\" by Ayurveda traditions, while boiled rice is neutral. Hence is a preferred food for children with a fever.[42] Panta bhat also contains a small amount of alcohol as a result of fermentation.[43] When the conditions of preparing panta bhat \u2014 keeping rice soaked overnight in water \u2014 were simulated in the laboratory, the rice was found to be inoculated with veratridine, a steroid-derived alkaloid.[44] Despite its nutritional and remedial values, panta bhat is often contaminated, with almost 90% of the samples containing fecal coliforms with a median count of 3.9 log cfu/ml. The contamination was more in the rainy season. Numbers of fecal coliforms increased 10-fold when there was a delay of more than 4 hours between preparation and consumption; 90% of the samples were eaten more than 12 hours after preparation. Contamination increased during the rainy season.[7] A ten-fold increase in contamination was observed between 4 hours of soaking and 16 hours of soaking.[45] In cases of diarrhoea this stale rice is not to be served to the patient,[46] though boiled rice and rice-water are often prescribed as diarrheal treatment.[47]",
    "Paratha": " Paratha (pronounced [p\u0259\u02c8\u027e\u0251\u02d0t\u02b0\u0251\u02d0], also parantha/parontah) is a flatbread native to the Indian subcontinent,[1][4]  with earliest reference mentioned in early medieval Sanskrit, India;[1] prevalent throughout the modern-day nations of India, Pakistan, Nepal, Bangladesh, Maldives, Afghanistan, Myanmar,[3] Malaysia, Singapore, Thailand, Mauritius, Fiji, Guyana, Suriname, and Trinidad and Tobago where wheat is the traditional staple. It is one of the most popular flatbreads in the Indian subcontinent and the Middle East.[5][6] Paratha is an amalgamation of the words parat and atta, which literally means layers of cooked dough.[7] Alternative spellings and names include parantha, parauntha, prontha, parontay, paronthi (Punjabi), porota (in Bengali), paratha (in Odia, Urdu, Hindi), palata (pronounced [p\u0259l\u00e0t\u00e0]; in Myanmar),[3] porotha (in Assamese), forota (in Sylheti), farata (in Mauritius and the Maldives), prata (in Southeast Asia), paratha, buss-up shut, oil roti (in the Anglophone Caribbean) and roti canai in Malaysia and Indonesia. The word paratha is derived from Sanskrit (S. \u092a\u0930, or \u092a\u0930\u093e+\u0938\u094d\u0925\u0903, or \u0938\u094d\u0925\u093f\u0924\u0903).[8] Recipes for various stuffed wheat puran polis (which Achaya (2003) describes as parathas) are mentioned in Manasollasa, a 12th-century Sanskrit encyclopedia compiled by Someshvara III, a Western Chalukya king, who ruled from present-day Karnataka, India.[9] Indian parathas evolved from the dish Puran polika, which is like a sweet version of today's stuffed paratha.[10][11] Several versions of wheat dishes like vestikas, mandakas and polikas[10] have been described in Sanskrit literature. The foodstuff Paratha finds mention in the 12th century Sanskrit encyclopedia, Manasollasa which was compiled by King Someshawar lll, the then ruler of region around Karnataka.[12] According to Banerji (2010), although parathas are associated with North Indian cooking but puran poli of Maharashtra & Gujarat is close cousin of paratha.[1] The method is to stuff parathas with a variety of stuffings. However, Banerji states, the Mughals were also fond of parathas which gave rise to the Dhakai paratha, multilayered and flaky, taking its name from Dhaka in Bangladesh.[13] O'Brien (2003) suggests that it is not correct to state that the paratha was popularised in Delhi after the 1947 partition of India, as this item was prevalent in Delhi before then.[14]Nijjar (1968), in his book Panj\u0101b under the Sult\u0101ns, 1000\u20131526 AD claims that parathas being a common food in that period, however he doesn't cite any source for his claim.[15][unreliable source?] Parathas are one of the most popular unleavened flatbreads in the Indian subcontinent, made by baking or cooking whole-wheat (atta) dough on a tava, and finishing off with shallow-frying.[18] Plain parathas are thicker and more substantial than chapatis/rotis because they have been layered by coating with ghee or oil and folded repeatedly, much like the method used for puff pastry or a laminated dough technique, and as a result have a flaky consistency. Stuffed parathas may include a wide variety of ingredients and be made with a variety of preparation styles, traditionally depending on region of origin, and may not use folded dough techniques. To achieve the layered dough for plain parathas, a number of different traditional techniques exist.[18] These include covering the thinly rolled-out pastry with oil, folding back and forth like a paper fan and coiling the resulting strip into a round shape before rolling flat, baking on a tava and/or shallow frying. Another method is to cut a circle of dough from the center to its circumference along its radius, oiling the dough and starting at the cut edge rolling so as to form a cone which is then squashed into a disc shape and rolled out. The method of oiling and repeatedly folding the dough as in western puff pastry also exists, and this is combined with folding patterns that give traditional geometrical shapes to the finished parathas. Parathas can be round, heptagonal, square, or triangular.[citation needed] Common stuffed varieties include mashed spiced potatoes (aloo paratha), dal, cauliflower (gobi paratha), and minced lamb (keema paratha). Less common stuffing ingredients include mixed vegetables, green beans, carrots, other meats, leaf vegetables, radishes, and paneer. A Rajasthani mung bean paratha uses both the layering technique together with mung dal mixed into the dough. Some stuffed parathas are not layered, lacking in the flakiness of plain parathas, and instead resemble a filled pie squashed flat and shallow-fried, using two discs of dough sealed around the edges. Alternatively, they can be made by using a single disc of dough to encase a ball of filling and sealed with a series of pleats pinched into the dough around the top, they are then gently flattened with the palm against the working surface before being rolled into a circle.[citation needed] The paratha is an important part of a traditional breakfast from the Indian subcontinent. Traditionally, it is made using ghee but oil is also used. Some people may even bake it in the oven for health reasons. Usually, the paratha is eaten with dollops of white butter on top of it. Side dishes which go very well with paratha are curd, fried egg, omelette, mutton kheema (ground mutton cooked with vegetables and spices), nihari (a lamb dish), jeera aloo (potatoes lightly fried with cumin seeds), daal, and raita as part of a breakfast meal. It may be stuffed with potatoes, paneer, onions, qeema or chili peppers.",

    "Pathrode": " Patrode/Patrodo/Patra/Patrodu is originally a vegetarian dish from India. It is also known as Rikvach in Himachal Pradesh, Uttar Pradesh, and Bihar, Patrod\u00e9 in Karnataka, Patra in Gujarat, Chembila Appam in Kerala, Alu Vadi in Maharashtra (especially in Malvan) and Goa, Patrodu in Himachal Pradesh, Saina in Fiji, and Saheena in Trinidad and Tobago. It is a primary cuisine for the Konkani-speaking Gaud Saraswat Brahmin community (Patrodu). It is made from colocasia leaves (chevu in Tulu, taro, kesuve or arbi) stuffed with gram or rice flour and flavourings such as spices, tamarind, and jaggery (raw sugar).[1][2] Patra in Sanskrit and its derivative languages means leaf and vade/vado means dumpling. In Maharashtra, it is also called Alu Vadi.[3] In July 2021, it was identified as one of the traditional food recipes from the AYUSH system of medicine by the Union Ministry of AYUSH.[4] According to the Ministry of AYUSH, iron-rich colocasia leaves help to improve hemoglobin levels. The leaves contain phenols, tannins, flavonoids, glycosides, and sterols, which help in reducing chronic inflammation such as rheumatoid arthritis. The leaves have significant amounts of vitamin C and beta-carotene.[5] Care must be taken during preparation to ensure that the leaves are adequately cooked. Colocasia esculenta is a member of the Araceae group of plants (including caladium, philodendron, anthurium, alocasia, peace lily, etc.), which are all known to contain irritating calcium oxalate crystals. Only through proper duration of steaming/cooking are they palatable. Mild side effects are described as feeling similar to \u201cswallowing sand\u201d or having \u201ca mouthful of glass\u201d, sensations which can be accompanied by nausea, side aches and potential kidney stone formation, in the worst-case scenarios.[6] Many other plants with thick, glossy foliage contain these same oxalate crystals as a natural defense against animals, albeit in varying concentrations, such as Swiss chard, and there are no issues for the consumer. The vast majority of people do not suffer from any issues, as most chefs prepare the taro leaves correctly. Patrode is a unique dish originally made from colocasia leaves in the coastal regions of Karnataka, Maharashtra, Kerala and Tamil Nadu where Taro or \"Colocasia esculenta\" is thought to be native plant of Southern India.[7][8] Over time this dish has been adopted by various states in India.[9] This Indian cuisine\u2013related article is a stub.

It originated in the city of Mumbai, Maharashtra.[1][2] The dish originated as a fast lunchtime dish for textile mill workers in Mumbai.[3][4] Pav bhaji was later served at restaurants throughout the city.[4][5] Pav bhaji is now offered at outlets from simple hand carts to formal restaurants in India and abroad.[6][7] Pav bhaji is a spiced mixture of mashed vegetables in a thick gravy served with bread. Vegetables in the curry may commonly include potatoes, onions, carrots, chillies, peas, bell peppers and tomatoes. Street sellers usually cook the curry on a flat griddle (tava) and serve the dish hot. A soft white bread roll is the usual accompaniment to the curry, but this does not preclude the use of other bread varieties such as chapati, roti or brown bread.

    "Peda": " Peda (pronounced [\u02c8pe\u02d0\u027da]) or Pera is an Indian sweet that originated in the city of Mathura, Uttar Pradesh, India. Traditionally prepared as thick, semi-soft round balls, its main ingredients are khoa, sugar and traditional flavourings including cardamom seeds. It is brown in colour. Variant spellings and names for the dessert include pedha, penda (in Gujarati) and pera. The word pda is derived from the Sanskrit word Pi\u1e47\u1e0da or Pi\u1e47\u1e0daka[1] which refers to a lump of food and also a milk & flour-based sweet in the form of a lump. Pi\u1e47\u1e0daka as a sweet finds mention in Ayurvedic & P\u0101ka\u015b\u0101stra texts ranging from Charaka Samhita of the 4th century BCE to Bhojanakut\u016bhala of 17th century CE. Charaka Samhita enlists pi\u1e47\u1e0daka along with flour-based Indian sweets and describes them as heavy.[2] Bhojanakut\u016bhala describes the preparation of the sweet using milk and sugar with the use of spices like cardamom, cloves and pepper.[3] The sweet Doodh peda is mentioned in Sanskrit literature by different names like Dugdha Pi\u1e47\u1e0daka and K\u015b\u012brava\u021bik\u0103. For example, Ayurveda Mahodadhi by Acharya Sushena mentions its preparation in Kritanna Varga.[4] Another Ayurvedic treatise Brhadyogatarangini describes K\u015b\u012brava\u021bi sweet which is presently called doodh peda.[5] Modern variations of pedas originated in the city of Mathura in present-day Uttar Pradesh.[6] The Mathura peda is the characteristic variety of the city. From Uttar Pradesh, the pedas spread to many parts of the Indian subcontinent. Thakur Ram Ratan Singh of Lucknow who migrated to Dharwad (in the present-day Karnataka) in the 1850s introduced pedas there. This distinct variety is now famous as the Dharwad pedha.[7][8] Kandi pedal from Satara in Maharashtra is another variety of peda.[9] Dood peda, made famous by the Nandini Milk Co-operative in Karnataka, is another popular variety. The calorie content of a peda can vary depending on the size, ingredients, and method of preparation. However, on average, a single peda can contain around 40-90 calories.[10][11] It also has a good amount of protein, fat, sucrose and lactose.[12] Pedas have a higher Shelf-life compared to few other milk-based sweets such as the rasgulla or the kalakand (last less than 2 days with refrigeration).[13] It is attributed to their high sugar and lower moisture content. It usually lasts  3 days without refrigeration.[14] In response to this challenge, techniques like vacuum and smart packing, adding anti-oxidants, and temperature control can increase the shelf-life of pedas. Each region has its own method of preparation.[15] Some of the most popular types of peda are Doodh peda/Mathura peda from Uttar Pradesh, Kunthalgiri peda and Dharwad peda from Karnataka, and Lal peda from Eastern Uttar Pradesh.[16] In addition, there are variations with respect to flavor and texture- such as Plain peda, Kesar peda, and Brown peda. To embrace a healthier, low-fat lifestyle, there are now new varieties of pedas available, including hazelnut and walnut flavored options.[17] Other dairy products that share similarities with peda are Kunda,[18] Thabdi,[19] Bal mithai, and Kalakand. While pedas are commonly found in most sweet stores throughout India, there are also large-scale dairy producers such as Amul, Nandini and Mother Dairy that are involved in the production of pedas.[20] It is a dessert consumed on various occasions such as festivals like Ganesh Chaturthi, Diwali, Rakhsha Bandhan, baby arrivals or weddings. It is distributed especially when a boy child is born.[21] It is also one of the most popular sweets offered to Krishna during Krishna Janmashtami, the festival that celebrates the birth of Krishna.[22] As with laddus, pedas are sometimes used as prasadam in religious services. It is believed to be Krishna\u2019s favourite sweet and is widely consumed during Krishna Janmashtami. There is a popular story that has been passed down for ages of how peda was first made. Krishna\u2019s mother Yashoda forgot to turn off the milk that she was boiling. By the time she remembered it, the milk had thickened considerably. To salvage it, she decided to add sugar and give it to Krishna.[23] It is believed that Krishna liked it so much that the tradition of offering peda to Krishna began in Mathura, the birthplace of Krishna.[24]",

    "Pesarattu": " Pesarattu (Telugu: \u0c2a\u0c46\u0c38\u0c30\u0c1f\u0c4d\u0c1f\u0c41; lit.\u2009'green gram pancake'), pesara attu, pesara dosa (mung bean dosa), or cheeldo is a crepe-like bread, originating in Andhra Pradesh, India, that is a variety of dosa.[1] It is made with green gram batter, but, unlike a typical dosa, it does not contain Vigna mungo.[2] Pesarattu is eaten as breakfast and as a snack in Andhra Pradesh.[3][4] It is typically served with ginger chutney, peanut chutney or tamarind chutney. Green chilies, ginger and onions are used in variants. A pesarattu stuffed with upma is known as upma pesarattu. It is popular in Andhra Pradesh cities. Upma pesarattu is a favourite in the Coastal Andhra, region especially the West Godavari District, East Godavari District, Krishna District, Guntur District especially in Planadu regions of Guntur District, Guntur and Vijayawada cities and Visakhapatnam District. Similar variations found in North Indian cuisine are moong daal ka cheela or besan ka cheela. In Rajasthan they are commonly known as cheeldo. The first step is soaking the \"pesalu\" (moong beans) or whole green gram (a 150 ml cup of gram makes about four medium pesarattus) in water for at least four hours (maximum of seven hours). The soaked gram is then ground to a smooth paste with a couple of green chilies, a small piece of ginger, and some salt. Water is added as required. The mixture is allowed to sit for a few minutes to ensure that the interiors of the grains are fully hydrated.[5] The batter is poured onto a heated pan. The pesarattu will slowly start to get crispy over the edges and start to unstick from the pan. In professional cooking facilities, due to the high temperatures of the pan, there is usually no need to flip the pesarattu. In domestic settings, the pesarattu is usually flipped, to cook it completely. Chopped onions and chilies are sometimes added to the pesarattu by spreading them over the batter before it becomes a crepe; upma is similarly used. In some places, both upma and onions are added to pesarattu.",
    "Phaal": "Phall (Bengali: \u09ab\u09be\u09b2, lit.\u2009'jump'), also spelt fall, faal, phaal, fahl or fal, is a curry that originated in the Bangladeshi-owned curry-houses of Birmingham, England and has also spread to the United States.[1] It is not to be confused with the char-grilled, gravyless, finger food phall from Bangalore. It is one of the hottest forms of curry regularly available, even hotter than the vindaloo, using many ground standard chilli peppers, or a hotter type of chilli such as scotch bonnet, habanero, or Carolina Reaper. Typically, the dish is a tomato-based thick curry and includes ginger and optionally fennel seeds.[2] Phall has achieved notoriety as the spiciest generally available dish from Indian restaurants.[3] It is, however, quite rare to find in comparison to vindaloo (which is usually the staple hottest curry of most Indian restaurants in the UK). In 2008 in the UK, a charity competition in Hampshire was based on competitors eating increasingly hot phalls.[4] A Season 1 episode of Man v. Food in New York City featured host Adam Richman accepting a challenge involving eating a full serving of phall at Brick Lane Curry House in Manhattan.",

Dough of black gram bean flour is either deep fried or cooked with dry heat (flipped over an open flame) until crunchy. Other flours made from lentils, chickpeas, rice, tapioca, millet or potato are also used. Papadam is typically served as an accompaniment to a meal in India, Pakistan, Bangladesh, Nepal, Sri Lanka and the Caribbean or as an appetizer, often with a dip such as chutneys, or toppings such as chopped onions and chili peppers, or it may be used as an ingredient in curries. Papadam is a loanword from Tamil \u0baa\u0baa\u0bcd\u0baa\u0b9f\u0bae\u0bcd pappa\u1e6dam,[1][2] and is likely derived from the Sanskrit word parpa\u1e6da (\u092a\u0930\u094d\u092a\u091f), meaning a flattened disc described in early Jain and Buddhist literature.[3][4] Papad is known by several names in the various languages of India, e.g. appadam (\u0c05\u0c2a\u0c4d\u0c2a\u0c21\u0c02) in Telugu; appalam (\u0b85\u0baa\u0bcd\u0baa\u0bb3\u0bae\u0bcd) or pappa\u1e6dam (\u0baa\u0baa\u0bcd\u0baa\u0b9f\u0bae\u0bcd) in Tamil; happala in Kannada; papadam (\u0db4\u0db4\u0da9\u0db8\u0dca) in Sinhala; pappadam in Malayalam; papad in Marathi,[5] Punjabi and Gujarati; and pampad (\u0b2a\u0b3e\u0b2e\u0b4d\u0b2a\u0b21) in Odia.[citation needed] Papad recipes vary from region to region and from household to household. They are typically made from a flour or paste derived from lentils, chickpeas, black gram, rice, or potatoes.[6] Salt and peanut oil are added to make a dough, which can be flavored with seasonings such as chili, cumin, garlic, or black pepper. Sometimes, baking soda or slaked lime are also added. The dough is shaped into thin, round flatbreads, dried (traditionally in the sun[7]), and can be cooked by deep frying, roasting over an open flame, toasting, or microwaving, depending on the desired texture. In most Indian restaurants around the world, they are served as an appetizer with dips, which often include mango chutney, lime pickle, onion chutney, and raita.[8] Masala papad with sev, onion, tomato and coriander leaves is one of India's most popular appetizers. Papadam can be prepared from different ingredients and methods. One popular recipe uses flour ground from hulled split black gram[9] mixed with black pepper, salt, a small amount of vegetable oil and a food-grade alkali, and the mixture is kneaded. A well-kneaded dough is then flattened into very thin rounds and then dried and stored for later preparation and consumption. It may also contain rice, jackfruit, sago, etc., as main ingredients. Cracked black pepper, red chili powder, asafoetida, cumin or sesame seeds are often used as flavoring agents. Papadam is also made from rice flakes, ragi or horsegram.[10]",

    "Puran Poli": " Puran poli is an Indian sweet flatbread that is popular in South India and the state of Maharashtra. It is also known as Puran puri, Holige, Obbattu, Bobbattlu, Poley, Bakshamulu, and Boli. The various names for the flatbread include puran puri (\u0aaa\u0ac1\u0ab0\u0aa3 \u0aaa\u0ac1\u0ab0\u0ac0) or vedmi  in Gujarati, bobbattlu or baksham or oliga in Telugu, Andhra Pradesh holige or obbattu in Kannada, puran poli (\u092a\u0941\u0930\u0923\u092a\u094b\u0933\u0940) in Marathi, payasabolli or simply bolli in Malayalam, Boli  in Tamil, bhakshalu or  pole or polae in Telugu, Telangana and ubbatti or simply poli in Konkani. There is a reference to this dish in the Sanskrit encyclopedia Manas\u014dll\u0101sa in the 12th century written by King Someshvara in Karnataka .[1] Its recipe (as bakshyam) is mentioned in Manucharitra, a 14th-century Telugu encyclopaedia compiled by Allasani Peddanna hailing from present-day Andhra Pradesh.[1]\nBhavaprakash and Bhaishajya Ratnavali written by Govind Dasa state the recipe while explaining it as part of Ayurvedic preparations.[2] Holige is made from senaga pappu, plain flour (wheat flour), maida, jaggery or cane sugar, cardamom powder and/or nutmeg powder, cinnamon powder, ghee and water. In Maharashtra, Maida, Jaggery, nutmeg powder, Chana Dal/Bengal gram, Ghee, and cardamom powder is used. Sometimes, pigeon pea is used in Gujarat. It is commonly used in the state of Karnataka and Tamil Nadu as well. In Andhra Pradesh and other places, pesara pappu, chickpea (senaga pappu) or a mix is used. Other ingredients that may or may not be used are: nuts, dates, and turmeric powder.[3][4] The predominant ingredients are chana, plain flour, jaggery or sugar. 1. Chana: It is a variant of chickpea. It provides fiber, is a major source of protein, may help reduce cholesterol and also contains zinc, folate and calcium Toor dal can be used in place of chana dal and it has similar properties as of chana dal. 2. Plain flour, jaggery or sugar: These are the major sources of carbohydrates. While plain flour adds complex carbohydrates, jaggery and sugar are simple carbohydrates. The method of preparation varies from place to place. There are many varieties of Obbattu including peanut, sugar, coconut, sesame and groundnut flavours. Sometimes grated coconut is added in Konkan, Maharashtra. Coconut palm jaggery may be used. Similarly, a mix of sugar and jaggery can be used as a sweetening agent. Normally nutmeg is used as a flavouring along the coast which is replaced by cardamom elsewhere or sometimes both are used. Methods of rolling the stuffed dough also differ. It can be rolled using rice flour which makes the rolling very convenient. In some recipes flour is not used at all; oil or ghee is used to roll it into a flatbread instead. The rolled bread can be roasted with or without any ghee or oil, which sometimes is smeared after it's completely cooked. In some places, all-purpose flour dough is used after adding a pinch of turmeric which gives it a traditional yellow color. The dish is produced using a sweet filling inside flour dough. This is then rolled out and cooked on a hot griddle, usually with ghee.[5] The size and thickness of puran puri also vary greatly. In Gujarat where the stuffing used is toor dal, it is smaller in size and thicker, whereas in holige with coconut stuffing it is larger in size and thinner. It is the special dish of Maharashtra which is prepared on every occasion at every house, especially during festivals such as Gudhi Padwa, Akshaya Tritiya, Ganesh Chaturthi and Holi. It is eaten with Basundi, Aamras, Kadhi, Amti, etc. In Maharashtra, Puran Poli is eaten with a variant of Amti (flavored sour curry) known as Katachi Amti which is prepared with the remaining water of cooked Chana Dal used to make Puran Poli. Mainly jaggery is used in puran poli for sweetness. It is eaten with Vada (Bhaji) \u2013 a pakora made of all lentils. In some regions of Maharashtra, Puran Poli is served with a dollop of ghee on top, which enhances its flavor and richness. The texture and taste of Puran Poli can vary from region to region, with some areas making it thinner and crispier, while others make it thicker and softer. The process of making Puran Poli can also differ slightly depending on the region, with some using a rolling pin to flatten the dough while others use their hands to shape it. The North-Maharashtra (Khandesh) region makes it using hand and calls it Khapar chi Puran Poli or simply Mande which is huge in size and difficult to make. It is popularly called bobbattu and served on major festive and other occasions. It is one of the sweets of Coastal Andhra. The stuff used inside the bobbattu varies according to the region. It is served hot and eaten by applying a layer of ghee to it. Rava bobbattu is another variant of bobbattu. It is called obattu in Rayalaseema region of Andhra Pradesh and poli in northeast Andhra Pradesh. It is a special dish served in the state of Karnataka on all occasions, especially during Yugadi (\u0caf\u0cc1\u0c97\u0cbe\u0ca6\u0cbf). Different varieties of holige are served in various parts of Karnataka and the most common is the one prepared with yellow gram and sugar or jaggery and obbattu is also prepared using coconut and sugar as the ingredients. Opputtu in Tamil Nadu and payasaboli in Kerala is a golden-yellow sweet pancake from Tamil Nadu and Kerala. It is eaten during a traditional sadhya along with payasam. Several varieties of opputtu are prepared, including thenga (coconut) boli and sharkara (brown sugar). Opputtu is eaten mostly after lunch or as an evening snack. It is popularly sold in trains by hawkers. Trivandrum boli is also a variety from Kerala. Varieties of opputtu are available throughout the Deccan states. Hot or Cold",
    "Raita": " Raita is a side dish in Indian cuisine made of dahi (yogurt, often referred to as curd) together with raw or cooked vegetables, fruit, or in the case of boondi raita, with fried droplets of batter made from besan (chickpea flour, generally labeled as gram flour). The closest approximation in Western cuisine is a side dish or dip, or a cooked salad. It is often referred to as a condiment, but unlike common Western condiments such as pepper, mustard, and horseradish that make dishes more spicy, a dish of dahi or raita has a cooling effect to contrast with spicy curries and kebabs that are the main fare of some Asian cuisines. In Indian cuisine, some type of flatbread may be eaten together with raita, chutneys, and pickles. The yogurt may be seasoned with coriander, roasted cumin seeds, mint, cayenne pepper, chaat masala and other herbs and spices. The word raita first appeared in print around the 19th century; it comes from the Hindi language.[1] The word raita in Bengali and Hindi is a portmanteau of the Sanskrit word rajika or the derivative Hindi rai (pronounced \"ra-ee\") meaning black mustard seed, and tiktaka, meaning sharp or pungent.[2] In South India, especially Kerala and Tamil Nadu, traditional raita is called pachadi,[3] Tayir pachadi. In Eastern Nepal, the dish is known as dahi kakro (lit.\u2009'yogurt cucumber'), whereas in western regions of Nepal it is known as raito.[4][5] Raita is also sometimes simply called dahi, or \"sourmilk\", after its main ingredient, particularly in South African Indian cuisine.[citation needed] Cumin (z\u012br\u0101) and black mustard (r\u0101\u012b\u00a0) are fried.  This tempering is then mixed with minced, raw vegetables or fruits (such as cucumber, onion, carrot, pineapple, papaya) and yogurt.[6] Raw ginger and garlic paste, green chili paste, and sometimes mustard paste are used to enrich flavour.[citation needed] A variety of raita of India varies from region to region, most notable raithas are boondi raitha\u2014tiny balls of fried gram flour (chickpea flour), which may taste salty or t\u012bkh\u0101 (spicy) and onion raita and vegetable raita. The mixture is served chilled. Raita may cool the palate when eating spicy Indian dishes.[7] Raitas can be prepared with three main base ingredients: vegetables, pulses and fruits. These are mixed with yogurt and flavoured with a variety of seasonings to make different types of raita.[8] Made either from sprouted pulses, roasted pulses or other condiments made from pulse flour. Raita is served as a side dish to be eaten with main course dishes.[8] Cold",

It is a part of the regular diet in Northern India, Nepal and Punjab province of Pakistan.[1] The dish developed after the red kidney bean was brought to the Indian subcontinent from Mexico.[3] Rajma Chawal is kidney beans served with boiled rice. Rajma is a popular dish in the Northern states of India, as well as in Pakistan and Nepal.[1][4] Some of the best Rajma is said to be grown in the north Indian states of Himachal Pradesh, Uttarakhand, and the Jammu region of Jammu and Kashmir. Rajma Chawal served with chutney of Anardana (pomegranate) is a famous dish in Peerah, a town in Ramban district of Jammu and Kashmir, and Assar/Baggar in Doda district of Jammu and Kashmir.[citation needed] Going further, the Rajma of Chinta Valley in Doda district, a short distance from the town of Bhaderwah of Jammu province are said to be amongst the most popular. These are smaller in size than most Rajma grown in plains and have a slightly sweetish taste.[5] The combination of rajma and rice is generally listed as a top favorite of North Indians and Nepalis.[4] Rajma is prepared with onion, garlic and many spices in India, and it is one of the staple foods in Nepal. Rajma Masala is a popular dish in the Northern states of India, as well as in Pakistan. The Punjabi way of cooking Rajma Masala is to soak the kidney beans overnight in water, cook them in a pressure cooker and then mix in bhuna masala made with chopped onions, diced tomatoes, ginger, garlic and a m\u00e9lange of spices including cumin, coriander, turmeric, garam masala and chili powder.[6] A 100 grams (3.5\u00a0oz) serving of boiled Rajma beans contains about 140 calories, 5.7 grams (0.20\u00a0oz) of protein, 5.9 grams (0.21\u00a0oz) of fat and 18 grams (0.63\u00a0oz) of carbohydrate.[3]",

    "Ras Malai": " Ras malai, also known as rasamalei, or roshmalai, is a dessert that originated in the Bengal region of Indian subcontinent.[1] The dessert is called roshmalai in Bengali,[2] ras malai in Hindi,[3] and rasa malei in Odia.[4] It is popular in India, Bangladesh and Pakistan.[5] The original term for ras malai is \"rosh malai (Bengali: \u09b0\u09b8 \u09ae\u09be\u09b2\u09be\u0987) which derived from the Classical Bengali word \"rosho malai\" with the same meaning. The term is made with a Bengali word Rosh (Bengali: \u09b0\u09b8) which means sap and a Hindustani word Malai (Hindi: \u092e\u0932\u093e\u0908, Urdu: \u0645\u0644\u0627\u0626\u06cc) which means clotted cream hence the name of the sweet sap of clotted cream.[3] The sweet became popular and exceedingly recognized when Sen brothers opened Matri Bhandar in 1930 and shared their ancestral recipe at Tipperah district (now Comilla, Bangladesh) of the Bengal Province. Which has been granted a geographical indication (GI) in Bangladesh.[6][7] Soon in the mid 20th century, Ras Malai became a regionally popular sweets across South Asia apart from Bengal. Other variation includes Ras Malai of Kolkata by K. C Das.[8] The Sen brothers of Comilla operating under the Matri Bhandar brand claim to be the original maker of the dessert. On the other hand, K.C. Das Grandsons also claims that it was invented by K.C. Das in Kolkata.[9][10] Ras malai consists of flattened balls of chhena soaked in malai (a type of clotted cream) flavoured with cardamom. Milk is boiled and a bit of vinegar or lime juice is added to split it. The whey is discarded and the milk solids are drained, cooled and kneaded into a dough. The dough is divided into small balls and the balls are cooked in hot water with a bit of rose water added. The balls are then cooked in milk with saffron, pistachios and kheer as stuffing.[11] Different types of ras malai can be found in different areas such Rasmanjuri of Rangpur division. In Dhaka and Rangpur, the ras malais are similar in shape to the rasgullas,[12] and round discs. This Indian cuisine\u2013related article is a stub. You can help Wikipedia by expanding it.

    "Rasgulla": " Rasgulla (literally \"syrup filled ball\")[a] is a syrupy dessert popular in the eastern part of South Asia. It is made from ball-shaped dumplings of chhena dough, cooked in light sugar syrup. This is done until the syrup permeates the dumplings. While it is near-universally agreed upon that the dessert originated in the eastern Indian subcontinent, the exact locus of origin is disputed between locations such as West Bengal,[1][2] and Odisha,[3] where it is offered at the Puri Jagannath Temple.[4] In 2017, when West Bengal got its rosogolla's geographical indication (GI) status, the Registry Office of India clarified that West Bengal was given GI status for Banglar rosogolla and Odisha can claim it too if they cite the place of origin of their variant along with colour, texture, taste, juice content and method of manufacturing.[5][6] In 2019, the government of Odisha was granted the GI status for \"Odisha rasagola\" (Odia rasagola).[7][8][9] The dessert is pronounced [r\u0254\u0283o\u0261ol\u02d0a] in Bengali, and pronounced [\u027e\u0254s\u0254\u0261ola] in Odia and pronounced [r\u0250s\u0250\u0261o\u02d0l\u0250k\u0250m] in Sanskrit. Rasgulla is derived from the words ras (\"juice\") and gulla (\"ball\").[10] Other names for the dish include rasagulla,[11] rossogolla,[12] roshogolla,[13] rasagola,[14] rasagolla,[15] and rasbhari or rasbari (Nepali).[16] According to historians of Odisha, the rasgulla originated in Puri, as khira mohana, which later evolved into the Pahala rasgulla.[17] It has been traditionally offered as bhog to goddess Lakshmi at Jagannath Temple, Puri.[18] According to the local legend, Lakshmi gets upset because her husband Lord Jagannath goes on a 9-day sojourn (the ratha yatra) without her consent. So, she locks Jai Vijay Dwar, one of the temple gates and prevents his convoy from re-entering the Garbhag\u1e5bha (sanctum sanctorum) of the temple. To appease her, Jagannath offers her rasgullas. This ritual, known as Bachanika, is part of the \"Niladri Bije\" (or \"Arrival of the God\") observance, which marks the return of the deities to the temple after the Ratha Yatra.[19][20] The Jagannath Temple scholars such as Laxmidhar Pujapanda and researchers like Jagabandhu Padhi state that the tradition has existed since the 12th century, when the present-day temple structure was first built.[21][22] Pujapanda states that the Niladri Bije tradition is mentioned in Niladri Mahodaya, which is dated to the 18th century by Sarat Chandra Mahapatra.[21][23] According to Mahapatra, several temple scriptures, which are over 300 years old, provide the evidence of rasgulla offering ritual in Puri.[24] According to folklore, Pahala (a village on the outskirts of Odisha's capital Bhubaneswar) had a large number of cows. The village would produce excess milk, and the villagers would throw it away when it became spoilt. When a priest from the Jagannath Temple saw this, he taught them the art of curdling, including the recipe for rasagulla. Pahala thus went on to become the biggest market for chhena-based sweets in the area.[25] According to Asit Mohanty, an Odia research scholar on Jagannath cult and traditions, the sweet is mentioned as \"Rasagola\" in the 15th-century text Jagamohana Ramayana of Balaram Das.[26][27][28][29][30] The text mentions rasagola along with other sweets found in Odisha. There is also mention of many other cheese sweets like chhenapuri, chhenaladu and rasabali.[31][32] Another ancient text Premapanchamruta of Bhupati also mentions cheese (chhena).[33] It is being argued that cheese making process was well known before coming of Portuguese in Odisha. According to the Bengali culinary historian Pritha Sen, in the mid-18th century, many Odia cooks were employed in Bengali homes who arguably have introduced Rasgulla along with many other Odia dishes, but there is no substantial claim to prove that.[17] According to another theory, it is possible that the Bengali visitors to Puri might have carried the recipe for rasgulla back to Bengal in the nineteenth century. But no substantial claim regarding that was ever found by any historian or anyone else.[34] This claim is contested by Bengali historians.  According to food historians K. T. Achaya and Chitra Banerji, there are no references to cheese (including chhena) in India before the 17th century. The milk-based sweets were mainly made up of khoa, before the Portuguese influence led to the introduction of cheese-based sweets. Therefore, the possibility of a cheese-based dish being offered at Jagannath Temple in the 12th century is highly unlikely.[35] According to Nobin Chandra Das' descendant Animikh Roy and historian Haripada Bhowmik, rasgulla is not even mentioned as one of the chhappan bhog (\"56 offerings\") in the early records of the Temple; the name of the sweet was coined in Bengal. They also state that it would have been a blasphemy to offer something made from spoiled milk (chhena) to a deity.[21][36] However, Michael Krondl argues that Hindu dietary rules vary from region to region, and it is possible that this restriction did not exist in present-day Odisha. But at the same time, he could not give any substantial information to uphold the claim that he was forwarding.[37] According to sweetmeat researcher Haripada Bhowmick, dela rasagulla was popular in Nabadwip and Phulia of Nadia. Sri Chaitanya loved this type of rasagulla a lot and the art of its making was spread to other regions during the Bhakti movement.[38] The spongy, white r\u00f4\u015b\u00f4golla is believed to have been introduced in present-day West Bengal in 1868 by a Kolkata-based confectioner named Nobin Chandra Das.[39][40] Das started making r\u00f4\u015b\u00f4golla by processing the mixture of chhena and semolina in boiling sugar syrup in contrast to the mixture sans semolina in the original r\u00f4\u015b\u00f4golla in his sweet shop located at Sutanuti (present-day Bagbazar). Yet another theory is that r\u00f4\u015b\u00f4golla was first prepared by someone else in Bengal, and Das only popularised it. In Banglar Khabar (1987), food historian Pranab Ray states that a man named Braja Moira had introduced r\u00f4\u015b\u00f4golla in his shop near Calcutta High Court in 1866, two years before Das started selling the dish.[41] In1906, Panchana Bandopadhyay wrote that r\u00f4\u015b\u00f4golla was invented in the 19th century by Haradhan Moira, a Phulia-based sweetmaker who worked for the Pal Chowdhurys of Ranaghat.[42] According to Mistikatha, a newspaper published by West Bengal Sweetmeat Traders Association, many other people prepared similar sweets under different names such as gopalgolla (prepared by Gopal Moira of Burdwan district), jatingolla, bhabanigolla and rasugolla.[41] Food historian Michael Krondl states that irrespective of its origin, the r\u00f4\u015b\u00f4golla likely predates Nobin Chandra Das. A sales brochure of the company run by Das' descendants also hints at this: \"it is hard to tell whether or not cruder versions of similar sweets existed anywhere at that time. Even if they did, they did not match the quality of Nobin Chandra, and having failed to excite the Bengali palate, they slipped into oblivion.\"[37] Bhagwandas Bagla, a Marwari businessman and a customer of Nobin Chandra Das, popularised the Bengali r\u00f4\u015b\u00f4golla beyond the shop's locality by ordering huge amounts.[43] In 1930, the introduction of vacuum packing by Nobin Chandra's son Krishna Chandra Das led to the availability of canned Rasgullas, which made the dessert popular outside Kolkata, and subsequently, outside India.[44] Krishna Chandra's son Sarada Charan Das established the K.C. Das Pvt Ltd company in 1946.[45] Sarada Charan's younger, estranged son Debendra Nath established K.C. Das Grandsons  in 1956. Today, canned rasgullas are available throughout India, Pakistan and Bangladesh, as well as in South Asian grocery stores outside the Indian subcontinent. In Nepal, Rasgulla became popular under the name Rasbari.[16] The Indian space agency, ISRO, is developing dehydrated rasgullas and other dishes for Indian astronauts in its planned crewed missions.[46] In 2015, the Odisha government initiated a move to get Geographical indication (GI) status for the rasagulla made in Pahala.[21] On 30 July, the people of Odisha celebrated \"Rasagola Dibasa\" (\"Rasgulla Day\") to reaffirm Odisha as the place of the dish's origin.[47] In August, West Bengal decided to legally contest Odisha's move to obtain GI Status.[36] In 2015 The Odisha state government constituted three committees to claim over the rasgulla. The committees submitted their interim report to the government. Noted journalist and food researcher Bhakta Tripathy and a member of the committee had submitted dossier containing historical evidence of rasgulla origin in Odisha.[48] The Science and Technology department of the West Bengal government also started the process to get its own GI status for the dessert.[49] On 30 July 2015, on the day of \"Niladri Bije\", a social media campaign was started by using the hashtag #RasagolaDibasa and it later became a mainstream celebration as the first day to celebrate Rasgulla's origin to be Odisha.[14][47][50] Odia newspaper Sambad and FM radio Radio Choklate in collaboration with the confectioners of Pahala celebrated a rasgulla exhibition-cum-awareness event in Bhubaneswar. Sand artist Sudarshan Patnaik made a sand sculpture in Puri Beach depicting \"Niladri Bije\" and Jagannath offering rasgulla to Lakshmi.[51] It has been agreed upon to celebrate the Rasagola Dibasa every year on the tithi of Niladri Bije in the lunar calendar. In the year 2016, the Rasagola Dibasa has been celebrated on 17 July.[52] To pay tribute to the inventor of rosogolla, \u2018Nobin Chandra Das\u2019, and to promote Bengali claim of authenticity over rosogolla, from 2017 the government of West Bengal has decided to celebrate \"Rosogolla Utsob\" every year on 28 December.[53] And in the 2017 rosogolla festival, Bengali confectioners prepared the world's largest rasgulla, which weighed nine kilograms.[54][55] To celebrate the 150th anniversary of rosogolla's invention, the government of West Bengal had also organised a three-day grand \u2018Rosogolla festival\u2019 from 28 December 2018 to 30 December 2018. To prepare rasgulla, the cheese (chhena) mixture is formed into small balls. These balls are then simmered in a sugar syrup.[56] It can also be prepared using a pressure cooker[57] or an oven.[58] While serving, a drop of rose water (only organic and edible type of rose water, not rose perfume or synthetic flavours) can be added. Along with chhena gaja and chhena poda, rasgulla is one of three traditional Odia chhena desserts. Due to rasgulla becoming associated with Bengali cuisine, the Odisha Milk Federation has tried to popularise chhena poda as the signature Odia dessert.[60][61] Typically, a 100-gram serving of rasgulla contains 186 calories, out of which about 153 calories come from carbohydrates. It also contains about 1.85\u00a0grams of fat and 4\u00a0grams of protein.[62] In 2015, West Bengal applied for a Geographical Indication (GI) status for \"Banglar Rasogolla\" (Bengali Rasgulla). The Government clarified that there was no conflict with Odisha, and its application was only for a specific variant which was different in \"both in colour, texture, taste, juice content and method of manufacturing\" from the variant produced in Odisha. And the same goes for the Odisha Rasgulla, which can be claimed as a variant of the Bengali Rasagulla.[63] On 14 November 2017, the GI Registry of India granted West Bengal the GI status for Banglar Rasogolla.[5][64][65] The GI Registrar office at Chennai later specifically clarified that West Bengal was given GI status only for the Bengali version of Rasgulla (\"Banglar Rasogolla\"), not for the sweet's origin. The office also stated that Odisha had not by then applied for any GI tag, but it could also get Odisha Rasgulla's GI tag by presenting the necessary evidence.[5] In 2018 Odisha applied for GI status in Chennai GI Registry.[66] On 29 July 2019, the GI Registry of India granted Odisha the GI status for \"Odisha Rasagola\", which is the Odia version of Rasgulla.[7][8] Hot, cold, or room temperature",
    "Rogan Josh": "Rogan josh (English: /\u02ccro\u028a\u0261\u0259n \u02c8d\u0292o\u028a\u0283/;[1] Kashmiri: [ro\u02d0\u0261an d\u0292o\u02d0\u0283]), also spelled roghan josh or roghan ghosht, is an aromatic curried meat dish originating from Kashmir.[2] It is made with red meat\u2014traditionally lamb, mutton, or goat\u2014and coloured and flavoured primarily by alkanet flower (or root) and Kashmiri chilies. It is one of the signature recipes of Kashmiri cuisine. A number of origins of the name have been suggested. Rawghan means \"clarified butter\"[3] or \"oil\" in Persian, while j\u014d\u0161 means to \"stew\" or \"braise\"[4] and ultimately derives from the verb j\u014d\u0161\u012bdan meaning \"to boil\". Rogan josh, by this definition, may mean \"stewed in ghee\".[4] An alternative etymology is that the name derives from either the word roghan (Hindi: \u0930\u094b\u0917\u0928, Urdu: \u0631\u0648\u063a\u0646), \"brown\" or \"red\",[2] or the Koshur roghan, \"red\",[5] along with the word either for \"meat\", (go\u0161t) often romanized as \"rogan ghosht\" or \"gosht\",[6] or a word meaning \"juice\", giving possible meanings of \"red meat\" or \"red juice\".[7] The exact etymology remains uncertain as both \"rogan josh\" and \"rogan ghosht\" are used to refer to the dish and it is unclear which of the names is the original.[6] Rogan josh is a staple of Kashmiri cuisine and is one of the main dishes of the Kashmiri multi-course meal, the wazwan. The dish was originally brought to Kashmir by the Mughals, whose cuisine was, in turn, influenced by Persian cuisine. The unrelenting summer heat of the central Indian plains took the Mughals frequently to the country's northern region, Kashmir, which has a cooler climate because of its elevation and latitude.[3] Rogan josh consists of pieces of lamb or mutton braised with a gravy flavoured with garlic, ginger and aromatic spices (clove, bay leaves, cardamom, and cinnamon), and in some versions incorporating onions or yoghurt.[8] After initial braising, the dish may be finished using the dampokhtak slow-cooking technique.[9] Its characteristic deep red colour traditionally comes from dried flowers or root of Alkanna tinctoria (ratan jot)[7] and from liberal amounts of dried, deseeded Kashmiri chillies (lal mirch). These chillies, whose flavour approximates that of paprika, are considerably milder than the typical dried chillies used in Indian cuisine, whose flavor and heat level are similar to cayenne pepper. The recipe's spice emphasises aroma rather than heat. Saffron is also part of some traditional recipes. There are different approaches in preparation: Some use praan, a local form of shallot, and petals of maval, the cockscomb flower, for colouring (and for its supposed \"cooling\" effect);[8] others may add yoghurt and asafoetida to give additional body and flavor.[8] While the traditional preparation uses whole dried chilies that are de-seeded, soaked in water, and ground to a paste, non-traditional shortcuts use either Kashmiri chili powder (available in Indian stores) or a mixture of paprika (predominantly) and cayenne pepper, adjusted to taste. (Madhur Jaffrey's recipe[10] calls for a 4:1 ratio of paprika to cayenne.) An updated version served in Sanjeev Kapoor's restaurants uses white and black cardamom, anise, and bay leaves.[11] Many western interpretations of the dish add tomatoes to the sauce. This is especially common with ready-made pour-over cooking sauces to the point where the dish may be considered tomato-based. The authenticity of including tomatoes is disputed: some authors state that tomatoes are not part of the traditional dish or of traditional Indian cuisine and should not be included.[12] However, other authors have specifically referred to rogan josh as a dish based around meat and tomatoes,[13] while others have identified tomatoes with a Punjabi version of the dish as opposed to a Kashmiri one.[14] There is a variety with beef as well, brisket being preferred.[15] Hot",
    "Roti": " Roti (also known as chapati)[5] is a round flatbread originating from the Indian subcontinent. It is commonly consumed in many South Asian, Southeast Asian, Caribbean, and  Southeast African countries. It is made from stoneground whole wheat flour, traditionally known as gehu ka atta, and water that are combined into a dough.[6][7] Its defining characteristic is that it is unleavened. Naan from the Indian subcontinent, by contrast, is a yeast-leavened bread, as is kulcha. Like breads around the world, roti is a staple accompaniment to other foods.[5] The word roti is derived from the Sanskrit word ro\u1e6dik\u0101, meaning \"bread\".[8] Roti is made from a mixture of flour, water, and optionally salt and butter or oil.[10]  They are mixed together to create a dough which is left to rest. The dough is then divided into balls which are flattened with a rolling pin to form rotis. The rotis are then cooked on a tava or pan. Many variations of flatbreads and roti are found in many cultures across the globe, from the Indian subcontinent to Africa to Oceania to the Malay Peninsula to the Americas.[5] The roti is a traditional flatbread from the Indian subcontinent.[11] It is normally eaten with cooked vegetables or curries; it can be used as a carrier for them.[12] It is made most often from wheat flour, cooked on a flat or slightly concave iron griddle called a tawa.[13] Traditionally, rotis have also been made from the flour of millet, maize, jowar, bajra, and even rice.[14] Tandoori roti is cooked by sticking the flattened dough to the inside wall of a tandoor oven, where it bakes quickly at a high temperature.[15][16] Chapatis are made of whole-wheat flour known as atta, mixed into a dough with water, edible oil and optional salt in a mixing utensil called a parat, and is cooked on a tava (flat skillet).[17][18] It is known as phulka in Punjabi and Saraiki, and maani in Sindhi. In Sri Lanka, there is a variant of roti called pol roti (coconut roti),[19] made of wheat flour, and/or kurakkan flour, and scraped coconut. Sometimes, chopped green chilis and onion are added to the mixture before cooking. These are usually thicker and harder than other roti types. They are usually eaten with curries, or some types of sambol or lunu miris and considered a main meal rather than a supplement. Another variety of roti popular in Sri Lanka is kottu roti,[20] which is made up of  paratha or godamba roti, These are cut into small pieces,[20] small in size and rectangular or square in shape. Then on a square heating pan, vegetables and onions are fried. Eggs, cooked meat, or fish are added to fried vegetables and heated for a few minutes. Finally, the pieces of cut paratha are added. These are chopped and mixed by repeated pounding using heavy iron blades/spatula, the sound of which can be heard from a long distance. Depending upon what ingredients are used, the variations are vegetable, egg, chicken, beef, mutton, and fish kottu roti.[21] It is sometimes prepared and served as a fast food dish.[21] Godamba roti is another variety found in Sri Lanka.[22] Plain godamba roti is eaten with curry[22] or it can also be wrapped around a savory filling. Roti is eaten widely across the Caribbean, especially in countries with large Indo-Caribbean populations such as Trinidad and Tobago,  Guyana, Suriname, and Jamaica. Originally brought to the islands by indentured laborers from the Indian subcontinent, roti has become a popular staple in the culturally rich cuisines of these countries. In the Caribbean, roti is commonly eaten as an accompaniment to various curries and stews. The traditional way of eating roti is to break the roti by hand, using it to sop up sauce and pieces of meat from the curry. However, in the Caribbean, the term roti may refer to both the flatbread (roti) itself and the more popular street food item, in which the roti is folded around a savory filling in the form of a wrap. The roti wrap is the commercialization of roti and curry together as a fast-food or street-food item in the Caribbean. This wrap form of roti originated in southern Trinidad. It was first created in the mid-1940s by Sackina Karamath, who later founded Hummingbird Roti Shop in San Fernando, Trinidad and Tobago. The wrap was convenient, as the meal could be eaten faster and while on the go, as well as keeping one's hands from getting dirty. In Trinidad and Tobago, various wrapped roti are served, including chicken, conch, goat, beef, and shrimp. Vegetables can also be added including potato, pumpkin, and spinach as well a variety of local condiments, with pepper sauce (hot sauce) and mango chutney being the most popular. The roti wrap quickly gained popularity across the island and spread throughout the rest of the Caribbean.  The wrap is now simply referred to as a roti or just roti.  The growth in popularity has recently led to referring to the flatbread itself (roti) that surrounds the filling as a \"roti skin\" or \"roti shell\", a practice that is now common in both restaurants and commercial companies. Various types of roti are eaten throughout the West Indies. They are most prominently featured in the diets of people in Trinidad and Tobago, Guyana, and Suriname. Caribbean-style roti is primarily made from wheat flour, baking powder, salt, and water, and cooked on a tawa. Certain rotis are also made with ghee or butter. Dosti roti is common in Guyana.[a] A small amount of fat is placed in each piece of dough before it is rolled out to make the roti softer. Usually, vegetable oil is used, but butter, or margarine can also be used. Ghee is not used in everyday cooking, but is used on special occasions, especially amongst Hindus. The roti is usually clapped by hand or beaten a bit, hot off the tava, so it softens but does not break. In Suriname, roti refers mainly to dhalpuri or aloo puri. It is most often eaten with curried chicken. As in Trinidad and the West Indies, roti can also refer to the stuffed roti wrap. This dish is usually eaten out of hand. Due to a mass emigration of Indian Surinamese in the 1970s, roti became a popular take-out dish in the Netherlands. It usually includes chicken curry, potatoes, a boiled egg, and various vegetables, most notably the kousenband or yardlong bean. Another variation includes shrimp and aubergine. The meat with gravy, potatoes, egg, and yardlong beans are served side by side on a plate, with the aloo puri folded in fours on top. In Indonesia and Malaysia, the term encompasses all forms of bread, including Western-style bread, as well as the traditional Indian breads.[29] In Thailand, \u0e42\u0e23\u0e15\u0e35 is a popular street food that can be eaten as a dessert or as a side dish. Some Thai curries can also be accompanied with a side of roti, primarily Southern Thai curries. In Cambodia, \u179a\u17c9\u17bc\u1791\u17b8 is a dessert that is sold as street food. It is similar to both a cr\u00eape and paratha. Roti was initially introduced to South Africa by Indian migrants during the 19th century, and subsequently became incorporated into Durban cuisine. It is widely eaten by the Indian communities living in South Africa, and is either eaten as a flat bread or a wrap with locally made curries. Roti is also often eaten in Cape Coloured and Cape Malay Communities. Two types of roti are eaten: chapati/flat roti and paratha/flaky roti. Flaky roti is also called Malay roti. When eaten with a curry filling, usually mutton, chicken or mince, the roti is called a Salomie. \nA roti gatsby is a popular takeaway dish where the bread of the filled gatsby, a popular sandwich is replaced several rotis and folded. Similarly as with other countries that were part of the Indian diaspora, roti was introduced to Mauritius by Indian migrants/indentured labourers during the 19th century, and has since been a staple of Mauritian cuisine and a common street food.[30][31] Roti generally refers to farata (a local pronunciation of paratha), a pancake made of wheat flour and water;[30][32] other variants include dholl puri, which is layered, and stuffed with boiled and ground dal/split peas,[30][33] and ti puri, a smaller roti that is fried and usually served with seven different curries.[34] In Iran, the two variants of roti are called khaboos[35][better\u00a0source\u00a0needed] and lavash.  These two breads (the former of which is almost exactly prepared like Indian roti) are quite similar to other rotis. Roti shops are now abundant in Trinidad and Tobago, Guyana, Suriname, Jamaica, the United States, Canada, the United Kingdom, and the Netherlands. Owing to Canada's considerable immigrant populations from both South Asia and the Caribbean, roti and its variants are popular there. As Indo-Caribbean people moved to North American cities such as Toronto, New York City, Miami, Los Angeles, and Montreal, they exported with them the wrapped version of roti. A distinct Toronto offering is the \"East Indian roti\", a variation on the stuffed roti from the West Indies.[36] In some of these cultures, rotis are also being used in the place of pita bread when making burritos, quesadillas, or any other kinds of wraps.[37]",
    "Saag Paneer": "Saag (Hindustani: [\u02c8s\u0251\u02d0g]), also spelled sag or saga, is an Indian subcontinental leafy vegetable dish eaten with bread, such as roti or naan,[1][2] or in some regions with rice. Saag can be made from mustard greens, collard greens, basella or finely chopped broccoli along with added spices and sometimes other ingredients, such as chhena. In India, it is common, especially in the state of Odisha, where it is eaten with pakhala. In the Shree Jagannath Temple of Puri, saag is one of the dishes offered to Jagannath as part of Mahaprasad. Saag is also common in West Bengal and other regions of North India, where the most common preparation is sarson ka saag (mustard plant leaves), which may be eaten with makki ki roti, a yellow roti made with maize flour.[3] Saag gosht or hariyali maans (spinach and mutton) is a common dish in the North Indian state of Punjab.[4] In Pakistan, it is most commonly eaten in the Punjab province along with Makki ki roti and fresh cow butter or Desi ghee. The word saag is derived from the Sanskrit word shaak (\u015b\u0101ka) meaning leafy green vegetables.[5] In Odia cuisine, s\u0101ga (Odia: \u0b36\u0b3e\u0b17) is one of the most important vegetables. It is popular all over the state. A large variety of plants are used as s\u0101ga in Odisha. A list of the plants that are used as s\u0101ga is as below. In Bengali cuisine, s\u0101g is one of the most important vegetables, being popular throughout the state. Most Bengalis eat at least one dish containing s\u0101g at lunchtime every day - usually fried or accompanied by a little gravy (jhol) and served with rice. A list of the plants that are used as s\u0101g is as below. [8] There are around 70 varieties of saag in Jharkhand.[9] Some are as follows: Saags (Leafy greens) are an important part of the Garhwali, Kumaoni and Jaunsari cuisines of Uttarakhand. The abundance of leafy greens in the state is because of fertile land and forested land. Saags of Sarson (Mustard), Palak (spinach), Mooli (Radish) are common[10] but exclusive saags cooked in the state are:",

    "Saheena": "Saheena (also spelled sahina or sahiena) is a street food and snack of Indian origin in the cuisine of Trinidad and Tobago. The dish traces back to indentured labourers from South Asia. After the end of slavery in Trinidad in 1840, the plantations\u2014which dominated the island's economy at the time\u2014needed a cheap substitute for slave labour. It was found in contract workers from British India. From 1840 on, workers were recruited in large numbers who had to commit themselves for five years minimum and were promised five acres of land as a reward. Until World War I, 145,000 workers, mainly East Indian, migrated to Trinidad, adapting their recipes to the supply of ingredients found in their new home.[1] According to the Dictionary of the English/Creole of Trinidad & Tobago, the term saheena derives from the Bihari group of languages and means delicious or savoury.[2] The term saheena is a collective noun and is used in singular and plural form. Saheena is an ordinary dish and is prepared at home as well as bought from takeaway stores and stalls. It is also served as a side dish on festive occasions such as Divali or Eid.[3] Mobile breakfast stalls that sell doubles, the most popular breakfast in Trinidad, often also sell saheena.[4] While many dishes from Indo-Trinidadian cuisine are popular on other Caribbean islands, saheena remains a dish prevalent in Trinidad only.[5] Two common preparation methods for saheena exist: a more complex one (roll up) and a simple one (cut up). Both are based on the same ingredients, but since the share of the main ingredient and the preparation method differ, the two types differ significantly in taste and texture. For both variants, a creamy dough is prepared from grounded chickpeas or chickpea flour, flour, garlic, onions, spices, and water. The most common spice for the dough is turmeric, with cumin and black pepper also being used frequently. To round out the taste, green seasoning, a popular herb mixture based on culantro, can be added. For the more complex preparation method of roll up, dasheen leaves and dough are layered by spreading dough onto the upper side of the current leaf. The stacked leaves are rolled up like roulades, fixated, and then either steamed[6] or cooked in a waterproof bag.[3] The rolls are then cut into slices, which are turned in spiced flour and dough and finally baked through. The dough for frying needs to be more chewy than the dough mixed with the leaves.[7] The roll-up method is mostly used for formal celebrations outdoors. For the easier preparation method of cut up, dasheen leaves are cut into small pieces, mixed with dough, formed into palm-sized cakelets, and fried in oil or fat.[8] The cut-up method is the one mainly found at food stalls.[5] An even simpler preparation method for cut-up saheena involves preparing a mixture of minced dasheen leaves, water, and industrial pholourie dough and frying it in portions.[6] Saheena is served with kuchela, a chutney, or other condiments. Chutneys are omnipresent in Trinidadian cuisine; the predominant flavours are mango and tamarind. In addition to condiments, chili sauces are used on saheena. A common eating method for cut-up saheena is to cut it up and coat the insides with condiments. In Trinidad, dasheen leaves are available at markets rather than in supermarkets, so they're less readily available due to limited opening times. If unavailable, they are often exchanged for spinach, which tastes similar,[6] or for collard.[4] When touched, dasheen leaves cause an itching of the hands. To prevent this, hands are slathered with a little bit of lime juice,[7] or the leaves are washed with a bit of lime juice. Leftovers of saheena can be used in a dish called saheena talkari. Slices of roll-up saheena are cooked in a curry sauce and served with the sauce.[5] hot",

After 1640, huge quantities of Sannas were exported to Europe.[4] Sannas, Cassas, and Bafta were among the Indian textiles exported for shirting and sheeting uses.[5] Sanna was mostly white or blue in colour.[1] Bengal's description of piece goods for the Cape market includes Sannoes in the list along with Nainsook, and different variations of Bafta such as  ''Chittabully Baftaes, and Callapatty Baftaes''.[6]",
    "Scrambled Eggs": " Scrambled eggs is a dish made from eggs (usually chicken eggs) stirred, whipped, or beaten together typically with salt, butter, oil, and sometimes other ingredients, and heated so that they form into curds.[1][2] The earliest documented recipe for scrambled eggs was in the 14th-century Italian cookbook Libro della cucina.[3] Only eggs are necessary to make scrambled eggs,[4][5] but salt, water, chives, cream, cr\u00e8me fra\u00eeche, sour cream, grated cheese and other ingredients may be added [6][7] as recipes vary.[8][9] The eggs are cracked into a bowl with salt and pepper, and the mixture is stirred or whisked.   Alternatively, the eggs are cracked directly into a hot pan or skillet, and the whites and yolks stirred together as they cook. In Food in England (1954) Dorothy Hartley comments, \"There are two main schools: one (which I believe to be correct) breaks in the eggs direct, so that particles of clear white and clear yellow remain in the creamy mass. The other school beats the eggs together first, maintaining it gives a smoother texture\".[10] Elizabeth David (1960) takes the latter view: \"For scrambled eggs, unlike those for an omelette, the eggs should be very well beaten\".[11] The mixture can be poured into a hot pan containing melted butter or oil, where it starts coagulating.[12] The heat is turned down and the eggs are stirred as they cook. This creates small, soft curds of egg. A thin pan is preferable to prevent browning. With continuous stirring, and not allowing the eggs to stick to the pan, the eggs themselves will maintain the pan temperature at about the boiling point of water, until they coagulate. In their Mastering the Art of French Cooking (1961), Simone Beck, Louisette Bertholle and Julia Child write, \"Scrambled eggs in French style are creamy soft curds that just hold their shape from fork to mouth. Their preparation is entirely a matter of stirring the eggs over gentle heat until they slowly thicken as a mass into a custard.\"[13] Alternatively, Escoffier describes using a double boiler[14][15] as the heating source, which does not need adjustment as the direct heating method does. The eggs are directly placed in the cooker and mixed during the heating and not before. Cooking by this method prevents the eggs from browning while being cooked and gives aerated and creamy scrambled eggs.[15] This method was used in the \"old classical kitchen\" and guarantees the eggs are always cooked perfectly; it is, however, more time-consuming than the modern skillet method, taking up to 40 minutes to ensure perfect quality.[14] Once the liquid has mostly set, additional ingredients such as ham, herbs, cheese, or cream[12] may be folded in over low heat until incorporated. The eggs are usually slightly undercooked when removed from heat since the eggs will continue to set. If any liquid is seeping from the eggs (syneresis), this is a sign of undercooking, overcooking, or adding undercooked high-moisture vegetables. Scrambled eggs can be cooked in a microwave oven,[16] and can also be prepared using sous-vide cooking, which gives the traditional smooth creamy texture and requires only occasionally mixing during cooking.[17] Another technique for cooking creamy scrambled eggs is to pipe steam into eggs with butter via a steam wand (as found on an espresso machine).[18] An Italian version of scrambled eggs: Uova stracciate al formaggio. In addition to the eggs and butter, cream is added, and when the eggs are cooked, grated Parmesan cheese is sprinkled on the top.[31]",

    "Sevai": " Sevai (Hindi: \u0938\u0947\u0935\u0908),[1][2] also called shavige (Kannada: \u0cb6\u0cbe\u0cb5\u0cbf\u0c97\u0cc6), saemia (Telugu: \u0c38\u0c47\u0c2e\u0c3f\u0c2f\u0c3e) and santhakai (Tamil: \u0b9a\u0ba8\u0bcd\u0ba4\u0b95\u0bc8), is a type of rice vermicelli dish popular in India.[3] While typically made from rice, varieties made from other food grains like wheat, ragi, and others can also be found. According to food historian K. T. Achaya, references in the Sangam literature mentions sevai and idiyappam around 1st century CE.[4] Lokopakara (1025 CE) a cookbook in Kannada also mentions method of making sevai and a mold-presser used for it.[5] Sevai is mostly made fresh starting from rice grains. It is also prepared from dried sevai packs (or rice sticks). Traditionally, making sevai at home consists of the following steps (with minor variations based on location and family customs): Homemade sevai is often made from 100% rice (in addition to water and salt) whereas dry rice sticks may have additives like tapioca and corn starch. In Southern parts of Karnataka, shyaavige is made of different grains with different consistencies. When made with ragi or millet the vermicelli is fatter, whereas when made with rice or wheat the strands are thinner. Sevai can be made as a sweet or savoury dish. Sevai is similar to idiyappam, in the ingredients and preparation. Sevai, unlike idiyappam, is typically broken or cut up rather than in piles of noodles. In this way, sevai is treated almost as a substitute for rice. Idiyappam, by contrast, is served almost as a substitute for appam with side dishes like curries or kormas. The presses used to make sevai and idiyappam are essentially the same. Sevai is also typically not served with curries like other side dishes but rather mixed with a flavoring like lemon, tamarind paste, coconut, or uddina pudi (a type of powder made from black gram dal in Karnataka). Called shavige in Karnataka, it can also be prepared with cooked vegetables and tempered with spices with a dash of lemon juice. Sevai is typically served in Tamil Nadu and other South Indian communities as a breakfast or tiffin dish, but also served as a dessert such as payasam when cooked in milk with cardamom or other spices and sugar. The cuisine of Kongu region in Tamil Nadu has a variation of this called Santhagai and is included in wedding rituals of the region. In the Malnad region of Karnataka, it may be served with chicken curry, unlike how it is usually served in other parts of South India. Sankethi communities also differ from the norm in that they serve idiyappam like sevai, flavored with lemon, tamarind, or uddina pudi. Other variants of sevai made with ragi, jowar, or other grains are served plain with accompaniments like sweetened coconut milk and various edible powders including powdered chickpea and sesame. In Tamil Nadu, santhakai is often flavoured with lemon, tamarind, tomato, coconut, and curd and is usually eaten warm.",

    "Shakshuka": "Shakshouka (Arabic: \u0634\u0643\u0634\u0648\u0643\u0629\u00a0: \u0161ak\u0161\u016bkah, also spelled shakshuka or chakchouka) is a Maghrebi[1][2][3] dish of eggs poached in a sauce of tomatoes, olive oil, peppers, onion, and garlic, commonly spiced with cumin, paprika and cayenne pepper. Shakshouka is a popular dish throughout North Africa and the Middle East.[4] Shakshuka is a word for \"mixture\" in Algerian Arabic and \"mixed\" in Tunisian Arabic.[5][6] The Oxford English Dictionary describes it as being of multiple origins, an onomatopoeic Maghribi Arabic word, related to the verb shakshaka meaning \"to bubble, to sizzle, to be mixed up, to be beaten together,\" and the French word Chakchouka, which was borrowed into English in the nineteenth century.[7] Chakchouka was borrowed into French from Algerian Arabic.[8] Gil Marks, while noting some similarities with the Ottoman dish menemen, suggests that shakshouka evolved from \u015fak\u015fuka which spread to the Maghreb through the influence of the Ottoman Empire.[1] Anthony Buccini noted similarities between a wider range of vegetable stews. He and Noam Sienna conclude that both shakshouka and menemen, among other dishes like piperade and ratatouille, are members of a wider family of vegetable stews of common ancestry appearing throughout the western Mediterranean.[2][3] The migration of Maghrebi Jews in the 1950s brought the dish to Israel, where it was subsequently widely adopted despite not being previously present in Palestinian or Levantine cuisine.[1][2] Shakshouka began appearing in Israeli restaurants in the 1990s.[9] Many variations of the basic sauce are possible, varying in spice and sweetness. Some cooks add preserved lemon, salty sheep milk cheeses, olives, harissa or a spicy sausage such as chorizo or merguez.[10] Shakshouka is made with eggs, which are commonly poached but can also be scrambled, like in the Turkish menemen.[11][12] In Algeria, shakshouka is commonly eaten as a side dish, and there are countless variations of it, each with their own unique blend of ingredients. One such variation is hmiss, which is often served alongside traditional kesra bread. Hmiss typically includes grilled peppers, tomatoes, and garlic. In Tunisia, a similar dish called slata meshouia is enjoyed, but it differs from hmiss with the addition of onions, cumin and tuna. Some variations of shakshouka can be made with lamb mince, toasted whole spices, yogurt and fresh herbs.[13] Spices can include ground coriander, caraway, paprika, cumin and cayenne pepper.[14][15] Tunisian cooks may add potatoes, broad beans, artichoke hearts or courgettes to the dish.[16] The North African dish matbukha can be used as a base for shakshouka.[17] Because eggs are the main ingredient, it often appears on breakfast menus in English-speaking countries, but in the Arab world as well as Israel, it is also a popular evening meal,[18] and like hummus and falafel, is a Levantine regional favorite.[19] On the side, pickled vegetables and North African sausage called merguez might be served, or simply bread, with mint tea.[20] In Jewish culture, a large batch of tomato stew is made for the Sabbath dinner and the leftovers used the following morning to make a breakfast shakshouka with eggs.[12] In Andalusian cuisine, the dish is known as huevos a la flamenca; this version includes chorizo and serrano ham.[21] In Italian cuisine, there is a version of this dish called uova in purgatorio (eggs in purgatory) that adds garlic, basil or parsley.[22] Vegan variants replace the eggs with tofu.[23]",
    "Shami Kebab": " Shami kabab or shaami kabab is a South Asian variety of kebab, composed of a shallow fried small patty of minced meat, generally beef, but occasionally lamb or mutton (a chicken version exists as well), with ground chickpeas, egg as binder, and spices. It originates from the Lucknow region of the Indian subcontinent developed during the Mughal rule. It is a popular dish in modern-day Indian, Pakistani and Bangladeshi cuisines.[1] Shami kebab is eaten as a snack or an appetizer, and is served to guests especially in the regions of Bengal, Deccan, Punjab, Kashmir, Uttar Pradesh and Sindh. They are often garnished with lemon juice and served with sliced raw onions as a side salad, and may be eaten with chutney made from mint or coriander.[2] They are also served along with sheer khurma during the celebrations of the Islamic festival of Eid. Shami kababs are boiled or sauteed meat (beef or lamb) and chickpeas (chana daal) with whole hot spices (garam masala, black pepper, cinnamon, cloves, bay leaves), whole ginger, whole garlic and some salt to taste until completely tender. Onions, turmeric, chili powder, egg, chopped green coriander, chopped green chillies and chopped mint leaves may be added in preparing kebab. Garam masala powder (ground spices) may be used in place of whole hot spices.[3] The cooked meat is then ground in such a way that it is fibrous and does not become a paste. It is then shaped into diamond or round patties and is shallow fried. The Kashmiri variation uses a proportion of 3 parts mutton to 1 part lentils (chana) and is cooked and then ground to a paste consistency before frying the patties to a brown outer crust while keeping the inner soft. Shami kebabs may be served with roti along with ketchup, hot sauce, Schezwan sauce, chilli garlic sauce, raita or chutney. Before serving the kebabs, it is also common to dip them in a beaten egg mixture and double-fry them. They are also commonly eaten in Hyderabad with cooked rice or chapati. There are several etymological explanations behind the shami kebab. One explanation is that the name of the dish derives from the word shaam, which means \"dinner\" and \"night\" in Persian. It also means evening in Urdu and Hindi. The name may also derive from the scent of an itr called shamama.[4] The name shami kebab may also refer to Bilad al-Sham, the modern Syria, as many cooks from that region migrated to the wealthy Mughal Empire of South Asia during the Middle Ages.",
    "Shawarma": "Shawarma (/\u0283\u0259\u02c8w\u0251\u02d0rm\u0259/; Arabic: \u0634\u0627\u0648\u0631\u0645\u0627) is a Middle Eastern dish that originated in the Levantine region during the Ottoman Empire,[1][2][3][4] consisting of meat that is cut into thin slices, stacked in an inverted cone, and roasted on a slow-turning vertical spit. Traditionally made with lamb or mutton, it may also be made with chicken, turkey meat, beef, falafel or veal.[5][6][1] The surface of the rotisserie meat is routinely shaved off once it cooks and is ready to be served.[7][8] Shawarma is a popular street food throughout the Arab world and the Greater Middle East.[9][10][11][12] The name sh\u0101warm\u0101 in Arabic is a rendering of the term \u00e7evirme in Ottoman Turkish (\u0686\u064a\u0648\u064a\u0631\u0645\u0649 [t\u0283evi\u027e\u02c8me], lit.\u2009'turning'), referring to rotisserie.[11] Although the roasting of meat on horizontal spits has an ancient history, the shawarma technique\u2014grilling a vertical stack of meat slices and cutting it off as it cooks\u2014first appeared in the Ottoman Empire in the 19th century in the form of d\u00f6ner kebab,[1][13][14] which both the Greek gyros and the Levantine shawarma are derived from.[1][2][15] Shawarma, in turn, led to the development during the early 20th century of the contemporary Mexican dish tacos al pastor when it was brought there by Lebanese immigrants.[2][16] The dish is also especially popular in Ottawa, Ontario, where a large community of the Lebanese diaspora exists.[17] Shawarma is prepared from thin cuts of seasoned and marinated lamb, mutton, veal, beef, chicken, or turkey. The slices are stacked on a skewer about 60\u00a0cm (20\u00a0in) high. Pieces of fat may be added to the stack to provide extra juiciness and flavour. A motorized spit slowly turns the stack of meat in front of an electric or gas-fired heating element, continuously roasting the outer layer. Shavings are cut off the rotating stack for serving, customarily with a long, flat knife.[1] Spices may include cumin, cardamom, cinnamon, turmeric or paprika, and in some areas baharat.[16][3] Shawarma is commonly served as a sandwich or wrap, in a flatbread such as pita, laffa or lavash.[1][18] In the Middle East, chicken shawarma is typically served with garlic sauce, fries, and pickles. The garlic sauce served with the sandwich depends on the meat. Toum or toumie sauce is made from garlic, vegetable oil, lemon, and egg white or starch, and is usually served with chicken shawarma. Tarator sauce is made from garlic, tahini sauce, lemon, and water, and is served with beef shawarma. In Israel, most shawarma is made with dark-meat turkey, commonly served with tahina sauce instead of Yogurt for kashrut reasons.[16] It is often garnished with diced tomatoes, cucumbers, onions, pickled vegetables, hummus, garlic mayo, tahina sauce, sumac, or amba mango sauce.[1] Some restaurants offer additional toppings, including grilled peppers, eggplant, or french fries.[19] In Armenia and Georgia, shawarma is traditionally made with thin cuts of marinated meat which is left marinating overnight in spices such as coriander, cumin, cardamom, paprika, garlic, lemon juice, and olive oil.[20] Hot",
    "Sheer Khurma": " Sheer khurma or sheer khorma (Persian: \u0634\u064a\u0631 \u062e\u0631\u0645\u0627, romanized:\u00a0sh\u00eer xorm\u00e2 \"milk and dates\")[1] is a festival vermicelli pudding prepared by Muslims on Eid ul-Fitr[2][3] and Eid al-Adha in  Pakistan, Afghanistan, and parts of Central Asia. It is equivalent to shemai, a Bangladeshi dessert. It is a traditional Muslim festive breakfast,[a] and a dessert for celebrations. This dish is made from various dry fruits, vermicelli, condensed milk, sugar etc. Depending on the region, cardamom, pistachios, almonds, cloves, saffron, raisins, and rose water are also added. This special dish is served on the morning of Eid day in the family after the Eid prayer as breakfast, and throughout the day to all the visiting guests. In its original form, it consists of dates mixed with milk[1] from Iran and dry fruits and nuts from Afghanistan which is where it originated.[5] It is modified in India by the addition of fried semia and caramelised sugar.[5] The main ingredients used in sheer khurma are vermicelli, whole milk, sugar and dates.[6] Depending on the region, cardamom, pistachios, almonds, cloves, saffron, raisins, and rose water are also added.[7] Vermicelli are fried in clarified butter.[8] Then milk (sheer) is added and the vermicelli are allowed to cook further.[8] As the mixture thickens, sugar and dates are added along with any other dried fruits.[8] In some areas locals opt to use a higher milk to vermicelli ratio because they prefer a thinner drink like consistency[9]  This Indian cuisine\u2013related article is a stub.

    "Sheermal": "Sheermal (Persian/Urdu: \u0634\u06cc\u0631\u0645\u0627\u0644, Hindi: \u0936\u0940\u0930\u092e\u0932, Bengali: \u09b6\u09bf\u09b0\u09ae\u09be\u09b2/\u09b6\u09c0\u09b0\u09ae\u09be\u09b2), also spelled shirmal, is a saffron-flavored traditional flatbread eaten in Iran and the Indian subcontinent. The word sheermal is derived from the Persian words \u0634\u06cc\u0631 (translit. sheer, Sanskrit Kshir) meaning milk, and \u0645\u0627\u0644\u06cc\u062f\u0646 (translit. malidan) meaning to rub or to knead. In a literal translation, sheermal means milk-rubbed. It was introduced to North India by the Mughal emperors during the medieval period. It became a delicacy of Lucknow, Hyderabad and Aurangabad.[1] It is also part of the Awadhi cuisine[2] and is enjoyed in Bhopal and Pakistan. Shirmal is a mildly sweet naan made out of maida, leavened with yeast and baked in a tandoor or oven. Shirmal was traditionally made like roti. Today, shirmal is prepared like naan. The warm water in the recipe for naan roti was replaced with warm milk sweetened with sugar and flavored with saffron and cardamom. In Iran, there are slight regional variations in the preparation of sheermal. As such, it is sometimes sold as a souvenir when travelling between the regions. In India, especially in the city of Lucknow, shirmal is sometimes served with kababs, tikkia, or alongside nihari.",
    "Shrikhand": " Shrikhand is a traditional sweet of the Indian subcontinent made from strained yogurt. It is often served as part of a thali (platter) or with puris (puffed deep-fried whole wheat bread).[1][2] It is a traditional dessert in Gujarati and Marathi cuisine.[1][2][3] Both Gujaratis and Maharashtrians claim the invention of shrikhand.[3][4] According to a popular legend, shrikhand was invented by traveling herders. To carry their yogurt more easily while traveling overnight, they strained out its whey. Since the strained yogurt became sour by morning, they mixed it with sugar to make it more palatable, leading to the creation of shrikhand.[2] According to food historian K. T. Achaya, shrikhand was first made around 500 BC. His book Indian Food: A Historical Companion states, \"To dewater curd, it was hung in a muslin bag for a few hours; sugar and spices added to the mass yielded shikharini (identical with modern day shrikhand), first noted around 500 BC.\u201d As seen below, this procedure is still followed today.[2][4] The 11th century Kannada poet Chavundaraya II gave a recipe for shikharini as strained yogurt mixed with flavorings and spices in his book on agriculture, the Lokopakara.\"[5][6] The Soopa Shastra, a cookbook written in 1508 by the Jain king Mangarasa III, also mentions shrikhand.[2][3][6] To prepare shrikhand, yogurt is poured onto a cheesecloth. The cheesecloth is tied and hung for several hours to drain the whey. The strained yogurt is transferred to a bowl, and sugar, saffron, and cardamom are added. The mixture is whisked thoroughly to blend the flavors and impart a smooth, creamy texture. It is then covered, chilled for a few hours, and served. The prepared shrikhand may be garnished with almonds or pistachios before serving.[2][7]",
    "Shrimp": " A shrimp (pl.: shrimp (US) or shrimps (UK) is a crustacean (a form of shellfish) with an elongated body and a primarily swimming mode of locomotion \u2013 typically belonging to the Caridea or Dendrobranchiata of the order Decapoda, although some crustaceans outside of this order are also referred to as \"shrimp\". More narrow definitions may be restricted to Caridea, to smaller species of either group or to only the marine species. Under a broader definition, shrimp may be synonymous with prawn, covering stalk-eyed swimming crustaceans with long, narrow muscular tails (abdomens), long whiskers (antennae), and slender legs.[1] Any small crustacean which resembles a shrimp tends to be called one.[2] They swim forward by paddling with swimmerets on the underside of their abdomens, although their escape response is typically repeated flicks with the tail driving them backwards very quickly. Crabs and lobsters have strong walking legs, whereas shrimp have thin, fragile legs which they use primarily for perching.[3] Shrimp are widespread and abundant. There are thousands of species adapted to a wide range of habitats. They can be found feeding near the seafloor on most coasts and estuaries, as well as in rivers and lakes. To escape predators, some species flip off the seafloor and dive into the sediment.[3] They usually live from one to seven years.[4] Shrimp are often solitary, though they can form large schools during the spawning season.[3][5] They play important roles in the food chain and are an important food source for larger animals ranging from fish to whales. The muscular tails of many shrimp are edible to humans, and they are widely caught and farmed for human consumption. Commercial shrimp species support an industry worth 50 billion dollars a year,[3] and in 2010 the total commercial production of shrimp was nearly 7 million tonnes. Shrimp farming became more prevalent during the 1980s, particularly in China, and by 2007 the harvest from shrimp farms exceeded the capture of wild shrimp. There are significant issues with excessive bycatch when shrimp are captured in the wild, and with pollution damage done to estuaries when they are used to support shrimp farming. Many shrimp species are small as the term shrimp suggests, about 2\u00a0cm (0.79\u00a0in) long, but some shrimp exceed 25\u00a0cm (9.8\u00a0in). Larger shrimp are more likely to be targeted commercially and are often referred to as prawns, particularly in the Commonwealth of Nations and former British colonies. From Raymond Bauer in Remarkable Shrimps:[6] From the English Oxford Dictionaries: Shrimp are swimming crustaceans with long narrow muscular abdomens and long antennae. Unlike crabs and lobsters, shrimp have well developed pleopods (swimmerets) and slender walking legs; they are more adapted for swimming than walking. Historically, it was the distinction between walking and swimming that formed the primary taxonomic division into the former suborders Natantia and Reptantia. Members of the Natantia (shrimp in the broader sense) were adapted for swimming while the Reptantia (crabs, lobsters, etc.) were adapted for crawling or walking.[9] Some other groups also have common names that include the word \"shrimp\";[10] any small swimming crustacean resembling a shrimp tends to be called one.[3] The following description refers mainly to the external anatomy of the common European shrimp, Crangon crangon, as a typical example of a decapod shrimp. The body of the shrimp is divided into two main parts: the head and thorax which are fused together to form the cephalothorax, and a long narrow abdomen. The shell which protects the cephalothorax is harder and thicker than the shell elsewhere on the shrimp and is called the carapace. The carapace typically surrounds the gills, through which water is pumped by the action of the mouthparts.[16] The rostrum, eyes, whiskers and legs also issue from the carapace. The rostrum, from the Latin r\u014dstrum meaning beak, looks like a beak or pointed nose at the front of the shrimp's head. It is a rigid forward extension of the carapace and can be used for attack or defense. It may also stabilize the shrimp when it swims backward. Two bulbous eyes on stalks sit either side of the rostrum. These are compound eyes which have panoramic vision and are very good at detecting movement. Two pairs of whiskers (antennae) also issue from the head. One of these pairs is very long and can be twice the length of the shrimp, while the other pair is quite short. The antennae have sensors on them which allow the shrimp to feel where they touch, and also allow them to \"smell\" or \"taste\" things by sampling the chemicals in the water. The long antennae help the shrimp orient itself with regard to its immediate surroundings, while the short antennae help assess the suitability of prey.[3][10] Eight pairs of appendages issue from the cephalothorax. The first three pairs, the maxillipeds, Latin for \"jaw feet\", are used as mouthparts. In Crangon crangon, the first pair, the maxillula, pumps water into the gill cavity. After the maxilliped come five more pairs of appendages, the pereiopods. These form the ten decapod legs. In Crangon crangon, the first two pairs of pereiopods have claws or chela. The chela can grasp food items and bring them to the mouth. They can also be used for fighting and grooming. The remaining four legs are long and slender, and are used for walking or perching.[3][10][12][17] The muscular abdomen has six segments and has a thinner shell than the carapace. Each segment has a separate overlapping shell, which can be transparent. The first five segments each have a pair of appendages on the underside, which are shaped like paddles and are used for swimming forward. The appendages are called pleopods or swimmerets, and can be used for purposes other than swimming. Some shrimp species use them for brooding eggs, others have gills on them for breathing, and the males in some species use the first pair or two for insemination. The sixth segment terminates in the telson flanked by two pairs of appendages called the uropods. The uropods allow the shrimp to swim backward, and function like rudders, steering the shrimp when it swims forward. Together, the telson and uropods form a splayed tail fan. If a shrimp is alarmed, it can flex its tail fan in a rapid movement. This results in a backward dart called the caridoid escape reaction (lobstering).[3][10][12] Shrimp are widespread, and can be found near the seafloor of most coasts and estuaries, as well as in rivers and lakes. There are numerous species, and usually there is a species adapted to any particular habitat.[3] Most shrimp species are marine, although about a quarter of the described species are found in fresh water.[18] Marine species are found at depths of up to 5,000 metres (16,000\u00a0ft),[16] and from the tropics to the polar regions. Although shrimp are almost entirely fully aquatic, the two species of Merguia are semi-terrestrial and spend a significant part of their life on land in mangrove.[19][20] There are many variations in the ways different types of shrimp look and behave. Even within the core group of caridean shrimp, the small delicate Pederson's shrimp (above) looks and behaves quite unlike the large commercial pink shrimp or the snapping pistol shrimp.[12] The caridean family of pistol shrimp are characterized by big asymmetrical claws, the larger of which can produce a loud snapping sound. The family is diverse and worldwide in distribution, consisting of about 600 species.[22] Colonies of snapping shrimp are a major source of noise in the ocean and can interfere with sonar and underwater communication.[23][24][25] The small emperor shrimp has a symbiotic relationship with sea slugs and sea cucumbers, and may help keep them clear of ectoparasites.[26] Most shrimp are omnivorous, but some are specialised for particular modes of feeding. Some are filter feeders, using their setose (bristly) legs as a sieve; some scrape algae from rocks. Cleaner shrimp feed on the parasites and necrotic tissue of the reef fish they groom.[16] Some species of shrimp are known to cannibalize others as well if other food sources are not readily available. In turn, shrimp are eaten by various animals, particularly fish and seabirds, and frequently host bopyrid parasites.[16] Females of the freshwater shrimp Caridina ensifera are capable of storing sperm from multiple partners, and thus can produce progeny with different paternities.[27]  Reproductive success of sires was found to correlate inversely with their genetic relatedness to the mother.[27]  This finding suggests that sperm competition and/or pre- and post-copulatory female choice occurs.  Female choice may increase the fitness of progeny by reducing inbreeding depression that ordinarily results from the expression of homozygous deleterious recessive mutations.[28] There is little agreement among taxonomists concerning the phylogeny of crustaceans.[29] Within the decapods, \"every study gives totally different results. Nor do even one of these studies match any of the rival morphology studies\".[30] Some taxonomists identify shrimp with the infraorder Caridea and prawns with the suborder Dendrobranchiata.[31] While different experts give different answers, there is no disagreement that the caridean species are shrimp.[3] There are over 3000 caridean species.[32] Occasionally they are referred to as \"true shrimp\".[33] Traditionally, decapods were divided into two suborders: the Natantia (or swimmers) and the Reptantia (or walkers). The Natantia or swimmers included the shrimp. They were defined by their abdomen which, together with its appendages was well adapted for swimming. The Reptantia or walkers included the crabs and lobsters. These species have small abdominal appendages, but robust legs well adapted for walking. The Natantia was thought to be paraphyletic; that is, it was thought that originally all decapods were like shrimp.[34] However, classifications are now based on clades, and the paraphyletic suborder Natantia has been discontinued. \"On this basis, taxonomic classifications now divide the order Decapoda into the two suborders: Dendrobranchiata for the largest shrimp clade, and Pleocyemata for all other decapods. The Pleocyemata are in turn divided into half a dozen infra-orders\"[34] A particularly significant family in this suborder is the Penaeidae, often referred to as penaeid shrimp or penaeid prawn. Most commercially important species are in this family. See below. Other decapod crustaceans also called shrimp, are the ghost or mud shrimp belonging to the infra-order Thalassinidea. In Australia they are called yabbies.[42] The monophyly of the group is not certain; recent studies have suggested dividing the group into two infraorders, Gebiidea and Axiidea.[35] A shrimp seems to be almost any crustacean that isn't a lobster, barnacle, or crab \u2013 Greg Jensen [3] A wide variety of non-decapod crustaceans are also commonly referred to as shrimp. This includes the brine shrimp, clam shrimp, fairy shrimp and tadpole shrimp belonging to the branchiopods, the lophogastridan shrimp, opossum shrimp and skeleton shrimp belonging the Malacostraca; and seed shrimp which are ostracods.[3] Many of these species look quite unlike the commercial decapod shrimp that are eaten as seafood. For example, skeleton shrimp have short legs and a slender tail like a scorpion tail, fairy shrimp swim upside down with swimming appendages that look like leaves, and the tiny seed shrimp have bivalved carapaces which they can open or close.[12] Krill resemble miniature shrimp, and are sometimes called \"krill shrimp\".[43][44] Some mantis shrimp are a foot long, and have bulging eyes, a flattened tail and formidable claws equipped with clubs or sharp spikes, which it can use to knock out its opponents.[12][54] In 1991, archeologists suggested that ancient raised paved areas near the coast in Chiapas, Mexico, were platforms used for drying shrimp in the sun, and that adjacent clay hearths were used to dry the shrimp when there was no sun.[60][61] The evidence was circumstantial, because the chitinous shells of shrimp are so thin they degrade rapidly, leaving no fossil remains. In 1985 Quitmyer and others found direct evidence dating back to 600 AD for shrimping off the southeastern coast of North America, by successfully identifying shrimp from the archaeological remains of their mandibles (jaws).[62][63][64] Clay vessels with shrimp decorations have been found in the ruins of Pompeii.[64] In the 3rd century AD, the Greek author Athenaeus wrote in his literary work, Deipnosophistae; \"... of all fish the daintiest is a young shrimp in fig leaves.\"[65] In North America, indigenous peoples of the Americas captured shrimp and other crustaceans in fishing weirs and traps made from branches and Spanish moss, or used nets woven with fibre beaten from plants. At the same time early European settlers, oblivious to the \"protein-rich coasts\" all about them, starved from lack of protein.[64] In 1735 beach seines were imported from France, and Cajun fishermen in Louisiana started catching white shrimp and drying them in the sun, as they still do today.[64] In the mid nineteenth century, Chinese immigrants arrived for the California Gold Rush, many from the Pearl River Delta where netting small shrimp had been a tradition for centuries. Some immigrants starting catching shrimp local to San Francisco Bay, particularly the small inch long Crangon franciscorum. These shrimp burrow into the sand to hide, and can be present in high numbers without appearing to be so. The catch was dried in the sun and was exported to China or sold to the Chinese community in the United States.[64] This was the beginning of the American shrimping industry. Overfishing and pollution from gold mine tailings resulted in the decline of the fishery. It was replaced by a penaeid white shrimp fishery on the South Atlantic and Gulf coasts. These shrimp were so abundant that beaches were piled with windrows from their moults. Modern industrial shrimping methods originated in this area.[64] \"\"For shrimp to develop into one of the world's most popular foods, it took the simultaneous development of the otter trawl... and the internal combustion engine.\"[64] Shrimp trawling can capture shrimp in huge volumes by dragging a net along the seafloor. Trawling was first recorded in England in 1376, when King Edward III received a request that he ban this new and destructive way of fishing.[66] In 1583, the Dutch banned shrimp trawling in estuaries.[67] In the 1920s, diesel engines were adapted for use in shrimp boats. Power winches were connected to the engines, and only small crews were needed to rapidly lift heavy nets on board and empty them. Shrimp boats became larger, faster, and more capable. New fishing grounds could be explored, trawls could be deployed in deeper offshore waters, and shrimp could be tracked and caught round the year, instead of seasonally as in earlier times. Larger boats trawled offshore and smaller boats worked bays and estuaries. By the 1960s, steel and fibreglass hulls further strengthened shrimp boats, so they could trawl heavier nets, and steady advances in electronics, radar, sonar, and GPS resulted in more sophisticated and capable shrimp fleets.[64] As shrimp fishing methods industrialised, parallel changes were happening in the way shrimp were processed. \"In the 19th century, sun dried shrimp were largely replaced by canneries. In the 20th century, the canneries were replaced with freezers.\"[64] In the 1970s, significant shrimp farming was initiated, particularly in China. The farming accelerated during the 1980s as the quantity of shrimp demand exceeded the quantity supplied, and as excessive bycatch and threats to endangered sea turtles became associated with trawling for wild shrimp.[64] In 2007, the production of farmed shrimp exceeded the capture of wild shrimp.[59] Although there are thousands of species of shrimp worldwide, only about 20 of these species are commercially significant. The following table contains the principal commercial shrimp, the seven most harvested species. All of them are decapods; most of them belong to the Dendrobranchiata and four of them are penaeid shrimp. Commercial techniques for catching wild shrimp include otter trawls, seines and shrimp baiting. A system of nets is used when trawling. Baited traps are common in parts of the Pacific Northwest. Shrimp trawling can result in very high incidental catch rates of non-target species. In 1997, the FAO found discard rates up to 20 pounds for every pound of shrimp. The world average was 5.7 pounds for every pound of shrimp.[92] Trawl nets in general, and shrimp trawls in particular, have been identified as sources of mortality for species of finfish and cetaceans.[93] Bycatch is often discarded dead or dying by the time it is returned to the sea, and may alter the ecological balance in discarded regions.[94] Worldwide, shrimp trawl fisheries generate about 2% of the world's catch of fish in weight, but result in more than one third of the global bycatch total. The most extensively fished species are the akiami paste shrimp, the northern prawn, the southern rough shrimp, and the giant tiger prawn. Together these four species account for nearly half of the total wild capture. In recent years, the global capture of wild shrimp has been overtaken by the harvest from farmed shrimp.[59] A shrimp farm is an aquaculture business for the cultivation of marine shrimp or prawns for human consumption. Commercial shrimp farming began in the 1970s, and production grew steeply, particularly to match the market demands of the United States, Japan and Western Europe. The total global production of farmed shrimp reached more than 1.6 million tonnes in 2003, representing a value of nearly 9 billion U.S. dollars. About 75% of farmed shrimp are produced in Asia, in particular in China, Thailand, Indonesia, India and Vietnam. The other 25% are produced mainly in Latin America, where Brazil is the largest producer. By 2016, the largest exporting nation is India, followed by Ecuador, Thailand, Indonesia and China.[95] As can be seen from the global production chart on the left, significant aquaculture production started slowly in the 1970s and then rapidly expanded during the 1980s. After a lull in growth during the 1990s, due to pathogens, production took off again and by 2007 exceeded the capture from wild fisheries. By 2010, the aquaculture harvest was 3.9 million tonnes, compared to 3.1 million tonnes for the capture of wild shrimp.[59] In the earlier years of marine shrimp farming the preferred species was the large giant tiger prawn. This species is reared in circular holding tanks where they think they are in the open ocean, and swim in \"never ending migration\" around the circumference of the tank.[96] In 2000, global production was 630,984 tonnes, compared to only 146,362 tonnes for whiteleg shrimp. Subsequently, these positions reversed, and by 2010 the production of giant tiger prawn increased modestly to 781,581 tonnes while whiteleg shrimp rocketed nearly twenty-fold to 2,720,929 tonnes.[59] The whiteleg shrimp is currently the dominant species in shrimp farming. It is a moderately large shrimp reaching a total length of 230\u00a0mm (9\"), and is particularly suited to farming because it \"breeds well in captivity, can be stocked at small sizes, grows fast and at uniform rates, has comparatively low protein requirements... and adapts well to variable environmental conditions.\"[97] In China, prawns are cultured along with sea cucumbers and some fish species, in integrated multi-trophic systems. The major producer of farmed shrimp is China. Other significant producers are Thailand, Indonesia, India, Vietnam, Brazil, Ecuador and Bangladesh. Most farmed shrimp is exported to the United States, the European Union and Japan,[98] also other Asian markets, including South Korea, Hong Kong, Taiwan and Singapore.[95] Investigations by The Guardian in 2014 and The Associated Press in 2015 found human rights abuses on fishing boats operated by Thailand. The boats are manned with slaves, and catch shrimp and fish (including fish for the production of fishmeal which is fed to farmed prawns).[99][100] Greenpeace has challenged the sustainability of tropical shrimp farming practices on the grounds that farming these species \"has led to the destruction of vast areas of mangroves in several countries [and] over-fishing of juvenile shrimp from the wild to supply farms.\" Greenpeace has placed a number of the prominent tropical shrimp species that are farmed commercially on its seafood red list, including the whiteleg shrimp, Indian prawn and giant tiger shrimp.[101] There is also evidence that shrimps, like other crustaceans, can feel pain. Common welfare concerns include water pollution, high population densities, and the spread of diseases. Additionally, many female shrimps have their eyes cut without anesthetic in order to induce maturation of the ovaries.[102] Shrimp are marketed and commercialized with several issues in mind. Most shrimp are sold frozen and marketed based on their categorization of presentation, grading, colour, and uniformity.[103] Shrimp have high levels of omega-3 fatty acids and low levels of mercury.[104] Usually shrimp is sold whole, though sometimes only the meat of shrimp is marketed. As with other seafood, shrimp is high in calcium, iodine and protein but low in food energy. A shrimp-based meal is also a significant source of cholesterol, from 122\u00a0mg to 251\u00a0mg per 100\u00a0g of shrimp, depending on the method of preparation.[105] Shrimp consumption, however, is considered healthy for the circulatory system because the lack of significant levels of saturated fat in shrimp means that the high cholesterol content in shrimp improves the ratio of LDL to HDL cholesterol and lowers triglycerides.[106] Ebiko - shrimp roe, sometimes translated as \"shrimp flakes\" - is used as one of the ingredients in the preparation of sushi.[107] Shrimp and other shellfish are among the most common food allergens.[108] They are not kosher and thus are forbidden in Jewish cuisine. Since the early 2020s, plant-based and cultured alternatives to shrimps have emerged and have been rapidly improving.[102] Several types of shrimp are kept in home aquaria. Some are purely ornamental, while others are useful in controlling algae and removing debris.[109] Freshwater shrimp commonly available for aquaria include the Bamboo shrimp, Japanese marsh shrimp (Caridina multidentata, also called \"Amano shrimp,\" as their use in aquaria was pioneered by Takashi Amano), cherry shrimp (Neocaridina heteropoda), and ghost or glass shrimp (Palaemonetes spp.). Popular saltwater shrimp include the cleaner shrimp Lysmata amboinensis, the fire shrimp (Lysmata debelius) and the harlequin shrimp (Hymenocera picta). The terms shrimp and prawn are common names, not scientific names. They are vernacular or colloquial terms, which lack the formal definition of scientific terms. They are not taxa, but are terms of convenience with little circumscriptional significance. There is no reason to avoid using the terms shrimp or prawn when convenient, but it is important not to confuse them with the names or relationships of actual taxa.[12] According to the crustacean taxonomist Tin-Yam Chan, \"The terms shrimp and prawn have no definite reference to any known taxonomic groups. Although the term shrimp is sometimes applied to smaller species, while prawn is more often used for larger forms, there is no clear distinction between both terms and their usage is often confused or even reverse in different countries or regions.\"[110] Writing in 1980, L. B. Holthuis noted that the terms prawn and shrimp were used inconsistently \"even within a single region\", generalising that larger species fished commercially were generally called shrimp in the United States, and prawns in other English-speaking countries, although not without exceptions.[111] A lot of confusion surrounds the scope of the term shrimp. Part of the confusion originates with the association of smallness. That creates problems with shrimp-like species that are not small. The expression \"jumbo shrimp\" can be viewed as an oxymoron, a problem that does not exist with the commercial designation \"jumbo prawns\".[112] The term shrimp originated around the 14th century with the Middle English shrimpe, akin to the Middle Low German schrempen, and meaning to contract or wrinkle; and the Old Norse skorpna, meaning to shrivel up, or skreppa, meaning a thin person.[113][114] It is not clear where the term prawn originated, but early forms of the word surfaced in England in the early 15th century as prayne, praine and prane.[115][116][117] According to the linguist Anatoly Liberman it is unclear how shrimp, in English, came to be associated with small. \"No Germanic language associates the shrimp with its size... The same holds for Romance... it remains unclear in what circumstances the name was applied to the crustacean.\"[118] Taxonomic studies in Europe on shrimp and prawns were shaped by the common shrimp and the common prawn, both found in huge numbers along the European coastlines. The common shrimp, Crangon crangon, was categorised in 1758 by Carl Linnaeus, and the common prawn, Palaemon serratus, was categorised in 1777 by Thomas Pennant. The common shrimp is a small burrowing species aligned with the notion of a shrimp as being something small, whereas the common prawn is much larger. The terms true shrimp or true prawn are sometimes used to mean what a particular person thinks is a shrimp or prawn.[12] This varies with the person using the terms. But such terms are not normally used in the scientific literature, because the terms shrimp and prawn themselves lack scientific standing. Over the years the way shrimp and prawn are used has changed, and nowadays the terms are almost interchangeable. Although from time to time some biologists declare that certain common names should be confined to specific taxa, the popular use of these names seems to continue unchanged.[12][119] Only 57 exclusively fossil species are known in the shrimp fossil record.[35] The earliest dates from the Lower Jurassic, followed by specimens from the Cretaceous.[120]",
    "Shukto": "Shukto (Bengali: \u09b6\u09c1\u0995\u09cd\u09a4\u09cb) is a popular vegetable dish in Bengali cuisine usually served with rice in the West Bengal state of India and in the neighbouring country Bangladesh.[1] It has slightly bitter taste and is especially served in the banquets of Bengali social ceremonies like Annaprasana, Sraddhya or Bengali Wedding as a part of traditional Bengali thali. Shukto has numerous different variations and can be prepared in different ways.[2] The tradition of starting a meal by consuming bitters, considered to have a medicinal value, dates back to the ancient times and was promoted by the authors of Ayurveda. Shukto was consumed as a cooling agent in the hot and humid climates of the ancient kingdoms of undivided Bengal like Anga, Vanga. In Kalinga aka present day Odisha, a similar vegetable stew called Santu\u1e37\u0101 is very popular. Shukto is also mentioned in Mangal-K\u0101vya, written during the medieval period and in the biographies of Sri Chaitanya.[2][1] Dudh Shukto is a popular variant which is prepared with milk to alleviate the bitter taste of the dish.[2] Some variants are made with fish of different sizes. Such variants of Shukto typically use turmeric which is usually absent in the vegetarian variants. Some of the variants even exclude the bitter vegetables and are prepared with fenugreek seeds instead, to preserve the bitterness.[2] room temperature",
    "Siddu": " Siddaramaiah (born 3 August 1947),[6] also referred to by his nickname Siddu,[a] is an Indian politician who is serving as the 22nd Chief Minister of Karnataka from 20 May 2023.[7] He also held that position previously from 2013 to 2018, being only the second person to hold that office for a full five-year term. He belongs to the Indian National Congress and is presently the leader of the Congress Legislative Party. He represented the Varuna Assembly constituency from 2023, previously from 2008 to 2018, Badami Assembly constituency from 2018 to 2023, and from Chamundeshwari Assembly constituency from 2004 to 2007, 1994 to 1999 and from 1983 to 1989 in the Karnataka Legislative Assembly. He served as the Deputy Chief Minister of Karnataka from 1996 to 1999 and from 2004 to 2005 while he was a member of the Janata Dal and Janata Dal (Secular). He also served as the Leader of the Opposition in Karnataka Legislative Assembly on two occasions from  2019 to 2023 and from 2009 to 2013.[8][9][10] Siddaramaiah was a member of various Janata Parivar factions for several years.[11][12][13] Siddaramaiah was born to Siddarame Gowda and Boramma at a remote village called Siddaramanahundi in Varuna Hobli near T. Narasipura of Mysore district in a farming family.[14] He is the fourth among six siblings, and he belongs to the Kuruba Gowda community.[15] Siddaramaiah studied at Mount Carmel School and completed his schooling from Vidyavardhaka High School, which is managed by Vidyavardhaka Sangha (VVS), Mysuru. He then went on to do his B. Sc. and LL.B. from Mysore University.[16] Siddaramaiah was a junior under a well-renowned lawyer, P M Chikkaboraiah, in Mysore and later taught law for some time at Vidyavardhaka Law College[17][18][19] managed by Vidyavardhaka Sangha (VVS), Mysuru.[20] Siddaramaiah is mononymous. Siddaramaiah is married to Parvathi and had two sons. His elder son, Rakesh, who was seen as his father's heir in politics, died of multiple organ failure in 2016 at the age of 38.[21] His other son, Yathindra, contested the 2018 Legislative Assembly elections and won from the seat of Varuna in Mysuru, formerly his father's seat, by over 45,000 votes.[22] Siddaramaiah has stated on record that he is an atheist,[23] though he has more recently clarified his public stance on the subject: \"Word has spread that I am an atheist, which I am not. I am spiritual -- I have participated in festivities as child. I have visited some of the popular pilgrimage centres. But I am definitely against superstition, as I view everything from a scientific point of view\".[24] Siddaramaiah's political career began when Nanjunda Swamy, a lawyer in Mysore, spotted him at the district courts as a law graduate. He was asked to contest and was elected to the Mysore Taluka. He contested on a Bharatiya Lok Dal ticket from Chamundeshwari constituency and entered the 7th Karnataka Legislative Assembly in 1983. This was a surprise victory for all and it earned him a name and fame in the Old Mysore region.[citation needed] Later he joined the ruling Janata Party and became the first president of the Kannada Surveillance Committee (Kannada Kavalu Samiti), set up to supervise the implementation of Kannada as an official language. During the mid-term polls in 1985, Siddaramaiah was re-elected from the same constituency and became Minister for Animal Husbandry and Veterinary Services. In Chief Minister Ramakrishna Hegde's government, he handled diverse portfolios such as Sericulture, Animal Husbandry and Transport at different stages.[25] He first suffered defeat in the 1989 Assembly elections, beaten by a veteran Congress leader, M. Rajasekara Murthy. Later in 1992, he was appointed Secretary General of Janata Dal, which H. D. Deve Gowda had also joined. He was elected again in the 1994 State Elections and became the Minister for Finance in the Janata Dal government headed by Deve Gowda. He was made Deputy Chief Minister when J. H. Patel became Chief Minister in 1996. He was sacked as Deputy Chief Minister and dropped from the Cabinet on 22 July 1999.[2] After the split in the Janata Dal, he joined the Janata Dal (Secular) faction of Deve Gowda and became the president of its state unit. However, he lost in the 1999 state elections. In 2004, when the Indian National Congress and JD (S) formed a coalition government with Dharam Singh as Chief Minister, he was again appointed Deputy Chief Minister.[26] He addressed ahinda samavesha in Hubballi, which had the huge public gathering. He even challenged Reddy brothers in the house when he was the leader of the opposition that he would come to Bellary through padayatra. It garnered attention of whole state and eventually Siddaramaiah came to power in 2013.[27] Siddaramaiah celebrated his 75th birthday on 3 August 2022 in Davanagere and called it \"Siddaramotsava\", where more than 20 lakh followers of Siddaramaiah had attended the program.[28][29] In 2005, after differences with H. D. Deve Gowda, Siddaramaiah was expelled from JD (S). He wanted to revive a regional party \"ABPJD\" in the state after quitting the JD (S), but he did not because regional parties formed earlier in Karnataka had not survived.[30] He subsequently garnered mass support from the backward classes and joined the Congress at a large public meeting held in Bangalore, in Sonia Gandhi's presence. He won the Chamundeshwari bypolls held in December 2006, by a margin of 257 votes against M. Shivabasappa of JD (S), despite a fierce campaign against him by Deve Gowda, Chief Minister Kumaraswamy and Deputy Chief Minister Yeddyurappa in the constituency.[26] In the 2008 state Assembly elections, he contested from Varuna Constituency and was re-elected for the fifth time.[31][32] He won the 2013 election from the same constituency (Varuna) on 8 May 2013 and was reelected for the 7th time. He was elected as the leader of the Congress legislative party in the Karnataka assembly on 10 May 2013.[33] He had previously announced that the 2013 Assembly election would be his last election,[34] but in the 2018 Karnataka Legislative Assembly election, he left his safe Varuna seat for his son, and he himself went on to contest from two constituencies, i.e. Chamundeshwari and Badami, and faced stiff competition against GT Devegowda of JD (S) and B. Sriramulu of BJP respectively, both of which were new constituencies for him. He lost in Chamundeshwari, but won in Badami vidhan sabha seat beating BJP heavyweight Sriramulu with a narrow margin of 1,696 votes and he was reelected for the 8th time. Congress under his leadership then supported the Janata Dal (Secular) in forming the government in 2018 to keep BJP out of power. He was the chairman of coordination committee that coordinated the congress-JDS coalition govt under H. D Kumarswamy. After the resignation of 17 MLAs, leading to the downfall of the coalition government, Siddaramaiah took the leadership of the upcoming by-elections in Karnataka.[citation needed] The by-polls were held on 5 December 2019 for the 15 assembly seats. Though Siddaramaiah expressed his confidence in winning 12 out of the 15 contested seats, Congress managed to win only 2 seats and the JDS winning none of it.[35] This was a major setback for his leadership and differences arose among his own party members questioning his leadership.[36] Thus Siddaramaiah resigned as the Leader of the CLP and the Leader of opposition of the Karnataka Legislative Assembly on 9 December.[37] In the 2023 Karnataka legislative assembly election, Siddaramaiah contested from Varuna constituency and won. This makes his 9th election win. He was sworn in as Chief minister for the second time.[38] Siddaramaiah was elected as Chief Minister after Congress adopted a secret ballot to select the new chief minister.[39][40]\nHe led the Indian National Congress to victory by achieving an absolute majority of 122/224 seats in the 2013 Legislative Assembly election.[41] On 15 May 2018, he resigned from his position of the Chief minister of Karnataka, respecting the verdict of the 2018 Karnataka Legislative Assembly election.[42] He also became the first chief minister of Karnataka to serve full 5 years term in 40 years, and the second in the history of the southern state after Devaraj Urs.[43] He also holds the record of presenting state budget 13 times as a finance minister in Government of Karnataka. Despite allegations of mounting debt on state exchequer by the opposition, he is known for maintaining fiscal prudence within the ambit of Fiscal Responsibility and Budget Management Act of the state.[44] After the Congress emerged victorious in the 2023 legislative assembly election, Siddaramaiah was again elected Chief Minister, and D. K. Shivakumar was appointed his deputy.[38] After the first cabinet meet, Siddaramaiah announced that all \"5 guarantees\" announced in the party's manifesto had been approved and would be brought into effect in the following cabinet meet.[45] He also insisted that the officers roll back his \"zero-traffic\" protocol to avoid traffic congestion problems for the public.[46] His council of ministers was named the following week and was reported that he would hold finance, cabinet affairs and all unallocated portfolios.[47] His cabinet approved reverting changes by the previous BJP government in school textbooks, which included removing lessons on RSS founder K. B. Hedgewar and Hindutva figure Vinayak Damodar Savarkar,[48] launched a scheme providing free bus rides to women in the Karnataka state buses[49] and announced implementation of other four pre-poll guarantees in the state budget. In July 2023, he tabled the state budget for the record 14th time in state's history. He increased taxes on liquor, beer, stamp duty and registration of properties, and certain vehicle categories to fund the above-mentioned schemes.[50][51] In July 2024 his cabinet approved a bill to reserve 50% to 75% jobs to native Kannada speakers, and 100% reservation for Group C and D employees in private and IT sectors. This idea received large opposition from people like Mohandas Pia, Kiran Mazumdar and others and hence the passing of the bill was postponed.[8] In July 2023, the state witnessed series of killings which included an on-duty police constable crushed to death by a sand mafia truck,[52] Jain monk Nandhi Maharaj from Belgaum, a worker named Venugopal in T. Narasipur and a double murder of CEO and MD of a company in Bangalore.[53] This led to criticism of law and order situation within the state.[54] In July 2024, his cabinet minister B. Nagendra was accused of money transfers of around \u20b9187 crores into various bank accounts from the SC-ST Valmiki funds, in a suicide victim's death note.[55] With these accusations prevailing the minister was asked to step down, and the Enforcement Directorate instigated the investigation taking him into custody.[56] Siddaramaiah too agreed upon the illegal transactions on the floor of the house, but stated that it was \u20b989 crores and not \u20b9187 crores.[57][58] In August 2024, a social worker named T J Abraham filed a complaint to the governor against chief minister Siddaramaiah, accusing of \"misuse of power\" to influence \"Mysore Urban Development Authority (MUDA)\" to allot 14 site plots in Mysore to his wife.[59][60] This led to a wide row and the opposition parties demanded his resignation by conducting a march from Bangalore to Mysore.[61] Further on 17 August the governor Thawar Chand gehlot issued a prosecution notice against the chief minister to proceed investigations, based on these alleged irregularities.[62][63] Further Siddaramaiah lodged a petition questioning the Governor's prosecution, stating that it is unconstitutional and the governor has not applied any mental ability before issuing the notice. On 24 September the High Court of Karnataka issued it's judgement dismissing the petition, and stated that the \"Governor has the provision to use independent decisions in such exceptional cases, and has used abundant application of mind, while the case would undoubtedly require investigation since the beneficiary is the family of the petitioner Siddaramaiah\".[64][65] The very next day on 25 September, the Special Court of Representatives ordered a detailed investigation of the case filed against the chief minister and transferred it to the Karnataka Lokayukta Mysore division, with a deadline to submit the investigation report within 3 months.[66][67] The Karnataka Lokayukta has filed 61 corruption cases, out of which 11 were disposed of as of 2019. Siddaramaiah has 50 cases pending against him in the Lokayukta.[68][69]",
    "Spicy Chicken": " Chicken is the most common type of poultry in the world.[3] Owing to the relative ease and low cost of raising chickens\u2014in comparison to mammals such as cattle or hogs\u2014chicken meat (commonly called just \"chicken\") and chicken eggs have become prevalent in numerous cuisines. Chicken can be prepared in a vast range of ways, including baking, grilling, barbecuing, frying, and boiling. Since the latter half of the 20th century, prepared chicken has become a staple of fast food. Chicken is sometimes cited as being more healthful than red meat, with lower concentrations of cholesterol and saturated fat.[4] The poultry farming industry that accounts for chicken production takes on a range of forms across different parts of the world. In developed countries, chickens are typically subject to intensive farming methods while less-developed areas raise chickens using more traditional farming techniques. The United Nations estimates there to be 19 billion chickens on Earth in 2011, making them outnumber humans more than two to one.[5] The modern chicken is a descendant of red junglefowl hybrids along with the grey junglefowl first raised thousands of years ago in the northern parts of the Indian subcontinent.[6] Chicken as a meat has been depicted in Babylonian carvings from around 600 BC.[7] Chicken was one of the most common meats available in the Middle Ages.[8][9] For thousands of years, a number of different kinds of chicken have been eaten across most of the Eastern hemisphere,[10] including capons, pullets, and hens. It was one of the basic ingredients in blancmange, a stew usually consisting of chicken and fried onions cooked in milk and seasoned with spices and sugar.[11] In the United States in the 1800s, chicken was more expensive than other meats and it was \"sought by the rich because [it is] so costly as to be an uncommon dish.\"[12] Chicken consumption in the U.S. increased during World War II due to a shortage of beef and pork.[13] In Europe, consumption of chicken overtook that of beef and veal in 1996, linked to consumer awareness of bovine spongiform encephalopathy (mad cow disease).[14] 357 million tonnes of meat were produced in 2021, 53% more than in 2000, with chicken meat representing more than half the increase. Chicken meat was the most produced type of meat in 2021 just ahead of pig meat.[15] Modern varieties of chicken such as the Cornish Cross, are bred specifically for meat production, with an emphasis placed on the ratio of feed to meat produced by the animal. The most common breeds of chicken consumed in the U.S. are Cornish and White Rock.[16] Chickens raised specifically for food are called broilers. In the U.S., broilers are typically butchered at a young age. Modern Cornish Cross hybrids, for example, are butchered as early as 8 weeks for fryers and 12 weeks for roasting birds.[citation needed] Capons (castrated cocks) produce more and fattier meat. For this reason, they are considered a delicacy and were particularly popular in the Middle Ages.[citation needed] Chicken meat contains about two to three times as much polyunsaturated fat as most types of red meat when measured as weight percentage.[23] Chicken generally includes low fat in the meat itself (castrated roosters excluded).[citation needed] The fat is highly concentrated on the skin.[citation needed] 100 grams (3.5\u00a0oz) of raw chicken breast contains 2 grams (0.071\u00a0oz) of fat and 22 grams (0.78\u00a0oz) of protein, compared to 9 grams (0.32\u00a0oz) of fat and 20 grams (0.71\u00a0oz) of protein for the same portion of raw beef flank steak.[24][25] In factory farming, chickens are routinely administered with the feed additive roxarsone, an organoarsenic compound which partially decomposes into inorganic arsenic compounded in the flesh of chickens, and in their feces, which are often used as a fertilizer.[26] The compound is used to control stomach pathogens and promote growth. In a 2013 sample conducted by the Johns Hopkins School of Public Health of chicken meat from poultry producers that did not prohibit roxarsone, 70% of the samples in the US had levels which exceeded the safety limits as set by the FDA.[27] The FDA has since[dubious \u2013 discuss] revised its stance on safe limits to inorganic arsenic in animal feed by stating that \"any new animal drug that contributes to the overall inorganic arsenic burden is of potential concern\".[28] The FDA approval for roxarsone and two other arsenic poultry drugs were voluntarily withdrawn by the manufacturers in September 2013.[29] The final remaining arsenic drug nitarsone was banned at the end of 2015.[30] Information obtained by the Canadian Integrated Program for Antimicrobial Resistance (CIPARS) \"strongly indicates that cephalosporin resistance in humans is moving in lockstep with the use of the drug in poultry production\". According to the Canadian Medical Association Journal, the unapproved antibiotic ceftiofur is routinely injected into eggs in Quebec and Ontario to discourage infection of hatchlings. Although the data are contested by the industry, antibiotic resistance in humans appears to be directly related to the antibiotic's use in eggs.[31] A study by the Translational Genomics Research Institute showed that nearly half (47%) of the meat and poultry in US grocery stores was contaminated with S. aureus, with more than half (52%) of those bacteria resistant to antibiotics.[32] Furthermore, as per the FDA, more than 25% of retail chicken is resistant to 5 or more different classes of antibiotic treatment drugs in the United States.[33] An estimated 90\u2013100% of conventional chicken contains, at least, one form of antibiotic resistance microorganism, while organic chicken has been found to have a lower incidence at 84%.[34][35] In random surveys of chicken products across the United States in 2012, the Physicians Committee for Responsible Medicine found 48% of samples to contain fecal matter. On most commercial chicken farms, the chickens spend their entire life standing in, lying on, and living in their own manure, which is somewhat mixed in with the bedding material (e.g., sawdust, wood shavings, chopped straw, etc.). During shipping from the concentrated animal feeding operation farm to the abattoir, the chickens are usually placed inside shipping crates that usually have slatted floors. Those crates are then piled 5 to 10 rows high on the transport truck to the abattoir. During shipment, the chickens tend to defecate, and that chicken manure tends to sit inside the crowded cages, contaminating the feathers and skin of the chickens, or rains down upon the chickens and crates on the lower levels of the transport truck. By the time the truck gets to the abattoir, most chickens have had their skin and feathers contaminated with feces. There is also fecal matter in the intestines. While the slaughter process removes the feathers and intestines, only visible fecal matter is removed.[36] The high speed automated processes at the abattoir are not designed to remove this fecal contamination on the feather and skin. The high speed processing equipment tend to spray the contamination around to the birds going down the processing line, and the equipment on the line itself. At one or more points on most abattoirs, chemical sprays and baths (e.g., bleach, acids, peroxides, etc.) are used to partially rinse off or kill this bacterial contamination. The fecal contamination, once it has occurred, especially in the various membranes between the skin and muscle, is impossible to completely remove. Chicken is sold both as whole birds and broken down into pieces. In the United Kingdom, juvenile chickens of less than 28 days of age at slaughter are marketed as poussin. Mature chicken is sold as small, medium or large. In the United States, whole mature chickens are marketed as fryers, broilers, and roasters. Fryers are the smallest size (2.5-4\u00a0lbs dressed for sale), and the most common, as chicken reach this size quickly (about 7 weeks). Broilers are larger than fryers. Roasters, or roasting hens, are the largest chickens commonly sold (3\u20135 months and 6-8\u00a0lbs) and are typically more expensive. Even larger and older chickens are called stewing chickens but these are no longer usually found commercially. The names reflect the most appropriate cooking method for the surface area to volume ratio. As the size increases, the volume (which determines how much heat must enter the bird for it to be cooked) increases faster than the surface area (which determines how fast heat can enter the bird). For a fast method of cooking, such as frying, a small bird is appropriate: frying a large piece of chicken results in the inside being undercooked when the outside is ready. Chicken is also sold broken down into pieces. Such pieces usually come from smaller birds that would qualify as fryers if sold whole. Pieces may include quarters, or fourths of the chicken. A chicken is typically cut into two leg quarters and two breast quarters. Each quarter contains two of the commonly available pieces of chicken. A leg quarter contains the thigh, drumstick and a portion of the back; a leg has the back portion removed. A breast quarter contains the breast, wing and portion of the back; a breast has the back portion and wing removed. Pieces may be sold in packages of all of the same pieces, or in combination packages. Whole chicken cut up refers to either the entire bird cut into 8 individual pieces. (8-piece cut); or sometimes without the back. A 9-piece cut (usually for fast food restaurants) has the tip of the breast cut off before splitting. Pick of the chicken, or similar titles, refers to a package with only some of the chicken pieces, typically the breasts, thighs, and legs without wings or back. Thighs and breasts are sold boneless or skinless. Chicken livers and gizzards are commonly available packaged separately. Other parts of the chicken, such as the neck, feet, combs, etc. are not widely available except in countries where they are in demand, or in cities that cater to ethnic groups who favor these parts. Worldwide, there are many fast food restaurant chains that sell exclusively or primarily poultry products including KFC (global), Red Rooster (Australia), Hector Chicken (Belgium) and CFC (Indonesia). Most of the products on the menus in such eateries are fried or breaded and are served with french fries. Raw chicken may contain Salmonella. The safe minimum cooking temperature recommended by the U.S. Department of Health & Human Services is 165\u00a0\u00b0F (74\u00a0\u00b0C) to prevent foodborne illness because of bacteria and parasites.[37] However, in Japan raw chicken is sometimes consumed in a dish called torisashi, which is sliced raw chicken served in sashimi style. Another preparation is toriwasa which is lightly seared on the outsides while the inside remains raw.[38] Chicken can be cooked in many ways. It can be made into sausages, skewered, put in salads, traditionally grilled or by using electric grill, breaded and deep-fried, or used in various curries. There is significant variation in cooking methods amongst cultures. Historically common methods include roasting, baking, broasting, and frying. Western cuisine frequently has chicken prepared by deep frying for fast foods such as fried chicken, chicken nuggets, chicken lollipops or Buffalo wings. They are also often grilled for salads or tacos. Eastern cuisine has chicken prepared by marination, especially chicken Philippine adobo.[39] Chickens often come with labels such as \"roaster\", which suggest a method of cooking based on the type of chicken. While these labels are only suggestions, ones labeled for stew often do not do well when cooked with other methods.[40] Some chicken breast cuts and processed chicken breast products include the moniker \"with rib meat\". This is a misnomer, as it refers to the small piece of white meat that overlays the scapula, removed along with the breast meat. The breast is cut from the chicken and sold as a solid cut, while the leftover breast and true rib meat is stripped from the bone through mechanical separation for use in chicken franks, for example. Breast meat is often sliced thinly and marketed as chicken slices, an easy filling for sandwiches. Often, the tenderloin (pectoralis minor) is marketed separately from the breast (pectoralis major). In the US, \"tenders\" can be either tenderloins or strips cut from the breast. In the UK the strips of pectoralis minor are called \"chicken mini-fillets\". Chicken bones are hazardous to health as they tend to break into sharp splinters when eaten, but they can be simmered with vegetables and herbs for hours or even days to make chicken stock. In Asian countries it is possible to buy bones alone as they are very popular for making chicken soups, which are said to be healthy. In Australia the rib cages and backs of chickens after the other cuts have been removed are frequently sold cheaply in supermarket delicatessen sections as either \"chicken frames\" or \"chicken carcasses\" and are purchased for soup or stock purposes. Raw chicken maintains its quality longer than fresh in the freezer, as moisture is lost during cooking.[43] There is little change in nutrient value of chicken during freezer storage.[43] For optimal quality, however, a maximum storage time in the freezer of 12 months is recommended for uncooked whole chicken, 9 months for uncooked chicken parts, 3 to 4 months for uncooked chicken giblets, and 4 months for cooked chicken.[43] Freezing does not usually cause color changes in poultry, but the bones and the meat near them can become dark. This bone darkening results when pigment seeps through the porous bones of young poultry into the surrounding tissues when the poultry meat is frozen and thawed.[43] It is safe to freeze chicken directly in its original packaging, but this type of wrap is permeable to air and quality may diminish over time. Therefore, for prolonged storage, it is recommended to overwrap these packages.[43] It is recommended to freeze unopened vacuum packages as is.[43] If a package has accidentally been torn or has opened while food is in the freezer, the food is still safe to use, but it is still recommended to overwrap or rewrap it.[43] Chicken should be away from other foods, so if they begin to thaw, their juices will not drip onto other foods.[43] If previously frozen chicken is purchased at a retail store, it can be refrozen if it has been handled properly.[43] Bacteria survives but does not grow in freezing temperatures. However, if frozen cooked foods are not defrosted properly and are not reheated to temperatures that kill bacteria, chances of getting a foodborne illness greatly increase.[44] This article incorporates text from a free content work.

    "Stew": "A stew is a combination of solid food ingredients that have been cooked in liquid and served in the resultant gravy. Ingredients can include any combination of vegetables and may include meat, especially tougher meats suitable for slow-cooking, such as beef, pork, venison, rabbit, lamb, poultry, sausages, and seafood. While water can be used as the stew-cooking liquid, stock is also common. A small amount of red wine or other alcohol is sometimes added for flavour. Seasonings and flavourings may also be added. Stews are typically cooked at a relatively low temperature (simmered, not boiled), allowing flavours to mingle. Stewing is suitable for the least tender cuts of meat that become tender and juicy with the slow, moist heat method. This makes it popular for low-cost cooking. Cuts with a certain amount of marbling and gelatinous connective tissue give moist, juicy stews, while lean meat may easily become dry. Stews are thickened by reduction or with flour, either by coating pieces of meat with flour before searing or by using a roux or beurre mani\u00e9, a dough consisting of equal parts fat and flour. Thickeners like cornstarch, potato starch, or arrowroot may also be used. Stews have been made since ancient times. The world's oldest known evidence of stew was found in Japan, dating to the J\u014dmon period.[1][2] Amazonian tribes used the shells of turtles as vessels, boiling the entrails of the turtle and various other ingredients in them. There are recipes for lamb stews and fish stews in the Roman cookery book Apicius, believed to date from the 4th century AD. Le Viandier, one of the oldest cookbooks in French, written in the early 14th century by the French chef known as Taillevent, has ragouts or stews of various types in it.[3] The first written reference to 'Irish stew' is in Byron's \"The Devil's Drive\" (1814): \"The Devil\u00a0... dined on\u00a0... a rebel or so in an Irish stew.\"[4] Meat-based white stews also known as blanquettes or fricass\u00e9es are made with lamb or veal that is blanched or lightly seared without browning, and cooked in stock. Brown stews are made with pieces of red meat that are first seared or browned, before a browned mirepoix and sometimes browned flour, stock and wine are added.",
    "Strawberry": " The garden strawberry (or simply strawberry; Fragaria \u00d7 ananassa)[1] is a widely grown hybrid species of the genus Fragaria in the rose family, Rosaceae, collectively known as the strawberries, which are cultivated worldwide for their fruit. The fruit is widely appreciated for its characteristic aroma, bright red color, juicy texture, and sweetness. It is consumed in large quantities, either fresh or in such prepared foods as jam, juice, pies, ice cream, milkshakes, and chocolates. Artificial strawberry flavorings and aromas are also widely used in products such as confectionery, soap, lip gloss, perfume, and many others. The garden strawberry was first bred in Brittany, France, in the 1750s via a cross of Fragaria virginiana from eastern North America and Fragaria chiloensis, which was brought from Chile by Am\u00e9d\u00e9e-Fran\u00e7ois Fr\u00e9zier in 1714.[2] Cultivars of Fragaria \u00d7 ananassa have replaced, in commercial production, the woodland strawberry (Fragaria vesca), which was the first strawberry species cultivated in the early 17th century.[3] From a botanical point of view, the strawberry is not a berry but an aggregate accessory fruit, meaning that the fleshy part is derived not from the plant's ovaries but from the receptacle that holds the ovaries.[4] Each apparent \"seed\" (achene) on the outside of the fruit is actually one of the ovaries of the flower, with a seed inside it.[4] In 2019, world production of strawberries was nine million tons, led by China with 40% of the total. The first garden strawberry was grown in Brittany, France, during the late 18th century.[3] Prior to this, wild strawberries and cultivated selections from wild strawberry species were the common source of the fruit. The strawberry fruit was mentioned in ancient Roman literature in reference to its medicinal use. The French began taking the strawberry from the forest to their gardens for harvest in the 14th century. Charles V of France (r.\u20091364\u20131380) had 1,200 strawberry plants in his royal garden. In the early 15th century western European monks were using the wild strawberry in their illuminated manuscripts. The strawberry is found in Italian, Flemish, and German art, and in English miniatures.[5] The entire strawberry plant was used to treat depressive illnesses. By the 16th century, references of cultivation of the strawberry became more common. People began using it for its supposed medicinal properties and botanists began naming the different species. In England the demand for regular strawberry farming had increased by the mid-16th century. The combination of strawberries and cream was created by Thomas Wolsey in the court of King Henry VIII.[6] Instructions for growing and harvesting strawberries showed up in writing in 1578. By the end of the 16th century three European species had been cited: F. vesca, F. moschata, and F. viridis. The garden strawberry was transplanted from the forests and then the plants would be propagated asexually by cutting off the runners. Two subspecies of F. vesca were identified: F. sylvestris alba and F. sylvestris semperflorens. The introduction of F. virginiana from eastern North America to Europe in the 17th century is an important part of history because it is one of the two species that gave rise to the modern strawberry. The new species gradually spread through the continent and did not become completely appreciated until the end of the 18th century. A French excursion journeyed to Chile in 1712, which led to the introduction of a strawberry plant with female flowers that resulted in the common strawberry. The Mapuche and Huilliche Indians of Chile cultivated the female strawberry species until 1551, when the Spanish came to conquer the land. In 1765, a European explorer recorded the cultivation of F. chiloensis, the Chilean strawberry. At first introduction to Europe, the plants grew vigorously, but produced no fruit.  French gardeners in Brest and Cherbourg around the mid-18th century first noticed that when F. moschata and F. virginiana were planted in between rows of F. chiloensis, the Chilean strawberry would bear abundant and unusually large fruits. Soon after, Antoine Nicolas Duchesne began to study the breeding of strawberries and made several discoveries crucial to the science of plant breeding, such as the sexual reproduction of the strawberry which he published in 1766. Duchesne discovered that the female F. chiloensis plants could only be pollinated by male F. moschata or F. virginiana plants.[7] This is when the Europeans became aware that plants had the ability to produce male-only or female-only flowers. Duchesne determined F. ananassa to be a hybrid of F. chiloensis and F. virginiana. F. ananassa, which produces large fruits, is so named because it resembles the pineapple in smell, taste and berry shape. In England, many varieties of F. ananassa were produced, and they form the basis of modern varieties of strawberries currently cultivated and consumed. Further breeding was also conducted in Europe and America to improve the hardiness, disease resistance, size, and taste.[7] During the Green Revolution of the 1950s, agronomists used selective breeding to expand phenotypic diversity of the garden strawberry. Adoption of perpetual flowering hybrids not sensitive to changes in photoperiod gave higher yields and expansion of production in California.[8] Raw strawberries are 91% water, 8% carbohydrates, 1% protein, and contain negligible fat (table). A 100 grams (3.5\u00a0oz) reference amount of strawberries supplies 33 kilocalories, is a rich source of vitamin C (71% of the Daily Value, DV), a good source of manganese (18% DV), and provides several other vitamins and dietary minerals in small amounts. Strawberries contain a modest amount of essential unsaturated fatty acids in the achene (seed) oil.[11] Garden strawberries contain a number of phytochemicals, including the dimeric ellagitannin agrimoniin which is an isomer of sanguiin H-6.[12][13] Other polyphenols present include flavonoids, such as anthocyanins, flavanols, flavonols and phenolic acids, such as hydroxybenzoic acid and hydroxycinnamic acid.[11] Strawberries contain fisetin and possess higher levels of this flavonoid than other fruits.[13][14] Although achenes comprise only about 1% of total fresh weight of a strawberry, they contribute 11% of the total polyphenol in the whole fruit; achene phytochemicals include ellagic acid, ellagic acid glycosides, and ellagitannins.[15] Pelargonidin-3-glucoside is the major anthocyanin in strawberries and cyanidin-3-glucoside is found in smaller proportions. Although glucose seems to be the most common substituting sugar in strawberry anthocyanins, rutinose, arabinose, and rhamnose conjugates have been found in some strawberry cultivars.[11] Purple minor pigments consisting of dimeric anthocyanins (flavanol-anthocyanin adducts: catechin(4\u03b1\u21928)pelargonidin 3-O-\u03b2-glucopyranoside, epicatechin(4\u03b1\u21928)pelargonidin 3-O-\u03b2-glucopyranoside, afzelechin(4\u03b1\u21928)pelargonidin 3-O-\u03b2-glucopyranoside and epiafzelechin(4\u03b1\u21928)pelargonidin 3-O-\u03b2-glucopyranoside) can also be found in strawberries.[16] Sweetness, fragrance and complex flavor are favorable attributes.[17] In plant breeding and farming, emphasis is placed on sugars, acids, and volatile compounds, which improve the taste and fragrance of a ripe strawberry.[18] Although often sweet tasting, strawberries actually have relatively low sugar levels compared to other fruits. Esters, terpenes, and furans are the chemical compounds having the strongest relationships to strawberry flavor, sweetness and fragrance, with a total of 31 out of some 360 volatile compounds significantly correlated to favorable flavor and fragrance.[18][19][20] In breeding strawberries for the commercial market in the United States, the volatile compounds, methyl anthranilate and gamma-decalactone prominent in aromatic wild strawberries, are especially desired for their \"sweet and fruity\" aroma characteristics.[19][20] As strawberry flavor and fragrance are characteristics that may appeal to consumers,[19][20][21] they are used widely in a variety of manufacturing, including foods, beverages, confections, perfumes and cosmetics.[22][23] Modern strawberries are octoploid (8 sets of chromosomes).[24] The genome sequence of the garden strawberry was published in 2019.[25] Some people experience an anaphylactoid reaction to eating strawberries.[26] The most common form of this reaction is oral allergy syndrome, but symptoms may also mimic hay fever or include dermatitis or hives, and, in severe cases, may cause breathing problems.[27] Proteomic studies indicate that the allergen may be tied to a protein for the red anthocyanin biosynthesis expressed in strawberry ripening, named Fra a1 (Fragaria allergen1).[28] Homologous proteins are found in birch pollen and apple, suggesting that people may develop cross-reactivity to all three species. White-fruited strawberry cultivars, lacking Fra a1, may be an option for strawberry allergy sufferers. Since they lack a protein necessary for normal ripening by anthocyanin synthesis of red pigments, the mature berries do not turn red like other cultivars.[28] They ripen but remain white, pale yellow or \"golden\", appearing like immature berries; this also has the advantage of making them less attractive to birds. A virtually allergen-free cultivar named 'Sofar' is available.[29][30] Strawberries are often grouped according to their flowering habit.[31][32] Traditionally, this has consisted of a division between \"June-bearing\" strawberries, which bear their fruit in the early summer and \"ever-bearing\" strawberries, which often bear several crops of fruit throughout the season.[32] One plant throughout a season may produce 50 to 60 times or roughly once every three days.[33] Strawberries occur in three basic flowering habits: short-day, long-day, and day-neutral. These describe the day-length sensitivity of the plant and the type of photoperiod that induces flower formation. Day-neutral cultivars produce flowers regardless of the photoperiod.[34] Strawberry cultivars vary widely in size, color, flavor, shape, degree of fertility, season of ripening, liability to disease and constitution of plant.[31] On average, a strawberry has about 200 seeds on its external membrane.[35] Some vary in foliage, while others vary materially in the development of their sexual organs. In most cases, the flowers appear hermaphroditic in structure, but function as either male or female.[36] In addition to being consumed fresh, strawberries can be frozen or made into jam or preserves,[37] as well as dried and used in prepared foods, such as cereal bars.[38] Strawberries and strawberry flavorings are a popular addition to dairy products, such as strawberry milk, strawberry ice cream, strawberry milkshakes/smoothies and strawberry yogurts.[citation needed] In the United Kingdom, \"strawberries and cream\" is a popular dessert consumed at the Wimbledon tennis tournament.[6] Strawberries and cream is also a staple snack in Mexico, usually available at ice cream parlors. In Sweden, strawberries are a traditional dessert served on Midsummer's Eve. Depending on area, strawberry pie, strawberry rhubarb pie, or strawberry shortcake are also common. In Greece, strawberries may be sprinkled with sugar and then dipped in Metaxa, a brandy, and served as a dessert. In Italy, strawberries are used for various desserts and as a common flavoring for gelato (gelato alla fragola).[citation needed] Fresh strawberries are used as cocktail garnishes to add flavor and texture to a drink. Polyphenol extracted from strawberries have been used in Kanazawa, Japan, to create melting-resistant popsicles.[39] In 2022, world production of strawberries was 9.6\u00a0million tonnes, led by China with 35% of the total and the United States and Turkey as other significant producers (table). Due to the relatively fragile nature of the strawberry, approximately 35 percent of the $2.2\u00a0billion United States crop was spoiled in 2020. This led to an Idaho company planning to launch gene-edited strawberries in the near future in an effort to make them more durable. In the U.S., as of 2021[update], it cost growers around $35,000 per acre to plant and $35,000 per acre to harvest strawberries, with more durable berries potentially reducing the rate of spoilage.[41] For purposes of commercial production, plants are propagated from runners and, in general, distributed as either bare root plants or plugs. Cultivation follows one of two general models\u2014annual plasticulture,[42] or a perennial system of matted rows or mounds.[43] Greenhouses produce a small amount of strawberries during the off season.[44] The bulk of modern commercial production uses the plasticulture system. In this method, raised beds are formed each year, fumigated, and covered with plastic to prevent weed growth and erosion. Plants, usually obtained from northern nurseries, are planted through holes punched in this covering, and irrigation tubing is run underneath. Runners are removed from the plants as they appear, to encourage the plants to put most of their energy into fruit development. After harvesting, the plastic is removed and the plants are plowed into the ground.[42][45] Strawberry plants produce more and better fruit when they are young. After a year or two, they decline. Replacing them annually improves yields and enables denser planting.[42][45] However, this necessitates a longer growing season, for the plants to establish themselves.  It also costs more to annually purchase plants, form new mounds, and cover them with (new) plastic.[45] The other major method retains plants for multiple years. This is most common in colder climates. The plants are grown in rows or on mounds.[42][43] This method requires lower investment and lower maintenance, overall.[43] Yields are typically lower than in plasticulture.[43] Another method uses a compost sock. Plants grown in compost socks have been shown to produce significantly more flavonoids, anthocyanins, fructose, glucose, sucrose, malic acid, and citric acid than fruit produced in the black plastic mulch or matted row systems.[46] Similar results in an earlier study conducted by USDA confirms how compost plays a role in the bioactive qualities of two strawberry cultivars.[47] Strawberries may also be propagated by seed, though this is primarily a hobby activity, and is not widely practiced commercially. A few seed-propagated cultivars have been developed for home use, and research into growing from seed commercially is ongoing.[48] Seeds (achenes) are acquired either via commercial seed suppliers, or by collecting and saving them from the fruit. Strawberries can also be grown indoors in strawberry pots.[49] Strawberries will not grow indoors in winter unless aided by a combination of blue and red LED lights.[50] In Florida, winter is the natural growing season and harvesting begins in mid-November.[33] The Kashubian strawberry (Truskawka kaszubska or Kasz\u00ebbsk\u00f4 mal\u00ebna)[51] is the first Polish fruit to be given commercial protection under EU law. It is produced in Kartuzy, Ko\u015bcierzyna and Byt\u00f3w counties and in the municipalities of Przywidz, Wejherowo, Luzino, Szemud, Linia, \u0141\u0119czyce and Cewice in Kashubia. Only the following varieties may be sold as kasz\u00ebbsk\u00f4 mal\u00ebna: Senga Sengana, Elsanta, Honeoye that have been graded as Extra or Class I.[citation needed] Most strawberry plants are now fed with artificial fertilizers, both before and after harvesting, and often before planting in plasticulture.[52] To maintain top quality, berries are harvested at least every other day. The berries are picked with the caps still attached and with at least half an inch of stem left. Strawberries need to remain on the plant to fully ripen because they do not continue to ripen after being picked. Rotted and overripe berries are removed to minimize insect and disease problems. The berries do not get washed until just before consumption.[53] Soil test information and plant analysis results are used to determine fertility practices. Nitrogen fertilizer is needed at the beginning of every planting year. There are normally adequate levels of phosphorus and potash when fields have been fertilized for top yields. To provide more organic matter, a cover crop of wheat or rye is planted in the winter before planting the strawberries. Strawberries prefer a pH from 5.5 to 6.5, so lime is usually not applied.[54] The harvesting and cleaning process has not changed substantially over time. As they are delicate, strawberries are still harvested by hand.[55] Grading and packing often occurs in the field, rather than in a processing facility.[55] In large operations, strawberries are cleaned by means of water streams and shaking conveyor belts. Strawberries are popular in home gardens, and numerous cultivars have been selected for consumption and for exhibition purposes.[56] The following cultivars have gained the Royal Horticultural Society's Award of Garden Merit: In the United States in 2017, the collective commercial production of strawberries, blueberries, raspberries, and blackberries was a $6\u00a0billion industry dominated by the California growing and marketing company Driscoll's.[19] In 2017, strawberries alone were a $3.5\u00a0billion market of which 82% was for fresh fruit.[63] To increase consumer demand in the 21st century, commercial producers of strawberries cultivated them mainly for favorable aroma characteristics similar to those of wild strawberries,[20] in addition to having large size, heart-shape, glossy red exterior, firmness, and slow ripening for long shelf-life favorable to ship by ground transportation from farms to stores nationwide for consumption within two weeks of harvest.[19] In US and Canadian grocery stores, fresh strawberries are typically sold in plastic clamshells, and are among the top fresh produce items in grocery revenues.[19] One marketing analysis identified strawberries and other berries as a source of \"happiness\" for consumers.[19] Around 200 species of pests are known to attack strawberries both directly and indirectly.[64] These pests include slugs, moths, fruit flies, chafers, strawberry root weevils, strawberry thrips, strawberry sap beetles, strawberry crown moth, mites, aphids, and others.[64][65] The caterpillars of a number of species of Lepidoptera feed on strawberry plants. For example, the ghost moth is known to be a pest of the strawberry plant. The strawberry aphid, Chaetosiphon fragaefolii, is a bug species found in the United States (Arizona), Argentina and Chile. It is a vector of the strawberry mild yellow-edge virus. The amounts of pesticides required for industrial production of strawberries (300 pounds (140\u00a0kg) in California per acre) have led to the strawberry leading the list of EWG's \"Dirty Dozen\" of pesticide-contaminated produce.[66] Strawberry plants can fall victim to a number of diseases, especially when subjected to stress.[67][68] The leaves may be infected by powdery mildew, leaf spot (caused by the fungus Sphaerella fragariae), leaf blight (caused by the fungus Phomopsis obscurans), and by a variety of slime molds.[67] The crown and roots may fall victim to red stele, verticillium wilt, black root rot, and nematodes.[67] The fruits are subject to damage from gray mold (Botrytis cinerea), rhizopus rot, and leather rot.[67] To prevent root-rotting, strawberries should be planted every four to five years in a new bed, at a different site.[69] The NPR1 gene from Arabidopsis thaliana, AtNPR1, confers A. thaliana's broad-spectrum resistance when transexpressed in F. ananassa.[70] This resistance includes resistance to anthracnose, powdery mildew, and angular leaf spot.[70] A 1997 study assessed many wound volatiles and found all effective against gray mold (B. cinerea).[71] Both Tribute and Chandler were tested and benefited from the treatments, although there are large differences between the substance x variety effects.[71] Strawberry metabolizes these volatiles, and does so more rapidly than either blackberry or grape.[71] The plants can also develop disease from temperature extremes during winter.[67] Watering strawberry roots, and not the leaves, is preferred as moisture on leaves encourages fungal growth.[72] Strawberries may also often appear conjoined together or deformed due to poor pollination.[73]",
    "Stuffed Bell Peppers": "Stuffed peppers is a dish common in many cuisines. It consists of hollowed or halved bell peppers filled with any of a variety of fillings, often including meat, vegetables, cheese, rice, or sauce. The dish is usually assembled by filling the cavities of the peppers and then cooking. The Cantonese version of stuffed peppers is part of a street food called Three Fried Stuffed Treasures (\u714e\u91c0\u4e09\u5bf6), with stuffed peppers, stuffed aubergines, and stuffed sausage. Though with different vegetables and meat, the stuffing is all the same: dace fish paste. After assembling the fish paste, it is deep-fried. It is usually served with Worcestershire sauce, or can be served without sauce.[1][2] Stuffed peppers or pimientos rellenos are part of traditional Spanish cuisine, especially that of the region of the Basque Country. Usually piquillo peppers are used.[3] The fillings might include Manchego cheese, chicken, or cod in a red sauce, with chicken likely being the most popular recipe. Stuffed peppers or peperoni ripieni are part of the Italian gastronomic tradition, especially in the southern regions and particularly in Calabria. The traditional Calabrian recipe, called pipi chini, involves the use of round bell peppers, and the filling is made with breadcrumbs, parsley, basil, Grana cheese, tomato, and provola cheese. Sometimes hard-boiled egg, anchovies or ground meat are also added.[4] Stuffed peppers (bharvan mirch or bharva hari mirch) is one of several stuffed vegetable (bharvan subji) dishes.[5] It consists of bell peppers stuffed with cooked meat, potatoes, and onions and seasoned with chili, turmeric, coriander, cilantro, salt, and lemon juice. The peppers are then either browned in a tava (frying pan) or baked in an oven until the peppers are scorched. Mirchi bajji or pakora is a chaat (street food) item and is a hot favorite during the monsoon and cooler months. In  Mumbai and western areas, the big green chilli pepper is stuffed with a roasted, spiced flour mix and fried. In the South, the big green chillies, similar to Hatch chili peppers, are dipped in a flour batter and fried. It may be accompanied by chutneys and sauces. In Andhra Pradesh and Tamil Nadu, some of the smaller but more potent chillies are also stuffed and fried, especially as a side to rice. Dolma is a family of stuffed dishes from Ottoman cuisine that can be served warm or cold. Some types of dolma are made with whole vegetables including whole peppers. Today, dolma are found in the cuisines of the Balkans, South Caucasus, Central Asia and the Levant, and the family cuisines of Sephardic and Iraqi Jews. Dolma dishes are found in Balkan, Caucasian, Arab, Israeli, Turkish, and Central Asian cuisine, and were historically part of the Ottoman palace cuisine. The word dolma, of Turkish origin, means \"something stuffed\".[6][7] Stuffed peppers in American cuisine is a dish where bell peppers (often the green, yellow, orange, and red varieties) are typically filled with a stuffing such as ground beef, mixed with bread crumbs or cooked rice, eggs, herbs, and spices (especially paprika and parsley) and cheese.[8] Recipes vary but often include hollowing out the peppers, stuffing them, covering them with cheese, and baking or alternatively cooking them on the stove top at a slow simmer in canned tomato sauce until the peppers are soft. A sauce may be served with them, often a tomato sauce, but this, too, varies greatly.[9][10] Mexican and \u201cTex-Mex\u201d cuisine has more than one stuffed pepper dish: In Guatemala, the \"pimiento\" pepper is stuffed with shredded pork and vegetables.  As the Mexican version, it is covered with egg batter and fried.  It is served with tomato sauce or inside a bread bun. There are many names for stuffed peppers in the languages of Central and Southeast Europe: The Hungarian variant, t\u00f6lt\u00f6tt paprika, is always made with Hungarian wax pepper, which has a distinctive taste somewhat similar to lecs\u00f3. Punjena paprika (pronounced [p\u00fb\u0272ena\u02d0 p\u01ceprika]) includes a tomato sauce. In Bulgaria, stuffed peppers are usually eaten with yogurt. Another variety of stuffed peppers in Bulgaria is made with mixed white cheese and eggs instead of meat and rice as stuffing.[citation needed] In 2017, dolma making in Azerbaijan was included in the UNESCO Intangible Cultural Heritage Lists.[12] In Romanian cuisine, stuffed peppers are usually prepared with bell peppers stuffed with ground meat (usually pork), rice, onion, and other vegetables and spices and then boiled in a sauce made from cream, tomatoes, and spices.[citation needed] Traditionally in Bulgaria, the filling is made of rice steamed in advance, onions, minced meat and spices, heat-treated and crammed into pre-cleaned, washed and riddled with needle peppers. After filling of peppers, they are put in a baking dish, water is added and the dish is baked in the oven. If raw egg is added to the cooled stuffing, filled peppers can be cooked in a pan, as the pods are boiled almost steamed. Besides minced meat and rice, other fillings may be used, such as vegetables (for example leek) and rice, beans, or fresh cheese and eggs. The peppers themselves can be either fresh or dried. Dried red peppers are used especially in southeastern Serbia around Pirot and Dimitrovgrad, often in winter. Stuffed peppers are often cooked by Romani people and is a popular dish in Romani cuisine.[13]",
    "Sundal": "Sundal or Sunndal is the largest village in the Mauranger district of Kvinnherad municipality in Vestland county, Norway.  The village is located on the southern shore of the Maurangsfjorden, south of Nordrepollen and Gjetingsdalen.  The village of Austrepollen lies to the east of Sunndal.  It sits in a deep valley, with steep mountains surrounding it on three sides.  The Bondhusbreen glacier is located at the southern end of the valley.[2] The village has been a centre of tourism for over 150 years. There are about 70 inhabitants in the village, which has a camping ground, a shop, and an inn.  At the end of the 19th century, German and English tourists travelled to Sundal to experience the great nature including the nearby Folgefonna glacier, and the small Bondhusbreen arm which reaches into the valley towards Sundal.  Today, the nearby Folgefonna National Park is a major draw to the area which is popular among outdoor enthusiasts.   This Vestland location article is a stub.

    "Tandoori Chicken": " Tandoori chicken is a dish made from chicken marinated in yogurt and spices and roasted in a tandoor, a cylindrical clay oven. The dish is now popular worldwide. The modern form of the dish was popularized by the Moti Mahal restaurant in New Delhi, India in the late 1940s. Chicken roasted in tandoor-like ovens is documented in the Harappan civilization of the Bronze Age of Indian subcontinent, as early as 3000 BC.[13][14][15][16][17][18] Much later, the Sushruta Samhita records meat being cooked in an oven (kandu) after being seasoned with black mustard (rai) powder and fragrant spices. Tandoori chicken as a dish originated in the Punjab before the independence of partition of India.[19][20] In the late 1940s, tandoori chicken was popularised at Moti Mahal in the locality of Daryaganj[21][22] in New Delhi by Kundan Lal Jaggi, Kundan Lal Gujral and Thakur Das Magu, who were Punjabi Hindu migrants from Peshawar[10][23][24][25][26] as well as the founders of the Moti Mahal restaurant.[1][2][3][4][25] They used to work at a small eatery called Moti Mahal, owned by a man named Mokha Singh Lamba in Peshawar, British India, from the 1920s to 1947.[5][6][27] Tandoori chicken was popularized in post-independence India by Moti Mahal, Daryaganj in Delhi[28][29] when it was served to the first Prime Minister of India, Jawaharlal Nehru.[30] There, tandoori chicken became a standard offering at official banquets.[30] In the United States, tandoori chicken began appearing on menus by the 1960s. Jacqueline Kennedy was reported to have eaten \"chicken tandoori\" on a flight from Rome to Bombay in 1962.[31] A recipe for tandoori chicken was printed in the Los Angeles Times in 1963, for \"the hostess in search of a fresh idea for a party dinner\";[32] a similar recipe was featured in the same newspaper in 1964.[33] Raw chicken parts are skinned then marinated in a mixture of dahi (yogurt) and tandoori masala, a spice blend. They are seasoned and colored with cayenne pepper, red chili powder, or Kashmiri red chili powder as well as turmeric or food coloring.[a] The marinated chicken is placed on skewers and cooked at high temperatures in a tandoor oven, which is heated with charcoal or wood, which adds to the smoky flavour. The dish can also be cooked in a standard oven, using a spit or rotisserie, or over hot charcoal.[34] There are also tandoori recipes for whole chicken, some of which are cooked in a tandoor and others over charcoal. These include Chirga (Roasted whole chicken); Tandoori Murgh (Roast whole chicken with almonds); Murgh Kabab Seekhi (Whole stuffed chicken on the spit); Kookarh Tandoori (Steamed chicken on spit); Tandoori Murgh Massaledarh (Whole spiced chicken on spit); and Murghi Bhogar (Chicken in the Bhogar style).[35] Tandoori chicken can be eaten as a starter or appetizer, or as a main course, often served with naan flatbread.[36] It is also used as the base of numerous cream-based curries, such as butter chicken.[37] The fame of tandoori chicken led to many derivatives, such as chicken tikka (and eventually the Indian dish popularized in Britain, chicken tikka masala), commonly found in menus in Indian restaurants all over the world.[38] Nearly all derivatives of tandoori chicken begin with a yogurt and citrus-based marinade.[39][40]",
    "Tandoori Masala": " Tandoori masala or tandoori sauce is a mixture of spices specifically for use with a tandoor, or clay oven, in traditional cooking in the Indian subcontinent. The specific spices vary somewhat from one region to another but typically include: garam masala, garlic, ginger, onion, cayenne pepper, and sometimes other spices and additives. The spices are often ground together with a pestle and mortar. Kundan Lal Gujral revolutionized tandoori cooking, and the creation of the tandoori masala spice blend is attributed to him. Like many spices, there is also the influence of a colonial legacy present within the rise of tandoori masala as Kundan Lal was a Hindu Punjabi living in West Punjab, before the Partition of India, who ended up moving to Delhi, India in a time where communal violence rose after the Partition of India in 1947. While working in a restaurant in Peshawar in the 1920s, Kundan Lal experimented with the tandoor that was traditionally used for baking naan. In a stroke of genius, he was the first to cook chicken in the tandoor, and the spice blend he made and used for cooking the chicken in this manner became known as tandoori masala. In Delhi, Kundan Lal opened a restaurant called Moti Mahal, which is where dishes he created using tandoori masala reached national fame with politicians such as Jawaharlal Nehru favoring the taste and global fame as the restaurant became a global chain. Indian restaurants around the world pay homage to tandoori masala in their menus as tandoori chicken and butter chicken are highly popular staple features. [1] Tandoori masala is used extensively with dishes such as tandoori chicken. In this dish, the chicken is covered with a mixture of plain yogurt and tandoori masala. The chicken is then roasted in the tandoor on high heat; when prepared in this fashion the chicken has a pink-colored exterior and a savory flavor. Other chicken dishes, in addition to tandoori chicken, use this masala, such as tikka or butter chicken, most of them Punjabi dishes. Meat other than chicken can be used, as can paneer (paneer tikka). If freshly prepared, the masala can be stored in airtight jars for up to two months. The spice blend is also readily available at larger supermarkets and specialty Asian stores, with varying tastes depending on the brand.  This Indian cuisine\u2013related article is a stub.

    "Thandai": "Thandai is a South Asian cold drink prepared with a mixture of almonds, fennel seeds, watermelon kernels, rose petals, pepper, poppy seeds, cardamom, saffron, milk and sugar. It is native to Indian Subcontinent. It is mainly used in summer. In Sikhism, it is often associated with the and Holi or Holla mahalla  festival. It is most commonly consumed in hot areas of North India Punjab and Pakistan (Southern Punjab, Sindh, and Balochistan). There are variants of thandai and the most common are badam (almond) thandai and bhang (cannabis) thandai. Thandai is a centerpiece of Holi celebrations where other snacks like dahi vada, gujiya and other savory snacks called chaat are served alongside the cold, sweet beverage.[1] Though thandai refers to a traditional festival drink made with various spices and nuts, this versatile drink can also be prepared in many different ways. Chilled or sometimes hot",
    "Thekua": " Nepal Thekua (also spelt as Thokwa or Thekariis), also known as Khajuria, Tikari[1] and Thokni, is an Indo-Nepalese cookie popular in Southern Nepal and the Indian states of Bihar and Uttar Pradesh.[2] Thekua is a revered prasada, offering to god, during Chhath puja.[3][4][5] It has been used as a sweet snack for centuries in these places.[6][7] It is widely and popularly used as a 'Sandesh' in local ancient-traditional culture. 'Sandesh' (it may be fruits, sweets or any edible/potable goods) . A 'Sandesh' is something which a guest brings to someone's home when he/she arrives there. The main ingredients of thekua are wheat flour, chasni (melted sugar) and ghee. Jaggery can sometimes be used as an alternative to sugar.[6] Dough is prepared using these four main ingredients and cardamom can be added to enhance the taste. A special wooden cookie mold is used to form various designs on the thekua.[8] Dough is deep fried in ghee or vegetable oil until it becomes reddish brown. It is soft when hot but hardens after it cools. It needs no preservatives and it can be preserved for several days for eating. The preparation of thekua for the Chhath celebration is usually done in the worshipping room, to maintain the purity.[9] A group of 16 people from Darbhanga, Bihar prepared a Thekuwa of 91\u00a0kg in 2019 to catch the attention of the Limca Book of Records.[10]  This Bihar-related article is a stub.

    "Til Pitha": " Jolpan (Assamese: \u099c\u09b2\u09aa\u09be\u09a8), or snacks, are often served at breakfast in the cuisine of Assam, although they may also be served at Bihu festivals or weddings.[1] The word jolpan includes all the preparations namely jolpan, pitha, laru and tea. Other common items served for breakfast may include roti, luchi, ghugni and sometimes paratha etc. Jolpan are also found in Bengal. The word literally derives from \"water and betel leaf\" but can mean any snack.[2] Variations on jolpan include Bora saul, Komal Saul, Xandoh, Chira, Muri, Akhoi along with curd, jaggery, yogurt and various Pitha. Bora saul (Assamese: \u09ac\u09f0\u09be \u099a\u09be\u0989\u09b2) is boiled and served as Jolpan with curd or milk, jaggery or sugar. Mostly used in Northern Assam. Kumol saul (Assamese: \u0995\u09cb\u09ae\u09b2 \u099a\u09be\u0989\u09b2) is a unique type of rice from Assam that can be eaten without cooking. It is rendered fluffy and edible by being soaked in water for a short time. The rice may be eaten with milk or curd, jaggery, yogurt after being immersed in warm water for just fifteen minutes or so. Chira (Flattened rice, also called beaten rice, Assamese: \u099a\u09bf\u09f0\u09be) is a dehusked rice which is flattened into flat light dry flakes. These flakes of rice swell when added to liquid, whether hot or cold, as they absorb water, milk or any other liquids. It can be eaten raw by immersing it in plain water or milk or curd, with salt or sugar or jaggery to taste, or lightly fried in oil. Muri (puffed rice) is made by heating sand in a pot, and then throwing in grains of rice. The rice may be washed in brine to provide seasoning. The rice puffs up and is separated from the sand by a strainer. It is served with hot milk or curd and jaggery or sugar. (Assamese: \u09b8\u09be\u09a8\u09cd\u09a6\u09b9 \u0997\u09c1\u09f0\u09bf) It is prepared from Kola bora, Ghiu bora, Pakhi bora or Ronga bora (varieties of Bora saul). The rice is soaked for three to four days and then it is fried. The fried rice is pounded in a dheki, a homemade wooden mill in Assam to pound grains, and sifted to dehusk. Now the pounded and dehusked rice is again fried in hot sand and thus Hurum is prepared. It is served with curd, hot milk, yogurt, sugar or jaggery. Dehusked Aroi bora saul is soaked for 2/3 hours. Then it is put in an immature bamboo tube and a little water or sometimes coconut milk is added to it. Banana leaf is used as cork. The tube is roasted in fire and Sunga saul is prepared. Removing the tube the substance is served with curd, hot milk, yogurt, sugar etc. Rice flour (Pithaguri in Assamese) is fried and served with hot milk, jaggery and sometimes with ripe banana or ripe jackfruit. It is a common type of jolpan. Suji (Semolina) is also one type of common jolpan, a type of dessert. Like pithaguri it is heated on a frying pan and water is added to make it a paste and then served with hot milk. The basic preparation consists of washing the millet (Konidhan in Assamese; Koni = tiny; dhan = rice) and toasting it while moving it until one notes a characteristic scent. Then five measures of boiling water for each two measures of millet are added with some sugar or salt. The mixture is cooked covered using low flame for 30\u201335 minutes. Yam (Kath aloo in Assamese) is peeled, sliced, added salt and tamarind powder and then deep fried in mustard oil. Pitha (Assamese \u09aa\u09bf\u09a0\u09be) is a rice cake or pancake, a thin-flat cake prepared from a batter and cooked on a hot griddle or frying pan. It is an inseparable part of Jolpan in Assam. It is a special class of rice preparation generally made only on special occasions like Bihu in Assam. Made usually with soaked and ground rice, they could be fried in oil, roasted over a slow fire or baked and rolled over a hot plate. Some pithas are- Til Pitha, Narikol Pitha, Ghila Pitha, Xutuli Pitha, Sunga Pitha, Bhapotdiya Pitha, Lakhimi Pitha, Tora Pitha, Tekeli Pitha, Muthiya Pitha or Kholasapori Pitha. Kachi Pitha is a type of pancake. It is a special class of rice preparation and generally made only on special occasions like Bihu in Assam. Bora saul, a glutinous type of rice is soaked and ground. Then a certain quantity of this rice flour is baked, filled up with sesame seeds, ground coconut and dried rind of orange, jaggery  etc. and pressed and rolled with many folders. Ghila pitha is a type of pancake so called because of its knee cap-sized shape. The knee cap is called Ghila in Assamese. Rice flour of Bora saul, one kind of glutinous rice or any common rice is used in it. A paste made of rice flour and jaggery is prepared first and then fried in cooking oil at a certain quantity. Salt is also used instead of jaggery to make salty Ghila pitha. It is generally prepared and served in Bihu in Assam. The procedure of preparing Sunga Pitha is almost the same as for Sunga Saul except for the fact that the preparation of sunga pitha involves grounded rice or rice flour instead of whole rice as in Sunga saul . Rice flour of Xaali saul and Bora saul is mixed with water and jaggery and churned thoroughly. Then the paste is put in an immature bamboo tube corked with banana leaf and roasted over a fire. The bamboo tube is removed to leave a solid cylinder of pitha. This is cut into pieces and served with hot milk. Rice flour of xaali saul and bora saul is mixed with jaggery or salt and water and churned thoroughly. The paste is rolled into small balls and flattened and then boiled in water. It is served with tea and also can be eaten with milk. Rice flour of Xaali saul (sunned rice) and Bora saul is mixed with coconut, sugar and a little powdered milk. Ground cardamom and dried orange rind can also be added. An earthenware, half filled up with water is set on a hearth. A neat cloth is placed on the beam of the pitcher and the flour mixture is put in it. Now the beam is covered with a cork and fire is set in the hearth. The substance is baked with the heat of vapor that comes from inside the pitcher and subsequently takes shape. Now it is cut into pieces like a cake and served with tea. This pitha is so called because a tekeli (earthenware) is used in it. The method of preparation as well as the substance is as same as tekeli pitha, but a kettle is used here instead of the earthenware. That\u2019s the reason it is called Ketli pitha (Ketli in Assamese means kettle). Here the kettle-cork is kept upside down on the kettle and the substance is put on it. It usually takes less time to be baked than tekeli pitha takes. Different types of larus are prepared in the season of Bihu in Assam. Mature coconut is scrapped (or ground) and fried. Then sugar is added and mixed well. Then it is toasted over slow fire till the ingredients caramelize and hold on to each other. Its readiness is tested by trying to make a small ball first; if it does, then the caramelized coconut pot is taken out to cool off a little. With the help of cold water rubbed on palms, and before it cools down to room temperature, it is now rolled into small balls and kept separately to dry. These small balls of coconut are called Narikol Laru. It is served with tea. Tilor laru is a kind of sesame candy. Sesame seeds are fried and kept aside. Jaggery is heated to liquefy and then poured into the heap of fried sesame seeds. They get sticky and the substance is rolled into small balls and kept separately to dry. These balls are served with tea. A cup of tea is inseparable from jolpan or pitha. It is always seen with those items whenever they are served. It is served in the form of Black tea, Milk tea, Spiced tea, Lemon tea (adding lemon juice to black tea) etc. It is a hugely consumed beverage in Assam and also can be called a type of dessert.",
    "Tomato Chutney": " A chutney (pronounced [\u02c8\u02a7\u0259\u0288\u0273i\u02d0]) is a spread typically associated with cuisines of the Indian subcontinent. Chutneys are made in a wide variety of forms, such as a tomato relish, a ground peanut garnish, yogurt, or curd, cucumber, spicy coconut, spicy onion, or mint dipping sauce. The word chutney derives from Hindi \u091a\u091f\u0928\u0940 cha\u1e6dn\u012b, deriving from \u091a\u093e\u091f\u0928\u093e ch\u0101\u1e6dn\u0101 'to lick' or 'to eat with appetite'.[1][2] In India, chutney refers to fresh and pickled preparations indiscriminately; however, several Indian languages use the word for fresh preparations only. In India, chutneys can be either made alongside pickles that are matured in the sun for up to two weeks and kept up to a year or, more commonly, are freshly made from fresh ingredients that can be kept a couple of days or a week in the refrigerator. In South India, Chutneys are also known as Pachadi (Telugu: \u0c2a\u0c1a\u0c4d\u0c1a\u0c21\u0c3f, Kannada: \u0caa\u0c9a\u0ca1\u0cbf, Tamil: \u0baa\u0b9a\u0bcd\u0b9a\u0b9f\u0bbf, Malayalam: \u0d2a\u0d1a\u0d4d\u0d1a\u0d1f\u0d3f) which generally refers to traditional South Indian sauces or chutneys served as side dishes. Roughly translated, it refers to a plant which has been pounded or crushed.[3] Pachadis are made of fresh vegetables and are served on the side for dishes like idli, dosa, and pesarattu. Many kinds of vegetables are included. Sometimes the rind of a vegetable is used, such as the peel of the ridged gourd, known as beerapottu pachadi[4] in Telugu. In Tamil Nadu, thogayal or thuvayal (Tamil) are preparations similar to chutney but with a pasty consistency. In Kerala it is also called chammanthi and in Telangana it is called tokku or also pacchadi. Thengai chutney, a coconut-based chutney, is the one being referred to when only 'chutney' is said. Medicinal plants that are believed to have a beneficial effect are sometimes made into chutneys, for example pirandai thuvayal[5] or ridged gourd chutney (peerkangai thuvayal or beerakaaya tokku).[6] Bitter gourd can also serve as a base for a chutney which is like a relish[7] or, as a dried powder.[8] Occasionally, chutneys that contrast in taste and colour can be served together\u2014a favourite combination being a green mint and chili chutney with a contrasting sweet brown tamarind and date chutney.[9][10][11][12][13] Chutneys may be ground with a mortar and pestle or an ammikkal (Tamil). Spices are added and ground, usually in a particular order; the wet paste thus made is saut\u00e9ed in vegetable oil, usually gingelly (sesame) or peanut oil. Electric blenders or food processors can be used as labour-saving alternatives to the stone grinding technique. Western-style chutneys are usually fruit, vinegar, and sugar cooked down to a reduction, with added flavourings. These may include sugar, salt, garlic, tamarind, onion or ginger.[14] Western-style chutneys originated from Anglo-Indians at the time of the British Raj. They recreated Indian chutneys using English orchard fruits\u2014sour cooking apples and rhubarb, for example. They would often contain dried fruit: raisins, currants, and sultanas. They were a way to use a glut of ripened fruit and preserving techniques were similar to sweet fruit preserves using approximately an equal weight of fruit and sugar, the vinegar and sugar acting as preservatives. South Indian chutney powders are made from roasted dried lentils to be sprinkled on idlis and dosas.[15] Peanut chutneys can be made wet or as a dry powder.[16][17] Spices commonly used in chutneys include fenugreek, coriander (also called cilantro), cumin, and asafoetida (hing). Other prominent ingredients and combinations include coriander, capsicum, mint (coriander and mint chutneys are often called \u0939\u0930\u093e hara chutney, Hindi for \"green\"), Tamarind or imli (often called meethi chutney, as \u092e\u093f\u0920\u093e\u0908 meethi in Hindi means \"sweet\"), sooth (or saunth, made with dates and ginger), coconut, onion, prune, tomato, red chili, green chili, mango, lime (made from whole, unripe limes), garlic, coconut, peanut, dahi (yogurt), green tomato, dhaniya pudina (cilantro and mint), peanut (shengdana chutney in Marathi), ginger, red chili powder, tomato onion chutney,[18] cilantro, mint coconut chutney,[19] and apricot.[20] A common chutney variant in Anglo-Indian cuisine uses a tart fruit such as sharp apples, rhubarb or damson pickle made milder by an equal weight of sugar (usually demerara, turbinado or brown sugar to replace jaggery in some Indian sweet chutneys). Vinegar was added to the recipe for English-style chutney that traditionally aims to give a long shelf life so that autumn fruit can be preserved for use throughout the year (as are jams, jellies and pickles) or to be sold as a commercial product. Indian pickles use mustard oil as a pickling agent, but Anglo-Indian style chutney uses malt or cider vinegar which produces a milder product. In Western cuisine, chutney is often eaten with hard cheese or with cold meats and fowl, typically in cold pub lunches.[21] Major Grey's Chutney is a type of sweet and spicy chutney popular in the United States. The recipe was reportedly created by a 19th-century British Army officer of the same name (likely apocryphal) who presumably had resided for a period of time in the Raj. Its characteristic ingredients are mango, raisins, vinegar, lime juice, onion, tamarind extract, sweetening and spices. Several companies produce a Major Grey's Chutney, in India, the UK and the US. Similar in preparation and usage to a pickle, simple spiced chutneys can be dated to 500 BC.[22] Originating in India,[23] As greater imports of foreign and varied foods increased into northern Europe, chutney fell out of favour in Britain. This combined with a greater ability to refrigerate fresh foods and an increasing number of glasshouses meant the British consumption of chutney and pickle was relegated to army usage and individuals residing in colonial India. Chutney resurged in popularity in England around the 1780s as an appetizer. Diego \u00c1lvarez Chanca brought back chili peppers from the Americas to Spain in 1493. He had sailed with Columbus. After discovering their medicinal properties, Chanca developed a chutney to administer them. In the early 17th century, officials of the East India Company on the Indian subcontinent subsisted on preserved foodstuffs such as lime pickles, chutneys and marmalades. (Marmalades proved unpopular due to their sweetness. They were also rare due to a lack of available sugar.) Beginning in the 17th century, fruit chutneys were shipped to various European countries as luxury goods. These imitations were called \"mangoed\" fruits or vegetables, the word 'chutney' being associated with the working class in these countries.[22] Major Grey's Chutney is thought to have been developed by a British officer who had travelled to the Indian subcontinent. The formula was eventually sold to Crosse and Blackwell, a major British food manufacturer, probably in the early 1800s.[24] In the 19th century, types of chutney like Major Grey's or Bengal Club that catered to Western tastes were shipped to Europe from the Indian subcontinent. Generally, these chutneys are fruit, vinegar, and sugar cooked down to a reduction. Thambuli is a type of sauce or chutney eaten in the Indian state of Karnataka. Thambuli is a curd based dish and is usually consumed with hot rice along with hot sambar. Thambuli is derived from the Kannada word thampu (\u0ca4\u0c82\u0caa\u0cc1+\u0cb9\u0cc1\u0cb3\u0cbf ---->\u0ca4\u0c82\u0cac\u0cc1\u0cb3\u0cbf), meaning cool/cold. It is made mostly from greens and carrots, beetroot like vegetables as their main ingredients. It is prepared by grinding the vegetable with the spices and then mixing it with yogurt. All ingredients are used raw (as they are) without any cooking. Thambuli/Tambli/Tambuli is a form of sauce or chutney. There are many varieties of Thumbuli: Menthe Thumbuli, shunti (ginger) thaumbuli, and various other herbal thambulis. The herbal thambuli is prepared with leaves like Basale soppu, kaki kudi soppu, doddapatre soppu (all of them grown in all over Karnataka). Many different seasonal vegetables/herbs can be used in the preparation of thambulis, such as doddapatre leaves (ajwain leaves/karibevu leaves), coriander leaves, poppy seeds, curry leaves and so on. Various recipes for the same exist, with slight variations in the ingredients. Thambuli/Tambli is generally prepared mild and not spicy. Fundamentally, thambuli/tambli has a few simple whole spices, roasted and ground with seasonal vegetables or herbs (some with coconut) added to buttermilk/curds. Tambuli is another authentic Karnataka recipe. In Tamil Nadu, pachadi is eaten fresh and typically made of finely chopped and boiled vegetables such as cucumber or ash gourd, with coconut, green or red chillis and fried in oil with mustard seeds, ginger and curry leaves. Pachadi is commonly eaten with rice and lentil curry. In Kerala, pachadi is prepared in curd similar to Tamil Nadu. Along with sour Pachadi, there exists a sweet variant in Kerala, made with pineapple, grapes or pumpkin.[27] Many varieties made of the same key recipe exist in different parts of Kerala. It is served at restaurants along with vegetable thali rice. It is also included with Sadhya, especially with Kerala Sadhya popular during Onam and Vishu festivals. In Trinidad and Tobago, chutneys are mostly made from green mangoes, coconut or tamarind.[28] An eponymous music genre developed in the country.",
    "Upma": " Upma, uppumavu, or uppittu is a dish of thick porridge from dry-roasted semolina or coarse rice flour.[1] Upma is a famous south indian recipe, it originates from India, most common in Kerala, Andhra Pradesh, Tamil Nadu, Odisha,Telangana,[2] Karnataka, Maharashtrian, and Sri Lankan Tamil dish. Often, depending on preference, it has various seasonings and/or vegetables added during cooking. The different names for the dish derive from the combinations of the word uppu, meaning salt in Tamil and mavu meaning ground grain meal in Tamil.[3] In North India, the dish is called upma. In Maharashtra, the dish traditionally had the name saanja in Marathi. Upma is typically made by first lightly dry roasting semolina (called rava or sooji in India). The semolina is then taken off the fire and kept aside while spices, lentils, onion, ginger, etc are saut\u00e9ed in oil or ghee. The semolina is then added back to the pan and mixed thoroughly. Boiling water is added, and the mixture is stirred until the semolina absorbs the liquid and becomes fluffy in texture.[6][7] There are several ways in which upma is made, and the variations are obtained by either adding or removing spices and vegetables. The texture can vary significantly as well, depending on how much water is added to it, and how long the mixture is allowed to remain on the flame thereafter. The most popular version with wide variations of upma is made with whole or refined ground semolina made out of durum wheat. Sometimes a wide range of vegetables may be added, and may be garnished with a variety of beans (raw or sprouted), cashews and peanuts.  For a variation called masala upma (known as kharabath in Karnataka), sambar masala or garam masala is added along with red chilli powder, instead of green chillies. This variety is more popular in Karnataka, Maharastra, Tamil Nadu and parts of Andhra Pradesh and is usually served in South Indian restaurants. Uppumavu paired with hand-mashed banana is a common breakfast item in Kerala homes. Whole wheat or wheat dalia (cracked wheat) is a common variation of upma in Tamil Nadu, where it is eaten for breakfast or dinner. Sometimes it is cooked with vegetables like peas, carrots, and beans. Upma pesarattu is the most popular version in Andhra Pradesh, Yanam and Telangana. The dish contains upma and pesarattu combined. The upma is eaten by wrapping it in the pesarattu.[8][9] Rice upma, which is mainly popular in Tamil Nadu and southern parts of Karnataka, is referred to as akki tari uppittu (rice coarse flour uppittu). Another variant of upma is prepared with grated coconut instead of onions, especially on holy days, when onion is avoided. This type of upma is generally smeared with ghee at the end of preparation. Dishes similar to upma can be made by substituting small crumbs of leftover bread or idli instead of flour. Upma made from coarser rava known as sajjige is a dish of Udupi cuisine. It is sometimes served along with snacks such as saut\u00e9ed and spiced poha or chevdo. Another variation, particularly as a breakfast dish, is corn upma, eaten with milk and nuts.[10] In Karnataka, upma is also served with another common sweet dish of Karnataka, kesari bhath (\u0c95\u0cc7\u0cb8\u0cb0\u0cbf \u0cac\u0cbe\u0ca4\u0ccd), with a scoop of each on one plate, in a presentation commonly called \"chow chow bath\". In Kerala and Andhra Pradesh, upma is made with flattened rice as a substitute for semolina. This dish is popularly called as Aval upmavu in Malayalam (\u0d05\u0d35\u0d7d \u0d09\u0d2a\u0d4d\u0d2a\u0d41\u0d2e\u0d3e\u0d35\u0d4d) and Atukulu upma (\u0c05\u0c1f\u0c41\u0c15\u0c41\u0c32\u0c41 \u0c09\u0c2a\u0c4d\u0c2e\u0c3e) in Telugu. This variant is also known as aval upma in the Chennai region when made with rice flakes similar to poha. A popular light evening snack is upma made with vermicelli and tomato, peas and carrot. In most parts of Odisha, a popular breakfast consists of sooji upma served with ghugni.",
    "Vada Pav": " Vada pav, alternatively spelt wada pao, (listen\u24d8) is a vegetarian fast food dish native to the Indian state of Maharashtra.[1] The dish consists of a deep fried potato dumpling placed inside a bread bun (pav) sliced almost in half through the middle. It is generally accompanied with one or more chutneys and a green chili pepper.[2] Although it originated as an affordable street food in Mumbai, it is now served in food stalls and restaurants across India. It is also called Bombay burger[3] in keeping with its origins and its resemblance in physical form to a burger.[4] The most famous snack in Mumbai, vada pav is claimed to be a part of the culture of Mumbaikars.[5][6] Batata vada in Marathi literally means \"potato fritter\". It is a combination of the word for \"potato\" (batata) and vada, a type of fried savoury snack. Pav is a derivative of the Portuguese word p\u00e3o, which means bread. The most common theory of the vada pav's origin is that it was invented in the erstwhile mill-heartland of Central Mumbai. \nAshok Vaidya of Dadar is often credited with starting the first vada pav stall outside Dadar railway station in 1966.[7][8][9]:\u200a34\u200a Some sources credit Sudhakar Mhatre who started his business around the same time.[10] One of the earliest kiosks selling vada pav is said to be Khidki Vada Pav, located in Kalyan. It was started in the late 1960s by the Vaze family, who used to hand out vada pavs from a window (Khidki) of their house facing the road.[10] The carbohydrate-rich snack catered to the cotton mill workers of what was then known as Girangaon. This potato dumpling (batata vada) placed inside a pav was quick to make, cheap (~10-15 paisa in 1971[10][11]), and much convenient over the batata bhaji and chapati combination, which couldn't be eaten in overcrowded local trains.[8][10] The closing of textile mills in central Mumbai led to turmoil in the 1970s. Shiv Sena, the homegrown party formed during this transformative time, based itself as a party with Mill workers' interests.[12]\nThe party chief, Balasaheb Thackeray encouraged Marathi people in the 1960s to become entrepreneurs, i.e. start food stalls in ways similar to the South Indians setting up Udupi restaurants.[7][8][13] Shiv Sena attempted to physically and ideologically claim the streets through agitations as well as neighborhood-level events such as Vada pav sammelan (Vada pav jamboree).[9]:\u200a28\u200a[12] This theme has continued even in the recent years, e.g. the 2009 introduction of Shiv vada pav.[14] There are over 20,000 stalls selling vada pav in Mumbai.[15] Mumbai alone has many variations of the food based on the locality.[11] Large fast food restaurant chains such as Kunjvihar Jumbo King in Mulund and Goli Vada Pav also primarily serve vada pav.[11][16] Outside of Mumbai, a variant of vada pav is pav vada which is famous in Nashik. Annually, August 23 is celebrated as World Vada Paav Day.[17] A boiled potato is mashed and mixed with chopped green chilli and garlic, mustard seeds, and spices (usually asafoetida and turmeric). The mass is then shaped into a ball, dipped into gram flour batter and deep fried. The resultant fritter is served by placing inside a bread bun, accompanied with one or more chutneys and fried green chilli.[6] ",
    "Vegetable Stew": "A stew is a combination of solid food ingredients that have been cooked in liquid and served in the resultant gravy. Ingredients can include any combination of vegetables and may include meat, especially tougher meats suitable for slow-cooking, such as beef, pork, venison, rabbit, lamb, poultry, sausages, and seafood. While water can be used as the stew-cooking liquid, stock is also common. A small amount of red wine or other alcohol is sometimes added for flavour. Seasonings and flavourings may also be added. Stews are typically cooked at a relatively low temperature (simmered, not boiled), allowing flavours to mingle. Stewing is suitable for the least tender cuts of meat that become tender and juicy with the slow, moist heat method. This makes it popular for low-cost cooking. Cuts with a certain amount of marbling and gelatinous connective tissue give moist, juicy stews, while lean meat may easily become dry. Stews are thickened by reduction or with flour, either by coating pieces of meat with flour before searing or by using a roux or beurre mani\u00e9, a dough consisting of equal parts fat and flour. Thickeners like cornstarch, potato starch, or arrowroot may also be used. Stews have been made since ancient times. The world's oldest known evidence of stew was found in Japan, dating to the J\u014dmon period.[1][2] Amazonian tribes used the shells of turtles as vessels, boiling the entrails of the turtle and various other ingredients in them. There are recipes for lamb stews and fish stews in the Roman cookery book Apicius, believed to date from the 4th century AD. Le Viandier, one of the oldest cookbooks in French, written in the early 14th century by the French chef known as Taillevent, has ragouts or stews of various types in it.[3] The first written reference to 'Irish stew' is in Byron's \"The Devil's Drive\" (1814): \"The Devil\u00a0... dined on\u00a0... a rebel or so in an Irish stew.\"[4] Meat-based white stews also known as blanquettes or fricass\u00e9es are made with lamb or veal that is blanched or lightly seared without browning, and cooked in stock. Brown stews are made with pieces of red meat that are first seared or browned, before a browned mirepoix and sometimes browned flour, stock and wine are added.",
    "Vindaloo": "Vindaloo or Vindalho is an Indian curry dish, originally from Vasai and Goa. It is based on the Portuguese dish carne de vinha d'alhos.[1][2][3] It is known globally in its British Indian form as a staple of curry house and Indian restaurant menus and is often regarded as a fiery, spicy dish. The traditional recipe uses pork, but alternative versions have been prepared with beef, mutton, prawns, chicken, lamb, vegetables and tofu.[4] A standard element of Goan cuisine derived from the Portuguese carne de vinha d'alhos (meat in wine and garlic marinade; literally \"meat of vine of garlic\"[5]), a vindaloo is a dish of meat (usually pork) marinated in vinegar and garlic.[3][6] The basic structure of the Portuguese dish was the Portuguese sailor's \"preserved\" raw ingredients, packed in wooden barrels of alternate layers of pork and garlic, and soaked in red wine.[citation needed] This was adapted by the local Goan cooks with the substitution of palm vinegar for the red wine, and the addition of spices. It evolved into the localized and easy-to-pronounce dish \"vindaloo\".[7] The British Indian version of vindaloo calls for the meat to be marinated in vinegar, sugar, fresh ginger and spices, then cooked with more spices.[3] Restaurants in Goa offering traditional Goan cuisine prepare vindalho with pork, which is the original recipe. Christians from Kochi, Kerala prepare it using pork or beef, the former being more widely consumed and made. The dish was popularized by Goan cooks (whom the British favoured, because they had no issues in kitchens and bars when handling beef, pork or alcohol) in the British establishments and the ocean-going liners. Restaurants in other parts of India prepare vindalho with other meats (like beef (second most popular), chicken or goat meat or lamb) or even seafood because of local taboos against pork, and these meats are sometimes mixed with cubed potatoes to reduce preparation costs. Even though the word aloo (\u0906\u0932\u0942) means potato in Hindi,[8] traditional Goan vindalho does not include potatoes; the name is from Portuguese with no Hindi etymology. Some Indian versions do include potatoes due to the confusion with the Hindi aloo,[9] and vindaloo dishes outside India often include potatoes. Vindaloo has gained popularity outside of India, where it is typically featured on menus at Indian restaurants. Vindaloo served in restaurants of the United Kingdom differs from the original vindaloo dish; it is simply a spicier version of the standard \"medium (spiciness)\" restaurant curry with the addition of vinegar, potatoes and chili peppers.[10] Vindaloo is one of the spiciest dishes available on British Asian menus where it is served, although British Bangladeshi restaurants have innovated the tindaloo, which is a quite different dish that originated in Bangladesh.[10] The British variation originated from British Bangladeshi restaurants in the 1970s. Vindaloo is considered a predecessor to phall.[11]",

    "Obbattu": " Puran poli is an Indian sweet flatbread that is popular in South India and the state of Maharashtra. It is also known as Puran puri, Holige, Obbattu, Bobbattlu, Poley, Bakshamulu, and Boli. The various names for the flatbread include puran puri (\u0aaa\u0ac1\u0ab0\u0aa3 \u0aaa\u0ac1\u0ab0\u0ac0) or vedmi  in Gujarati, bobbattlu or baksham or oliga in Telugu, Andhra Pradesh holige or obbattu in Kannada, puran poli (\u092a\u0941\u0930\u0923\u092a\u094b\u0933\u0940) in Marathi, payasabolli or simply bolli in Malayalam, Boli  in Tamil, bhakshalu or  pole or polae in Telugu, Telangana and ubbatti or simply poli in Konkani. There is a reference to this dish in the Sanskrit encyclopedia Manas\u014dll\u0101sa in the 12th century written by King Someshvara in Karnataka .[1] Its recipe (as bakshyam) is mentioned in Manucharitra, a 14th-century Telugu encyclopaedia compiled by Allasani Peddanna hailing from present-day Andhra Pradesh.[1]\nBhavaprakash and Bhaishajya Ratnavali written by Govind Dasa state the recipe while explaining it as part of Ayurvedic preparations.[2] Holige is made from senaga pappu, plain flour (wheat flour), maida, jaggery or cane sugar, cardamom powder and/or nutmeg powder, cinnamon powder, ghee and water. In Maharashtra, Maida, Jaggery, nutmeg powder, Chana Dal/Bengal gram, Ghee, and cardamom powder is used. Sometimes, pigeon pea is used in Gujarat. It is commonly used in the state of Karnataka and Tamil Nadu as well. In Andhra Pradesh and other places, pesara pappu, chickpea (senaga pappu) or a mix is used. Other ingredients that may or may not be used are: nuts, dates, and turmeric powder.[3][4] The predominant ingredients are chana, plain flour, jaggery or sugar. 1. Chana: It is a variant of chickpea. It provides fiber, is a major source of protein, may help reduce cholesterol and also contains zinc, folate and calcium Toor dal can be used in place of chana dal and it has similar properties as of chana dal. 2. Plain flour, jaggery or sugar: These are the major sources of carbohydrates. While plain flour adds complex carbohydrates, jaggery and sugar are simple carbohydrates. The method of preparation varies from place to place. There are many varieties of Obbattu including peanut, sugar, coconut, sesame and groundnut flavours. Sometimes grated coconut is added in Konkan, Maharashtra. Coconut palm jaggery may be used. Similarly, a mix of sugar and jaggery can be used as a sweetening agent. Normally nutmeg is used as a flavouring along the coast which is replaced by cardamom elsewhere or sometimes both are used. Methods of rolling the stuffed dough also differ. It can be rolled using rice flour which makes the rolling very convenient. In some recipes flour is not used at all; oil or ghee is used to roll it into a flatbread instead. The rolled bread can be roasted with or without any ghee or oil, which sometimes is smeared after it's completely cooked. In some places, all-purpose flour dough is used after adding a pinch of turmeric which gives it a traditional yellow color. The dish is produced using a sweet filling inside flour dough. This is then rolled out and cooked on a hot griddle, usually with ghee.[5] The size and thickness of puran puri also vary greatly. In Gujarat where the stuffing used is toor dal, it is smaller in size and thicker, whereas in holige with coconut stuffing it is larger in size and thinner. It is the special dish of Maharashtra which is prepared on every occasion at every house, especially during festivals such as Gudhi Padwa, Akshaya Tritiya, Ganesh Chaturthi and Holi. It is eaten with Basundi, Aamras, Kadhi, Amti, etc. In Maharashtra, Puran Poli is eaten with a variant of Amti (flavored sour curry) known as Katachi Amti which is prepared with the remaining water of cooked Chana Dal used to make Puran Poli. Mainly jaggery is used in puran poli for sweetness. It is eaten with Vada (Bhaji) \u2013 a pakora made of all lentils. In some regions of Maharashtra, Puran Poli is served with a dollop of ghee on top, which enhances its flavor and richness. The texture and taste of Puran Poli can vary from region to region, with some areas making it thinner and crispier, while others make it thicker and softer. The process of making Puran Poli can also differ slightly depending on the region, with some using a rolling pin to flatten the dough while others use their hands to shape it. The North-Maharashtra (Khandesh) region makes it using hand and calls it Khapar chi Puran Poli or simply Mande which is huge in size and difficult to make. It is popularly called bobbattu and served on major festive and other occasions. It is one of the sweets of Coastal Andhra. The stuff used inside the bobbattu varies according to the region. It is served hot and eaten by applying a layer of ghee to it. Rava bobbattu is another variant of bobbattu.

    "Bhakri": " Bhakri (bh\u0101kri, bh\u0101kkari, bh\u0101kari, bh\u0101khri, bh\u0101khari) is a round flatbread often eaten in the cuisines of the states of Gujarat, Maharashtra, Rajasthan, and Karnataka in India. The bhakri prepared using jowar or bajra which is coarser than a regular wheat chapati.\nBhakri can be either soft or hard in texture, unlike khakhra in respect to hardness.[1] Different types of millets (jowar, bajra, ragi) are the common grains used for making bhakris. These millet bhakris are popular in the Deccan plateau regions of India (Maharashtra and Northern Karnataka) as well as the semi-arid regions of Rajasthan.[2][3] In the coastal Konkan and Goa regions of western India rice flour is used for making bhakri. The dough for bhakri is prepared by mixing the flour with a small amount of salt in a bowl and kneading into a smooth stiff dough, using hot water.\nThe dough is split into little balls. The ball is then flattened using one's palms. There are two ways to make the bhakri. It is either flattened on a surface by pressing with one's palm or it is made thin by holding the ball in both palms which requires a lot of skill. The tava (pan) is heated and the bhakri is cooked by applying a little water to the upper surface and spreading it all over with the help of the cook's fingers. The other side is also cooked on the tava. Once it is prepared, it is roasted in the direct flame on both the sides.\nA bhakri can be either soft or hard. The hard bhakri basically has a hard outer layer to add a crunch.[6] Bhakri is typically served with yogurt, garlic chutney, pithla, baingan bharta, thecha (chutney made of green chillies and peanuts), preparations of green leafy vegetables and raw onion.[3] In northern parts of Karnataka, it is served with stuffed brinjal curry. In Vidarbha, it is eaten with \"jhunka\" \u2013 a coarse and thick variant of \"pithla.\" It has traditionally been the rural staple[3] which would be carried to the farm at the crack of dawn and make up for both breakfast and lunch. In the fields, bhakri even used to serve as a plate, on which chutney, kharda or thecha was served and eaten together. In Khandesh region, bhakri and shev bhaji (thick savory curry prepared from sev) is a very popular dish. In the coastal regions like Konkan and Goa, the rice flour bhakris are mainly served with fish curry. In modern days, bhakhris have increasingly been replaced by wheat rotis and phulkas but they still retain popularity in many regions and as specialty dishes.",

    "Undhiyu": " Undhiyu (Gujarati- \u0a89\u0a81\u0aa7\u0ac0\u0aaf\u0ac1) is a Gujarati mixed vegetable dish that is a regional specialty of Surat, Gujarat, India. The name of this dish comes from the Gujarati word Undhu (Gujarati-  \u0a89\u0a81\u0aa7\u0ac1), which translates to upside down, since the dish is traditionally cooked upside down underground in earthen pots, termed \u0aae\u0abe\u0a9f\u0ab2\u0ac1 (\"Matlu\"), which are fired from above. The dish is a seasonal one, comprising the vegetables that are available on the South Gujarat coastline, including the Surat, Navsari and Valsad regions, during the winter. It includes (amongst others) green beans or new peas (typically used along with the tender pod), unripe banana, small eggplants, muthia (dumplings/fritters made with fenugreek leaves and spiced chickpea flour (besan) or handva no lot,[1] and either steamed or fried), potatoes, and purple yam, and sometimes plantain.  These are spiced with a dry curry paste that typically includes cilantro leaves, ginger, garlic, green chili pepper and sugar and sometimes includes freshly grated coconut.[2] The mixture is slow cooked for a long time, with some vegetable oil and a very small amount of water sufficient to steam the root vegetables. The finished preparation is dry: individual chunks of vegetables are coated with a thin layer of spice and oil but retain their shape: the contents of the dish must therefore be stirred relatively infrequently during the cooking. Crisp vegetables such as bean pods must ideally retain a little of their crunchy texture. To ensure that no individual component is overcooked, the vegetables may need to be cooked in stages: the root vegetables and eggplant are half-cooked before adding the quick-cooking bean pods and ripe plantain. The finished dish is garnished with chopped cilantro leaf and lemon or lime juice before serving. Surti undhiyu (\u0ab8\u0ac1\u0ab0\u0aa4\u0ac0 \u0a89\u0a81\u0aa7\u0ac0\u0aaf\u0ac1) is a variant that is served with puri at weddings and banquets. Again it is a mixed vegetable casserole, made with red lentils and seasoned with spices, grated coconut, and palm sugar in a mild sauce.  It is garnished with chopped peanuts and toasted grated coconut, and served with rice.[3] Kathiyawadi undhiyu (\u0a95\u0abe\u0aa0\u0abf\u0aaf\u0abe\u0ab5\u0abe\u0aa1\u0ac0 \u0a89\u0a81\u0aa7\u0ac0\u0aaf\u0ac1) is deep red in color and far spicier. It is popular in the Kathiyawad region. Made with fried chunks of vegetables, it is often served with roti or bajri rotla (\u0aac\u0abe\u0a9c\u0ab0\u0ac0 \u0ab0\u0acb\u0a9f\u0ab2\u0abe).[4] Undhiyu with puri and shrikhand is often eaten in Gujarati houses during the winter. The theme of cooking the seasonal winter vegetables into a stew is common across the Indian subcontinent and around the world. A few common examples are: \u0d05\u0d35\u0d3f\u0d2f\u0d7d (Aviyal) from Kerala cuisine is a spicy mixed vegetable stew, \u09b6\u09c1\u0995\u09cd\u09a4\u09cb (Shukto) from Bengali cuisine, while \u0b38\u0b28\u0b4d\u0b24\u0b41\u0b33\u0b3e (Santu\u1e37a) from the Odia cuisine shares more similarities with Undhiyu as Odia food culture too revolves around mild and sweet main courses just like its Gujarati counterpart. The French cuisine has its equivalent dish, the famous Ratatouille.",

    "Chhenagaja": "Chhena gaja (Odia: \u0b1b\u0b47\u0b28\u0b3e \u0b17\u0b1c\u0b3e) is a sweet dish from Balasore,Odisha,India.[1] Unlike some other popular chhena-based Odia desserts, such as rasagola, which have spread throughout India, the chhena gaja remains largely popular within the state itself. Although the ingredients of chhena gaja are essentially the same as that of rasagola and chhena poda, the dishes are very different in taste. One of the best places to savor chhena gajas is Pahala, near Bhubaneswar.[2] However, chhena gaja is equally popular all over Odisha. Chhena gajas are prepared by combining chhena, similar to cottage cheese, and sooji (semolina), and kneading the dough thoroughly. Water is squeezed out from the mixture, which is then dried briefly until it acquires the right consistency. It is then molded into palm-sized rectangular shapes (gajas), boiled in thick sugar syrup. Sometimes, the gajas are then allowed to dry a little more, in which case the sugar may occasionally crystallize on the surface.",
    "Pantua": " Pantua (Bengali: \u09aa\u09be\u09a8\u09cd\u09a4\u09c1\u09af\u09bc\u09be) is a local confection from the Indian subcontinent, notable in West Bengal, Eastern India and Bangladesh.[1] It is a traditional Bengali sweet made of deep-fried balls of semolina, chhena, milk, ghee and sugar syrup. Pantuas range in colour from pale brown to nearly black depending on how long they are fried. Rose water, cardamom or other flavourings are sometimes added to the sweet. Pantua is very similar to the cheese-based fried sweet ledikeni. The distinctive feature of ledikeni is its molten sugar syrup of lightly flavored cardamom powder.[2] The name ledikeni is a rendition of \"Lady Canning\" and was first used by confectioner Bhim Chandra Nag, when he renamed his pantuas specially prepared on the occasion of the birthday of Countess Charlotte Canning, wife of Governor-General Charles Canning.[3] A sweet very similar to the modern pantua and ledikeni, but made of rice flour, is mentioned in the 12th century Sanskrit-language text Manasollasa.[4] Pantua is similar to gulab jamun,[1] and could be called a Bengali variant of that dish.[5]  This Indian cuisine\u2013related article is a stub.

    "Red Rice": "Red rice is rice that is colored red due to natural anthocyanin content. It is usually eaten unpolished or partially polished, and has a red bran layer, rather than the more common pale brown. Red rice has a nutty flavor. It has the highest nutritional value[quantify] among rices eaten with the bran intact.[citation needed] Some strains of red rice, when eaten dehusked (analogous to ordinary brown rice), has a lower glycemic index compared to white rice (Basmati and Jasmine), which is polished. However, research also indicates that polishing red rice removes this difference.[1] Red rice contains higher antioxidant levels compared to white rice,[2] though what they actually do in the human body is unclear. Dehusked red rice is also a richer source of iron, magnesium, calcium and zinc than white rice.[3] The same can be said of ordinary brown rice.[4] Varieties of red rice include:",
    "Shondesh": "Sandesh (Bengali: \u09b8\u09a8\u09cd\u09a6\u09c7\u09b6 Sh\u00f4ndesh) is a dessert, originating from the Bengal region in the eastern part of the Indian subcontinent, created with milk and sugar.[1] Some recipes of sandesh call for the use of chhena or paneer (which is made by curdling the milk and separating the whey from it) instead of milk itself.[2] Some people in the region of Dhaka make a variety of sandesh called pranahara (literally 'heart stealer') which is softer and made with mawa and yogurt.[3] The Gupo/Gufo style of sandesh from Guptipara is considered by some to be the \"first branded sweet of Bengal\".[4] A sweet dish by the name sandesh is mentioned in medieval Bengali literature, including Krittibas' Ramayana and lyrics of Chaitanya Mahaprabhu. However, the ingredients of this original dish are not known.[5] This dish was most likely made of solidified kheer, thus being different from the modern chhena-based sandesh.[6][7] It is hard to determine when exactly sandesh started referring mainly to the chhena-based sweet instead of the kheer-based sweet. However, it is known that by the second half of the 19th century, sandesh commonly referred to the chhena-based sweet.[8] Sandesh can be made with the use of chhena or paneer. The simplest kind of sandesh in Bengal is the makha sandesh (makha, meaning 'kneaded'). It is prepared by tossing the chhena lightly with sugar over low heat. When shaped into balls, it is called Kanchagolla (kancha, meaning 'raw' and golla, meaning 'ball'). For more complex and elaborately prepared sandesh, the chhena is dried and pressed, flavored with fruit, and sometimes even colored, and cooked to many different consistencies. Sometimes it is filled with syrup, blended with coconut or kheer, and molded into a variety of shapes such as conch shells, elephants, and fish. Another variant is nolen gurer sandesh, which is made with gur or jaggery. It is known for its brown or caramel colour that comes from nolen gur.",
    "Dhebra": "Dhebra (Gujarati: \u0aa2\u0ac7\u0aac\u0ab0\u0abe) is an Indian bread from the Gujarati cuisine made of pearl millet flour. When flavoured with fenugreek leaves, it's called methi dhebra.  It is a cuisine cousin of the flatbread called Thalipeeth in Marathi. To create dhebra, sufficient water and salt are mixed with millet flour and whole wheat flour to make a dough.[1] The resulting dough balls are then flattened on a chakla to a round shape using a belan (rolling pin). Then, both sides of the dhebra are lightly fried with vegetable oil on a tava, until small brown spots appear.[2] This is a plain dhebra, made of millet flour (bajra atta). Because it is the simplest dhebra to make, it is the most commonly consumed in India. Another variety is the methi dhebra, in which methi (fenugreek leaves) are added as flavour. There is also dhebra made with bottle gourd called dudhi na dhebra.[3] Methi Dhebra can be made rotli sized or smaller (thicker) puri sized.[4] Fenugreek, Garlic, Guardian, Bottle Gourd, Cumin",
    "Benne Dose": " Davangere benne dose (Kannada: \u0ca6\u0cbe\u0cb5\u0ca3\u0c97\u0cc6\u0cb0\u0cc6 \u0cac\u0cc6\u0ca3\u0ccd\u0ca3\u0cc6 \u0ca6\u0ccb\u0cb8\u0cc6, d\u0101va\u1e47agere be\u1e47\u1e47e d\u014dse) or butter dosa is a type of dosa which traces its origin to the city of Davanagere in Karnataka, India. The term \"benne dose\" in Kannada means simply \"butter dosa.\" It is prepared by the addition of a generous amount of butter while preparing the normal dosa, and accompanied by coconut chutney. Its batter is very different comprising a mixture of rice, dal, puffed rice, etc., and is prepared on a wood-fired pan. It is similar to masala dosa or set dosa but smaller in size, made out of rice batter and much more butter. It is served with liberal helpings of butter sprinkled on it.[1][2][3][4] Some of the variants of the benne dose: Davanagere Benne Dose has an interesting history dating back to 1928.  A lady named Chennamma migrated to Davanagere with her children and started preparing Dosa, Chutney and Potato Palya with her own unique recipe.  She started her tiny eatery in front of Savalagi Drama Theater near Vasantha Talkies at Davanagere which became popular for its taste. Initially, she used to prepare Dosa with Ragi batter.  Later by 1938, her children started preparing Dosa with Rice batter, puffed rice and dal with generous dollops of butter.  This became extremely popular with locals very soon. This was carried on by Chennamma's two sons Shanthappa and Mahadevappa.  They both opened their own eateries. Shanthappa opened his eatery in 1944 called \"Shantappa Dosa Hotel\" and this is the oldest Benne Dose eatery of Davanagere located near Clock Tower in Old Davanagere. This is presently run by his son Ganesh.[5] Mahadevappa opened his eatery near Vasantha theatre which does not exist today.  His elder son Ravi has a Benne Dose eatery on Church Road as Ravi benne dose hotel. [6] His younger son Viji also has his own Vijji Benne Dosa eatery at dental college road. Apart from these, there are many popular eateries serving delicious Benne Dosa in Davanagere.  Popular amongst them are Sri.

    "Pashti": " Pashti is a flatbread common to the Southern Indian subcontinent. It is usually made with rice flour and pan-fried in ghee/cooking oil. A pashti is usually served with either chutneys, usually peanut (Phalli Ki Chutney) or with curry. Pashti is made by kneading rice flour in hot water, as cold water tends to form lumps.\nThe dough is then rolled out with a rolling pin, and circles are cut out by pressing a plate or jar top onto the dough.",
    "Phulka": " Chapati (alternatively spelled chapathi; pronounced as IAST: cap\u0101t\u012b, cap\u0101\u1e6d\u012b, c\u0101p\u0101\u1e6di), also known as roti, rooti, rotee, rotli,  rotta, safati, shabaati, phulka (in Marathi),  chapo (in East Africa), sada roti (in the Caribbean), poli, and roshi (in the Maldives),[1] is an unleavened flatbread originating from the Indian subcontinent and is a staple in India, Nepal, Bangladesh, Pakistan, Kyrgyzstan, Sri Lanka, the Arabian Peninsula, East Africa, and the Caribbean.[2] Chapatis are made of whole-wheat flour known as atta, mixed into dough with water, oil (optional), and salt (optional) in a mixing utensil called a parat, and are cooked on a tava (flat skillet).[3][4] It is a common staple in the Indian subcontinent as well as amongst expatriates from the Indian subcontinent throughout the world. Chapatis were also introduced to other parts of the world by immigrants from the Indian subcontinent, particularly by Indian merchants to Central Asia, Southeast Asia, East Africa, and the Caribbean.[5] The word chapati is derived from the Sanskrit word \u091a\u0930\u094d\u092a\u091f\u0940[6] (charpa\u1e6d\u012b). From a derivative of Sanskrit *\u091a\u0930\u094d\u092a (charpa, \u201cflat\u201d). Chapati is a form of roti or rotta (bread). The words are often used interchangeably. The word chapat (Marathi: \u091a\u093e\u092a\u091f) means \"slap\" or \"flat\", describing the traditional method of forming round pieces of thin dough by slapping the dough between the wetted palms of the hands. With each slap, the piece of dough is rotated. The word chapati is noted in the 16th-century document Ain-i-Akbari  by Abu'l-Fazl ibn Mubarak, vizier of Mughal Emperor Akbar.[2] Chapatis are one of the most common forms of wheat bread, a staple food in the Indian subcontinent. The carbonized wheat grains discovered at the excavations at Mohenjo-daro are of a similar variety to an endemic species of wheat still found in India. The Indus Valley is known to be one of the ancestral lands of cultivated wheat. Chapatis, along with rotis, were introduced to other parts of the world by immigrants from the Indian subcontinent, particularly by Indian merchants who settled in Southeast Asia and the Caribbean islands.[5] In 1857, the chapati likely may have played a role in the Indian mutiny Chapati Movement. Chapatis are made using a soft dough comprising wheat flour and water.[9] It is more finely ground than most Western-style whole wheat flours. Chapati dough is typically prepared with flour and water, kneaded with the knuckles of the hand made into a fist and left to rest for at least 10 or 15 minutes to an hour for the gluten in the dough to relax. After proofing, the dough becomes softer and more pliable. Small portions of the dough are pinched off and formed into round balls that are pressed between the two palms to form discs which are then dipped into flour and rolled out on a circular rolling board (a chakla), using a rolling pin known as a velan or belan, into a flat disc.[10] There are also automatic roti makers which automate the whole process.[11] The rolled-out dough is then thrown on the preheated dry tava and cooked on both sides. In some regions of the Indian subcontinent chapatis are only partially cooked on the skillet, and then cooked directly over a flame, which makes them puff up. The hot steam cooks the chapati rapidly from the inside. In some parts of northern India and eastern Pakistan, this is called a phulka. In southern parts of India, it is called a pulka. It is also possible to puff up the roti directly on the tava.[12] Once cooked, chapatis are often topped with butter or ghee.[13] In western regions of Maharashtra, some oil is added inside the rolled-out dough and then put on the tava; this is distinct from paratha. Chapati diameter and thickness vary from region to region. Chapatis made in domestic kitchens are usually not larger than 15 centimetres (6\u00a0in) to 18 centimetres (7\u00a0in) in diameter since the tava on which they are made comes in sizes that fit comfortably on a domestic stovetop. Tavas were traditionally made of unglazed earthenware, but are now typically made from metal. The shape of the rolling pin also varies from region to region. Some households simply use a kitchen worktop as a sort of pastry board, but round flat-topped \"boards\" made of wood, stone, or stainless steel are available specifically for rolling out chapatis.[5] In most parts of the Indian subcontinent, there is a distinction made between chapati and other related flatbreads eaten in the region like roti, paratha, kulcha, puri and naan based on cooking technique, texture and use of different types of flours. For example, parathas are either made layered by spreading them with ghee, folding and rolling out again into a disc which turns out flakey once cooked, or are filled with spinach, dal or cooked radish or potato. Parathas are mostly made using all-purpose flour instead of whole wheat flour.[14] There are many regional varieties of chapati in India: In the Maldives, chapatis are traditionally eaten for breakfast along with a dish known as mas huni.[15] Flatbreads are staples of Indian food. Chapatis go well with curries, dry sabzis or sabjis (vegetables cooked in gravy), chutneys or dal.[16]",

    "Keema Matar": "Keema matar (English: \"mince and peas\"),[1] also rendered Qeema matar, is a dish from the Indian subcontinent associated with the Mughals. The term is derived from Chaghatai Turkic \u0642\u06cc\u0645\u0647 (minced meat) which is cognate with Turkish k\u0131yma (minced or ground meat). \"Keema matar\" was popularly eaten in the courts of Mughal India. The dish was originally called \"keema matar\" but is referred to as \"matar qeema\" nowadays. In Pakistan, due to the way the letter \u0642 is pronounced, the dish is spelled with a \"q\" (qeema), but in India and Bangladesh it is written with a \"k\" (keema). A popular variation of this dish is aloo keema (potatoes and minced meat).[2] It is commonly cooked in North Indian and Pakistani households. Keema is also used as a filling for samosas.[3] Ingredients of this dish are already specified in its name i.e. \"Matar\" (pea) and \"Keema\" (mince).

    "Kosha Mangsho": "Mutton curry (also referred to as kosha mangsho,[1]  lamb curry,[2] or goat curry[3][4]) is a dish that is prepared from goat meat (or sometimes lamb meat) and vegetables.[5] The dish is found in different variations across all states, countries and regions of the Indian subcontinent and the Caribbean. Mutton curry was originally prepared putting all the ingredients together in a earthen pot and slow cooking the whole curry by wood fire on a clay oven.[6] Today it is cooked using pressure cookers and slow cookers after briefly saut\u00e9ing all the ingredients and spices in a big wok.[6] The steadily cooked mutton becomes more tender than normally cooked mutton. Mutton curry is generally served with rice or with Indian breads, such as naan or parotta.[7] The dish can also be served with ragi, a cereal.[8] Common ingredients used to prepare mutton curry[9] include: mutton or goat meat, salt, turmeric powder, mustard oil, ginger garlic paste, dahi (yogurt), assortment of spices, onion, chilli, tomato, and coriander leaves.[10] In Odisha, mutton curry is always made of khasi goat meat (meat of young castrated male goat). There are many varieties of goat meat curries prepared in Odisha. Simple and flavorful ingredients are used to prepare the curry and usually served with roti, naan or in Western Odisha, puffed rice (mudhi). Some of the popular curries are:[11] While mutton curry is usually eaten with rice, in Western Odisha, Mangsa Kash\u0101 is particularly relished with mudhi (puffed rice). Mangsa Kash\u0101 is said to be the predecessor of the popular Bengali goat curry dish known as Kosha Mangsho most probably introduced by the Odia cooks who moved to West Bengal during the British rule to work in the kitchens of Bengali families.[12] Mutton is typically cooked in Bihar in curried form. In addition to fish and chicken, mutton is common in Bihari cuisine. Mutton curry is traditionally served with Malpua on Holi,[13] while it is eaten with rice in a routine everyday meal. In Champaran, mutton is cooked in a sealed earthen pot as a one-pot curry.[14] Mutton curry has a special place in Surati cuisine. A rich mutton dish known as Tapelu which finds its origins in the kitchens of the Surati Khatri community, is often cooked in large batches, especially during festivities.[15] [16] Goat offal also finds a place in the cuisine of Surat.[15] Kosha mangsho is the Bengali version of mutton curry. It traditionally has less juice and more gravy than mutton curries eaten in other parts of India.[17] This dish is prepared in a kosha style, which involves retaining the mutton's flavor and moisture using slow cooking and saut\u00e9eing methods.[18] Kosha mangsho is traditionally prepared as part of the celebration of Kali Puja,[19] a festival dedicated to the Hindu goddess Kali, celebrated on the New Moon day of the Hindu month Kartik. Railway mutton curry is a British Raj colonial-era dish that was served on long-distance trains.[20][21][22] The dish was served with dinner rolls.[20] Tamarind was originally used to extend its shelf life.[20] Some restaurants serve the dish in present-day times, such as Oh! Calcutta! restaurant in Kolkata, India.[23][24] Railway mutton curry is prepared using a coconut milk base.[24] Black Mutton curry (also referred to as konkani black mutton) is a dish that is prepared from goat or lamb meat, charred coconuts, and a signature spice blend. The regional dish originated in the Konkani[25] district of Maharashtra, India. Black Mutton curry was originally made by preparing a black spice paste consisting of charred coconuts, onions and peppers with spices which was then cooked low and slow in a cast iron wok. The cooked paste was added with the mutton along with fresh herbs and spices in an earthen pot and cooked low and slow till tender. The curry is typically served with breads such as Bhakari, Chapati, Pav or rice. The dish utilizes a unique blend of spices called the Maharashtrian garam masala, which consists of cardamom, nutmeg, khus khus (poppy seeds), saunth (dried ginger), and many other Mughlai spices which lend the black mouton an intoxicating flavor and a robust color.[26] In 2012, in the Midlands, England, trading standards officers working undercover went to twenty restaurants that were randomly chosen and bought 39 lamb curry and kebab dishes.[27] Four of the dishes contained no lamb, instead using a mixture that contained beef, pork or chicken.[27] In the investigation, it was found that only three lamb curries out of the nineteen tested contained only lamb. Most were found to consist of a mixture of lamb with beef or chicken.[27] Additionally, all of the twenty lamb kebabs that were sampled contained meats in addition to lamb that was mixed with it, such as beef, pork or chicken.[27] Hot",
    "Mulligatawny": " Mulligatawny (/\u02ccm\u028cl\u026a\u0261\u0259\u02c8t\u0254\u02d0ni/ \u24d8) is a soup which originated from Tamil cuisine. The name originates from the Tamil words mi\u1e37agu (\u0bae\u0bbf\u0bb3\u0b95\u0bc1 'black pepper'), and thanneer (\u0ba4\u0ba3\u0bcd\u0ba3\u0bc0\u0bb0\u0bcd, 'water') (often pronounced with a silent r); literally, \"pepper-water\".[1] It is related to the dish rasam.[citation needed] Main ingredients commonly include chicken, mutton, and lentils.[2] Mulligatawny was popular in India by the end of the 18th century,[1] and by the 19th century it began to appear in cookbooks of the day, with each cook (or cookbook) featuring its own recipe.[3] Recipes for mulligatawny varied greatly at that time and over the years (e.g., Maria Rundell's A New System of Domestic Cookery contained three versions), and later versions of the soup included British modifications that included meat,[4] although the local Madras (modern Chennai) recipe on which it was based did not.[5] Early references to it in English go back to 1784.[6] In 1827, William Kitchiner wrote that it had become fashionable in Britain: Mullaga-Tawny signifies pepper water. The progress of inexperienced peripatetic Palaticians[a] has lately been arrested by this outlandish word being pasted on the windows of our Coffee-Houses; it has, we believe, answered the \"Restaurateurs'\" purpose, and often excited John Bull, to walk in and taste\u2014the more familiar name of Curry Soup\u2014would, perhaps, not have had sufficient of the charms of novelty to seduce him from his much-loved Mock-Turtle.\nIt is a fashionable Soup and a great favourite with our East Indian friends, and we give the best receipt[b] we could procure for it.[8][9] By the mid-1800s, Arthur Robert Kenney-Herbert (1840\u20131916), under the pen name Wyvern, wrote in his popular Culinary Jottings that \"really well-made mulligatunny is ... a thing of the past.\"[5] He also noted that this simple recipe prepared by poorer natives of Madras as made by \"Mootoosamy\" was made by pounding: a dessert-spoonful of tamarind, six red chillies, six cloves of garlic, a tea-spoonful of mustard seed, a salt-spoonful of fenugreek seed, twelve black peppercorns, a tea-spoonful of salt, and six leaves of karay-pauk. When worked to a paste, he adds a pint of water, and boils the mixture for a quarter of an hour. While this is going on, he cuts up two small onions, puts them into a chatty, and fries them in dessert-spoonful of ghee till they begin to turn brown, when he strains the pepper-water into the chatty, and cooks the mixture for five minutes, after which it is ready. The pepper-water is, of course, eaten with a large quantity of boiled rice, and is a meal in itself. The English, taking their ideas from this simple composition, added other condiments, with chicken, mutton, &c., thickened the liquid with flour and butter, and by degrees succeeded in concocting a soupe grasse of a decidedly acceptable kind.[5][10] According to the Oxford Companion to Food, the simplest version of the soup included chicken or mutton, fried onion, and spices.[2] More complex versions may call for \"a score of ingredients\". Versions originating in southern India commonly called for lentils.[2] The dish is featured in the sketch Dinner for One which is \nbroadcast every New Year's Eve in Scandinavia and Germany.[11] In episode 6 from season 7 of the TV show Seinfeld, the character Elaine casually orders a mulligatawny soup from the infamous Soup Nazi's soup stand. However, after Elaine comments that the Soup Nazi looks like Al Pacino, he bans Elaine from the soup stand for one year and she does not get her soup. Alfred mentions that mulligatawny is Batman's favorite soup in Batman #701.[12] Hot, often with rice",
    "Lassi": " Lassi (pronounced [l\u0259s\u02d0i]) is a yogurt\u2013based beverage with a smoothie-like consistency.[1][2] It has been called \"the most popular and traditional yogurt-based drink\" in India.[3] It has also been described as the form in which yogurt \"is most cherished and unbeatably popular in [...] Punjab\", its \"best-loved summer drink\", and \"the air conditioner of the Punjab\".[4] Lassi originated in the Punjab region of the Indian subcontinent.[3] The word lassi means yogurt mixed with water in Punjabi and Hindi-Urdu.[1][5] Lassi is prepared by blending yogurt, water, and spices. In Punjab, the yogurt is traditionally made from water buffalo milk.[4] However, variations of lassi can be prepared in different ways. Cumin and cardamom are the most common spices added to lassi.[6] Lassi is traditionally served in a clay cup known as kulhar.[6] Namkin or Namkeen (salty) lassi is made by adding salt, black pepper, cumin, and sugar to the yogurt-water mixture.[1][7] Lassi masalewal (spicy lassi) is made by adding ingredients such as almonds, ginger, green chilies, and pistachios to namkin lassi.[1] Meethi (sweet) lassi is made by adding cardamom, rosewater, and saffron to the yogurt-water mixture.[1][3] Bhang lassi is a cannabis-infused drink that contains bhang, a liquid derivative of cannabis, which has effects similar to other eaten forms of cannabis.[8] It is legal in many parts of India and mainly sold during Holi, when pakoras containing bhang are also sometimes eaten. Uttar Pradesh is known to have licensed bhang shops, and in many places, one can buy bhang products and drink bhang lassis.[9] Fruits such as mangos and strawberries may be added to the yogurt-water mixture to yield, for example, mango lassi and strawberry lassi.[1][3] In 2013, a group of IIT Kharagpur students lobbied Google to name its next Android version Lassi.[10] Chilled",
    "Ghugni": " Ghugni or guguni is a dish made of peas or chickpeas.[1] Different variations of the dish use different types of peas or chickpeas, such as black gram, green peas, or white peas. It is a snack native to the Indian subcontinent. [a][3] The peas are soaked overnight and then boiled in water. The peas are added to a gravy that includes coconut, ginger paste, garlic paste, cumin, tamarind paste, and cilantro.[3] It is then served with puffed rice (kurmura) and at times with hot onion pakoda or bhajiya.[4] Ghugni is often served with dhuska, a fermented rice-lentil dish.[1] In Calcutta, ghugni is often eaten with puris.[5]\nIn Odisha, ghugni can be prepared without onion and garlic as well. The preparation method is almost the same as in Bengal but uses less oil and spices. Ghugni is often served with Puri, Mudhi(muri,murmura,puffed rice)or any regular Odia snacks i.e Bara,Singada etc. In Bihar, green chickpeas or freshly harvested green peas are used for the dish. They are lightly pan-fried in mustard oil with some cumin seeds and green chillies and are not curried like eastern Indian versions.[6] In Bengal, ghugni is made from dry white peas.[7] Some versions include meat, such as goat or even lamb or chicken. The meat is usually minced or in bite-sized pieces, mostly for flavoring. \"Mangsher ghugni\" or meat keema ghugni has been described as a \"Kolkata trademark\".[8][9] In the states of Bihar and Jharkhand and Eastern Uttar Pradesh, ghugni is often paired with dhuska, which is made by deep-frying batter of fermented rice and dal. Ghugni is most commonly made using kala chana (black chickpeas). The combo of ghugni and dhuska is popular in Bhojpuri, Magadhi and Maithil cuisines.[10]  This Indian cuisine\u2013related article is a stub. You can help Wikipedia by expanding it.",
    "Pakora": " Pakora (pronounced [p\u0259\u02c8k\u0254\u02d0\u027da]) is a fritter originating from the Indian subcontinent. They are sold by street vendors and served in restaurants across South Asia.[5] It often consists of vegetables such as potatoes and onions, which are coated in seasoned gram flour batter and deep fried. The pakora is known also under other spellings including pikora, pakoda, pakodi and regional names such as bhaji, bhajiya, bora, ponako, and chop. The word pako\u1e5b\u0101 is derived from Sanskrit \u092a\u0915\u094d\u0935\u0935\u091f pakvava\u1e6da,[6] a compound of pakva ('cooked') and va\u1e6da ('a small lump') or its derivative va\u1e6daka, 'a round cake made of pulse fried in oil or ghee'.[7] The word Bhajji is derived from the Sanskrit word Bharjita meaning fried.[8] Some divergence of transliteration may be noted in the third consonant in the word. The sound is a hard 'da' in the Telugu language and the 'ra' sound would be an incorrect pronunciation. The sound is the retroflex flap [\u027d], which is written in Hindi with the letter \u0921\u093c, and in Urdu with the letter \u0691. However, in the International Alphabet of Sanskrit Transliteration, the Hindi letter \u0921\u093c is transliterated as <\u1e5b>, popular or non-standard transliterations of Hindi use <d> for this sound, because etymologically, it derives from \u0921 /\u0256/. The occurrence of this consonant in the word pakora has given rise to two common alternative spellings in English: pakoda, which reflects its etymology, and pakora, which reflects its phonology. An early variation of pakora appears in Sanskrit literature and Tamil Sangam literature but the recipe is not clearly provided as they only mention it as 'a round cake made of pulse fried in oil' and 'crispy fried vegetables' which were served as part of the meals.[9][10] Early known recipes come from Manasollasa (1130 CE) cookbook which mentions \"Parika\" (pakoda) and the method of preparing it with vegetables and gram flour.[11] Lokopakara (1025 CE) cookbook also mentions unique pakora recipe where gram flour is pressed into fish-shaped moulds and fried in mustard oil.[12] Pakoras are made by coating ingredients, usually vegetables, in a spiced batter, and then deep frying them. Common varieties of pakora use onion, masoor dal (lentil),[13] suji (semolina),[14] chicken, arbi root and leaves, eggplant, potato, chili pepper, spinach, paneer, cauliflower, mint, plantain or baby corn.[15] The batter is most commonly made with gram flour or a mixture of gram flour and rice flour but variants can use other flours, such as buckwheat flour. The spices used in the batter are up to the cook and may be chosen due to local tradition or availability; often these include fresh and dried spices such as chilli, fenugreek, ginger, cardamom, turmeric and coriander. Pakoras are eaten as a snack or appetiser, often accompanied by chutney or raita. They are also offered with masala chai to guests at Indian wedding ceremonies. A gram flour fritter is known in Tamil Nadu and Sri Lanka as Pakoda or bajji, Gujarat as bhajia, in Maharashtra as bhaji, in Andhra Pradesh/Telangana and Karnataka as bajji or \"Pakodi\". Pakoda may be interpreted in these states as deep fried balls of finely chopped onions, green chilis, and spices mixed in gram flour.",
    "Kofta": " Kofta also called  (archaic name patty) is a family of meatball or meatloaf dishes found in South Asian, Central Asian, Balkan, Middle Eastern, North African, and South Caucasian cuisines. In the simplest form, koftas consist of balls of minced meat\u2014usually beef, chicken, pork, lamb or mutton, or a mixture\u2014mixed with spices and sometimes other ingredients.[1] The earliest known recipes are found in early Arab cookbooks and call for ground lamb. There are many national and regional variations. There are also vegetable and uncooked versions. Shapes vary and include balls, patties, and cylinders. Sizes typically vary from that of a golf ball to that of an orange. In English, kofta is a loanword borrowed from the Urdu \u06a9\u0648\u0641\u062a\u06c1 and Persian \u06a9\u0648\u0641\u062a\u0647 kofta meaning pounded meat.[2][3][4][1] The earliest extant use of the word in the Urdu language is attested from the year 1665 in Mulla Nusrati's \u02bfAl\u012b\u00a0N\u0101ma.[5][6] It was first used in English in Qanoon-e-Islam in 1832,[7] and then by James Wise in 1883.[8] The languages of the region of the kofta's origin have adopted the word with minor phonetic variations.[9] Similar foods are called in other languages croquettes, dumplings, meatballs, rissoles, and turnovers.[9][10] The ancient Roman cookbook Apicius included many meatball-type recipes.[11] The first appearance of recipes for kofta are in the earliest Arab cookbooks.[12][9] The earliest recipes are for large ground lamb meatballs triple-glazed in a mixture of saffron and egg yolk.[12] This glazing method spread to the West, where it is referred to as \"gilding\" or \"endoring\".[9] Koftas moved to India; according to Alan Davidson, Nargisi Kofta was served at the Mughal court.[9] Koftas are found from the Indian subcontinent through Central Asia, the Middle East, the Balkans, and northern Africa.[9] Koftas are found in the traditional cuisines of Armenia,[13][14] Afghanistan,[13] Albania, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Bulgaria,[9] Georgia,[14] Lebanon, Egypt,[13][14] Greece,[9] India,[9][13][15] Iran, Morocco,[9] Pakistan,[16] Romania,[17] Serbia, North Macedonia, and Turkey.[13][18] Kofta is also a popular dish among Assyrian people.[19] In Turkey, it is \"a preferred offering at communal gatherings of all kinds\", according to Engin Akin.[18] In Armenia and Azerbaijan, it is, along with dolma, lavash, harissa, kebabs, and pahlava, a dish of \"clearly symbolic ethnic significance\" often argued over by gastronationalists attempting to claim it as one of their own country's traditional dishes that has been co-opted by the other country.[14] The basic Ingredient of koftas is usually meat, but they are known for their versatility. There are many different ways to prepare it, like frying, baking, steaming, boiling, or grilling.[20] In traditional preparation methods, kofta is kneaded with fine bulgur and meat, and in some middle eastern countries it is served with the raw meat in the kneaded form. With the inventive fillings that frequently enhance the flavor profile, koftas provide plenty of opportunity for creative culinary experimentation. Often added into the kofta mixture are nuts, cheese, or eggs.[21] Furthermore, koftas come in a broad range of shapes and sizes, from little oval shaped egg size balls to flatly carved rhombuses in trays, or tennis ball sized koftas. In addition to satisfying personal tastes, this variation in size and shape enables creative display and serving possibilities. Generally meat is mixed with spices and often other ingredients such as rice, bulgur, vegetables, or eggs to form a paste.[9] They can be grilled, fried, steamed, poached, baked, or marinated, and may be served with a rich spicy sauce or in a soup or stew.[9] Koftas are sometimes made from fish or vegetables or even cottage cheese  rather than red meat.[22] Some versions are stuffed with nuts, cheese, or eggs.[9] Generally the size can vary from the \"size of an orange to the size of a golf ball\",[23] although some variants are outside that range; tabriz k\u00f6ftesi, which average 20 centimetres (8\u00a0in) in diameter, are the largest.[9] They can be shaped in various forms[10] including patties, balls, or cylinders.[24] Some versions are uncooked.[12] The dictionary definition of kofta at Wiktionary",

    "Prawns": "Prawn is a common name for small aquatic crustaceans with an exoskeleton and ten legs (members of the order of decapods), some of which are edible.[1] The term prawn[2] is used particularly in the United Kingdom, Ireland, and Commonwealth nations, for large swimming crustaceans or shrimp, especially those with commercial significance in the fishing industry. Shrimp in this category often belong to the suborder Dendrobranchiata. In North America, the term is used less frequently, typically for freshwater shrimp. The terms shrimp and prawn themselves lack scientific standing. Over the years, the way they are used has changed, and in contemporary usage, the terms are almost interchangeable. The terms shrimp and prawn are common names, not scientific names. They are vernacular or colloquial terms, which lack the formal definition of scientific terms. They are not taxa, but are terms of convenience with little circumscriptional significance. There is no reason to avoid using the terms shrimp or prawn when convenient, but it is important not to confuse them with the names or relationships of actual taxa.[2] According to the crustacean taxonomist Tin-Yam Chan, \"The terms shrimp and prawn have no definite reference to any known taxonomic groups. Although the term shrimp is sometimes applied to smaller species, while prawn is more often used for larger forms, there is no clear distinction between both terms and their usage is often confused or even reverse in different countries or regions.\"[3] Writing in 1980, L. B. Holthuis noted that the terms prawn and shrimp were used inconsistently \"even within a single region\", generalising that larger species fished commercially were generally called shrimp in the United States, and prawns in other English-speaking countries, although not without exceptions.[4] A lot of confusion surrounds the scope of the term shrimp. Part of the confusion originates with the association of smallness. That creates problems with shrimp-like species that are not small. The expression \"jumbo shrimp\" can be viewed as an oxymoron, a problem that does not exist with the commercial designation \"jumbo prawns\".[5] The term shrimp originated around the 14th century with the Middle English shrimpe, akin to the Middle Low German schrempen, and meaning to contract or wrinkle; and the Old Norse skorpna, meaning to shrivel up, or skreppa, meaning a thin person.[6][7] It is not clear where the term prawn originated, but early forms of the word surfaced in England in the early 15th century as prayne, praine and prane.[8][9][10] According to the linguist Anatoly Liberman it is unclear how shrimp, in English, came to be associated with small. \"No Germanic language associates the shrimp with its size... The same holds for Romance... it remains unclear in what circumstances the name was applied to the crustacean.\"[11] Taxonomic studies in Europe on shrimp and prawns were shaped by the common shrimp and the common prawn, both found in huge numbers along the European coastlines. The common shrimp, Crangon crangon, was categorised in 1758 by Carl Linnaeus, and the common prawn, Palaemon serratus, was categorised in 1777 by Thomas Pennant. The common shrimp is a small burrowing species aligned with the notion of a shrimp as being something small, whereas the common prawn is much larger. The terms true shrimp or true prawn are sometimes used to mean what a particular person thinks is a shrimp or prawn.[2] This varies with the person using the terms. But such terms are not normally used in the scientific literature, because the terms shrimp and prawn themselves lack scientific standing. Over the years the way shrimp and prawn are used has changed, and nowadays the terms are almost interchangeable. Although from time to time some biologists declare that certain common names should be confined to specific taxa, the popular use of these names seems to continue unchanged.[2][12] The terms shrimp and prawn originated in Britain. In the use of common names for species, shrimp is applied to smaller species, particularly species that are dorsoventrally depressed (wider than deep) with a shorter rostrum. It is the only term used for species in the family Crangonidae, such as the common shrimp or brown shrimp, Crangon crangon. Prawn is never applied to very small species. It is applied to most of the larger forms, particularly species that are laterally compressed (deeper than wide) and have a long rostrum. However, the terms are not used consistently. For example, some authors refer to Pandalus montagui as an Aesop shrimp, while others refer to it as an Aesop prawn.[2][4] Commonwealth countries, and Ireland, tend to follow British usage. Some exceptions occur in Australia, where some authors refer to small species of the Palaemonidae as prawns and call the Alpheidae pistol shrimp. Other Australian authors have given the name banded coral shrimp to the prawn-like Stenopus hispidus and listed \"the Processidae and Atyidae as shrimps, the Hippolytidae, Alpheidae, Pandalidae and Campylonotoidea as prawns\".[4] New Zealand broadly follows British usage. A rule of thumb given by some New Zealand authors states: \"In common usage, shrimp are small, some three inches or less in length, taken for food by netting, usually from shallow water. Prawn are larger, up to 12 inches long, taken by trapping and trawling.\"[13] In Canada, the terms are often used interchangeably as in New Zealand (larger species are prawns, and smaller are often shrimp), but regional variations exist. In western provinces, prawn is almost exclusively the general term.  South Africa and the former British colonies in Asia also seem to follow British usage generally.[4] Shrimp is the more general term in the United States.[4] The term prawn is less commonly used in the United States, being applied mainly to larger shrimp and those living in freshwater.

    "Churra": "The Churra is an Iberian type, breed or group of breeds of sheep.[2]:\u200a920\u200a[3]:\u200a280\u200a[4]:\u200a107\u200a The word churra simply means 'coarse-woolled'. The Churra originates in the Duero Valley in the autonomous community  of Castile and Le\u00f3n in north-western Spain.[2]:\u200a920\u200a In the province of Zamora the milk is used to make Zamorano cheese.[5]:\u200a132 There are numerous regional variants of the Churra in Spain. Two of these are recognised as separate breeds: the Churra Lebrijana of Andalusia, also known as the Atlantica or Marisme\u00f1a, named for Lebrija on the Guadalquivir and found in the coastal provinces of Cadiz and Huelva in south-western Spain;[2]:\u200a741\u200a[3]:\u200a283\u200a[6] and the Churra Tensina, named for the Valle de Tena in the province of Huesca in the central Pyrenees.[2]:\u200a931\u200a[3]:\u200a287\u200a[7] Others include the small Sayaguesa, associated with the comarca of Sayago in the south of the province of Zamora and reared mostly for meat;[2]:\u200a906\u200a the Churra del Bierzo or Blanca del Bierzo, an endangered polled type from the comarca of El Bierzo in the province of Le\u00f3n; and the Churra Castellana or Churra Campera of Castile.[2]:\u200a920 The Churra is a traditional triple-purpose breed, reared for milk, for meat and for its wool, which is of coarse quality suitable for carpet-making.[2]:\u200a920\u200a Sheep of this type were taken by the conquistadores to the New World, where they gave rise to American breeds such as the Chiapas and the Navajo-Churro.[2]:\u200a920\u200a Cross-breeding with the Merino has given rise to the Spanish: entrefino or medium-fine group of breeds in Spain, and to the Churra Algarvia breed in Portugal.[2]:\u200a920\u200a Other Portuguese Churra breeds include the Churra Badana, the Churra Galega Bragan\u00e7ana Branca, the Churra Galega Bragan\u00e7ana Preta, the Churra Galega Mirandesa, the Churra Mondegueira, the Churra da Terra Quente, the Churra do Campo and the Churra do Minho.[8]  This sheep-related article is a stub.

    "Aappam": " An appa or hoppers is a type of thin pancake originating from South India and Sri Lanka. It is made with fermented rice batter and coconut milk, traditionally cooked in an appachatti, a deep pan similar in shape to a wok. It is part of  Tamil cuisine and Kerala cuisine found in the Indian states of Tamil Nadu and Kerala, and in Sri Lanka.[1]  Appam is most frequently served for breakfast or dinner, often with a topping such as an egg. Appa (also aapa, appe) may derive from the Sanskrit word (\u0905\u092a\u0942\u092a apupa), which refers to a type of \"fried dainty.\"[2] Vir Sanghvi, an Indian journalist, quotes food historian K. T. Achaya and states that the appam is mentioned in the Tamil Sangam literature, in works like Perump\u0101\u1e47\u0101\u1e5f\u1e5fuppa\u1e6dai.[3][4][5] Achaya states that appam was well-established in ancient Tamil country as mentioned in Sangam, with poems also describing appam along with modakam being sold at street markets in ancient city of Madurai.[6][7] \u201cAt nightfall, the sounds of conch shells cease, and shops are shut, their screens pulled down. Vendors, who sell delicate appams that are like honeycombs and modakam that are made by hand filled with coconut and sugar sweet and pulses, go to sleep.\" Appam is a close relative of dosa. Early dosas were made from rice batter and later black lentils were introduced, and since then black lentils have become an integral component of dosa.[3] The recipe of appam unlike dosa has remained unchanged for centuries.[3] One of the earliest recipes for appam can be found in the elaborately carved recipe on the walls of the Srirangam temple, made to be offered to the deity.[8][9] Appam also has a rich history in the island nation of Sri Lanka.[10] There are multiple styles of fermenting appam, and some Jewish historians have noted that the Cochin Jews of Kerala used fresh toddy instead of yeast.[11][12] Idiyappam (string hopper or noolputtu) is made from rice noodles curled into flat spirals. It is served for breakfast with a thin curry of fish or chicken, containing only one or two pieces of meat, a dhal (lentil) dish, and a spicy sambol or fresh chutney. Kiri hodi or sodhi, a type of coconut milk curry, is another popular accompaniment to idiyappam. String hoppers are made from steamed rice flour made into a dough with water and a little salt, and forced through a mould similar to those used for pasta to make the strings. They are cooked by steaming. Some people even sprinkle grated coconut on the rice noodles. These hoppers can be bought ready-made. In India and Sri Lanka, String Hoppers can be served as both a breakfast meal and as dinner. There are many variations to hoppers, depending on, for example, the type of flour used. This simple dish can be adapted into other foods such as string hopper biriyani, by adding scrambled eggs or vegetables.[13] Achappam is a deep-fried rose cookie made with rice. It is a signature Syrian Christian food.[14] Kuzhalappam is a typical Syrian Christian-Saint Thomas Christians dish which is a fried crisp curled up like a tube.[15][16] Neyyappam owes its origins to Kerala and has been a traditional offering in Hindu temples for God.[17] It is made with rice flour, jaggery and clarified butter ghee, which is the traditional method of making Nei appam. Again, the different culture and religious practices introduced variations to the dish as described in the citation above. Unni appam is a variation in which mashed plantain is added to the batter. The batter is made out of rice flour, jaggery and plantain and is poured into a vessel called appakarai or appakaram, which has ghee heated to a high temperature. The appams take the shape of small cups and are fried until deep brown. Kallappam is a traditional breakfast item of Kerala. It is made from fermented rice flour and coconut batter. Christians in Kerala prepare it on special occasions like Easter.[18] Its name is derived from kallu, Malayalam for palm toddy, the ingredient traditionally used for fermenting the rice flour. In modern preparation of the dish, yeast has replaced toddy.[19] Pesaha appam is made by Nasrani Christians in Kerala during Pesaha (Passover).  This type of appam is dipped in syrup or Pesaha Pal (Passover Coconut Milk) before being served.[20] Vattayappam is made from rice flour, sugar, and coconut. It is an oil-free tea-time snack in a majority of households in Kerala.[21] The dish is made by steam-cooking the batter and is very similar to the b\u00e1nh b\u00f2 from Vietnam. Appam, called apon (\u1021\u102c\u1015\u102f\u1036) in Burmese, is a common street food in Burmese cuisine.[22] It is considered a delicacy of Southern Myanmar, in coastal towns like Dawei and Myeik.[23][24] In Indonesia, a variant of appam is known as kue apem or kue apam. It is an Indonesian kue or traditional cake of steamed dough made of rice flour, coconut milk, yeast and palm sugar, usually served with grated coconut.[25] Indonesian households or community traditionally communally made kue apem for celebration and festivities. For example, Keraton Yogyakarta traditionally held Ngapem ceremony, where royal household communally cook kue apem (Javanese version of appam) as a part of Tingalan Jumenengan Dalem ceremony.[26] It is quite similar to kue mangkok. Just like kue putu it is derived from Indian influence on Indonesian cuisine.",
    "Aavakaaya": " A mango pickle is a variety of pickle prepared using mango.[1] It is very popular in South and Southeast Asia. These sour/spicy pickles are also available commercially. The pickling process in India differs from other regions mainly due to an additional spice mixture added to them after anaerobic fermentation.[citation needed] Pickles are main side dishes and many varieties of vegetables are used. However, raw mango or tender mango is the most popular variety of fruit used for pickling. There are multiple varieties of mango pickles prepared depending on the region and the spices used but broadly there are two types: whole baby mango pickles and cut mango pickle. Whole baby mango pickle is a traditional variety very popular in Southern India and uses baby mangoes that are few weeks old.[citation needed] There are special varieties of mangoes specifically used just for pickling and they are never consumed as ripe fruit. Baby mangoes are pickled using salt, vegetable oil and a blend of hot spices, in a very careful process which ensures pickles are preserved for years.[2] This is ideally prepared using a special variety of mango that can stay crisp for longer periods when pickled. This variety of mango is specially bred and grafted for use. However, most raw mango varieties  can be pickled if quality is not a concern.[citation needed] One of the most popular kind of mango pickles is called the \"Avakaya\"(\u0c06\u0c35\u0c15\u0c3e\u0c2f), also known as \"Uragaya\"(\u0c0a\u0c30\u0c17\u0c3e\u0c2f) and it is known for its spice and flavor. It is usually eaten with plain white rice or on the side with other flavored rice items like a hot sauce and is a staple of meals in southern India, especially in the state of Andhra Pradesh.[citation needed] Avakaya (also known as mango pickle[3]) is a variety of Indian pickle popular in South India with its origin in Delta Districts of Andhra Pradesh. The main ingredients are mangoes, \u0101vapi\u1e47\u1e0di (\u0c06\u0c35\u0c2a\u0c3f\u0c02\u0c21\u0c3f)(powdered mustard seeds) and a combination of other spices used for pickling. South Indians are known to have a deep attachment to these spicy pickles. A wide variety of pickles are available in these regions, using mango as their prime ingredient. Besides being made at home, the pickles are available commercially and are exported to the United States, Europe, Japan and many other countries.[4] Avakaya pickles are usually made in the summer, this being the time for peak availability of green mangoes. Green mangoes, hot oil, chilies and a variety of spices are the key ingredients. The process of preparation, storage and serving is considered almost a ritual.[citation needed] The mangoes are cut into medium-sized pieces approximately 2\u00a0cm x 2\u00a0cm using strong and especially sharp cutters/knives in swift strokes so as not to structurally damage the pieces. These pieces are wiped clean and dry with a highly-absorbent soft cloth\u00a0\u2014 usually an old sterilized cotton sari with no embroidery, stowed away for this purpose. They are then pickled with powdered mustard, red chili powder (dried and powdered or sometimes dried, roasted and powdered), salt, gingelly oil. The mixture matures for four to eight weeks, care being taken to mix the contents periodically to ensure a uniform marinade.[5] Hot rice is mixed with one or two pieces of avakaya and ghee (clarified butter) or groundnut oil, then made into bite-size balls. Avakaya is often eaten with rice and dahi (yogurt). Raw onion can be added  which enhances the taste. Most people prefer to eat it along with muddapappu (pigeon pea dal) and neyyi (ghee/clarified butter). Some people prefer to eat it within 1\u20132 months from preparation, when it is called Kott\u0101vak\u0101ya.[5] This is a variation where mangoes are grated to produce a chutney-like pickle. This is a variation of mango pickle. This kind of pickle is made from tender mango.[6] The small mangoes are collected when the mangoes just start to grow. In this pickle the mango is not cut into pieces; the whole mango is prepared as a form of pickle.",
    "Adhirasam": " Adhirasam (Tamil: \u0b85\u0ba4\u0bbf\u0bb0\u0b9a\u0bae\u0bcd), kajjaya or athrasa in Kannada (Kannada: \u0c85\u0ca4\u0ccd\u0cb0\u0cbe\u0cb8), ariselu in Telugu, anarasa in Marathi, Airsa in Chhattisgarhi or Arisa pitha in Odia) is a type of Indian sweet made out of \nrice, jaggery, ghee and sometimes coconut and with spices like cardamom, sesame, pepper and ginger powder from Tamil cuisine, Karnataka cuisine, Telugu cuisine, Marathi cuisine and Odia cuisine. The doughnut-like fried dough has a long history of popularity in Kannada, Telugu, Maharashtra, Chhattisgarh, Odisha, and Tamil civilization. They are similar in shape to vada, but are not savoury and are eaten as a sweet. Adhirasam is a popular as an offering to the relatives during Deepavali and Ganesha Chaturthi festivals, both at home and in temples in Tamil Nadu and Karnataka.[1][2] According to inscriptions from the 16th century during the reign of Vijayanagara emperor Krishnadevaraya, the sweet was made from rice flour, jaggery, butter and pepper.[3] At the annual festival at the Panchavarnesvar Temple in Thirunallur (located near Kumbakonam, Tamil Nadu), an offering of 6000 Adhirasams along with 6000 vadas is made to the Gods; the entire lot is cooked in the temple kitchen between sunrise and 11 pm, for the prayers that take place at midnight. It is a popular Deepavali sweet preparation for Tamil people.[4] The authentic preparation takes about a week. First the rice is soaked in water and dried in shade and ground into a fine powder when the rice is 3/4th dried and retains some moisture. For adding sweet \"vellam\" (jaggery in Tamil) is melted in water by boiling it till it reaches 'soft ball' consistency (235\u2013240\u00a0\u00b0F (113\u2013116\u00a0\u00b0C), if using a candy thermometer) and added to the rice flour along with some powdered cardamom to make a thick dough. It is then transferred to an earthenware pot and the top of the pot is closed with a thin white cloth. It is then allowed to ferment for about 3\u20135 days by placing it in the sunlight during the day time. Finally when the batter is ready for preparation, small balls of the dough is taken and flattened using fingers in a small piece of oil brushed banana leaf and deep fried in oil until golden brown. Then it is pressed with a flat bottomed bowl to remove the excess oil.[5] Media related to Adhirasam at Wikimedia Commons",

    "Ghevar": " Ghevar or Ghewar is a disc-shaped Rajasthani sweet[2] with a honeycomb-like texture, made from ghee, maida, and sugar syrup.[3] It is traditionally associated with the month of Shraavana and the festivals of Teej and Raksha Bandhan.[4][5] It is a part of Rajasthani tradition and is gifted to newly married daughter on Sinjara, the day preceding Gangaur and Teej.[6] It is also one of the Chhapan Bhog (56 dishes) served to the Lord Krishna.[7] Besides Rajasthan, it is also famous in the adjoining states of Haryana, Delhi, Gujarat, Uttar Pradesh, and Madhya Pradesh. Ghevar is savoured by masterchef Sanjeev Kapoor, too. Ghevar made its way into the coveted MasterChef Australia when Depinder Chhibber served the sweet in audition round of Season 13.[8] The word \"ghevar\" is connected to the Sanskrit term \"gh\u1e5btap\u016bra\" (\u0918\u0943\u0924\u092a\u0942\u0930), which breaks down into \"gh\u1e5bta\" (\u0918\u0943\u0924), meaning \"ghee\" (clarified butter), and \"p\u016bra\" (\u092a\u0942\u0930), meaning \"filled\" or \"cake.\" This term translates to \"ghee cake,\" reflecting the sweet's use of ghee and its cake-like texture. 16th century saint poet Mira Bai, offers Ghevar to Krishna in one of her poems.[9] The origin of Ghevar can be traced back to the royal courts of Rajasthan, where chefs crafted this delicacy for the Maharajas,[10] before eventually making its way to the common people of Rajasthan and India.[11] Ghevar is a disc-shaped sweet cake made with flour, ghee (clarified butter), and soaked in sugar syrup.[12][13] Flour, ghee, milk, and water are mixed to make a batter. The batter is then poured in ghee in disc shape and is fried to a golden honeycomb-like texture.[14]  Common toppings include saffron, spices and nuts.[15] Ghevar comes in multiple varieties, including plain, mawa, and malai ghevar.[16][17] Jaipur's LMB introduced variations like Chhena Ghevar in 1961. Ghevar can be soaked in sugar-water syrup or is often topped with rabdi.[15][18] A special variation for weight watchers and diabetics is its sugar free version available nowadays.",
    "Haleem": " Haleem is a type of stew that is widely consumed in South Asia, the Middle East and Central Asia. Although the dish varies from region to region, it optionally includes wheat or barley, meat and lentils. It is made by slow cooking the meat in lentils and spices. It is served hot with flat breads or on its own. The original Haleem, which is different from this variety, is an ancient Iranian dish served with wheat, meat, cinnamon, and sugar that remains popular in Iran. Popular variations of haleem include ke\u015fkek in Turkey, Tajikistan, Uzbekistan, Azerbaijan and northern Iraq; harisa in the Arab world and Armenia; halim in Afghanistan, Iran, West Bengal, in Mauritius, Pakistan and Bangladesh; and khichra in India.[2] Haleem is made of four main components: This dish is slow-cooked for seven to eight hours and then vigorously stirred or beaten with a pestle-like stirring stick. This results in a paste-like consistency, blending the flavors of spices, meat, barley, and wheat. In the end, the cooked haleem is garnished with fried onions, julienne-cut ginger, sliced green chillies, coriander leaves, lemon wedges, and chaat masala. However, haleem preparation varies in different regions.[citation needed] The origin of Haleem lies in the popular Arabian dish known as Harees (also written as Jareesh). According to Shoaib Daniyal, writing in The Sunday Guardian, the first written recipe of Harees dates back to the 10th century, when Arab scribe Abu Muhammad al-Muzaffar ibn Sayyar compiled a cookbook of dishes popular with the \"kings and caliphs and lords and leaders\" of Baghdad. \"The version described in his Kitab Al-Tabikh (Book of Recipes), the world's oldest surviving Arabic cookbook, is strikingly similar to the one people in the Middle East eat to this day\" it reported. The Harees was cooked as the Arab empire was extended to different parts of the world. Harees was introduced in the Indian subcontinent by the Arab soldiers of the Hyderabad Nizam's army to the city.[2][3][4][self-published source?] Today, Harees is still available in the Arab quarter of Hyderabad, an area called Barkas, where the dish is called Jareesh.[2] Later on, the people of Hyderabad modified it to suit their palate thus creating modern haleem.[3] Haleem is sold as a snack food in bazaars throughout the year. It is also a special dish prepared throughout the world during the Ramadan and Muharram months of the Muslim Hijri calendar, particularly among Pakistanis and Indian Muslims.[5][6] Since the name of this dish is the same of one of the names of Allah, specifically Al Haleem, some South Asian Muslims have started to refer to this dish as \"Daleem\", reasoning that it is more correct since the South Asian version of this dish contains large amounts of dal, or lentils.[1] It is mostly still referred to as Haleem. In India, haleem prepared in Hyderabad during the Ramadan month,[7] is transported all over the world through a special courier service. Haleem is traditionally cooked in large, wood-fired cauldrons.[8] Haleem is also very popular in Bangladesh, especially during the holy month of Ramadan, when it is a staple dish.[9][10] However, the Bangladeshi version of halim differs from other areas slightly as the meat and bones are stewed and kept as small pieces instead of mashing them with the lentil soup. In addition, the variety of spices used is also different. One common  Bangladeshi version of Halim is called \"Shahi Halim\"; it is mostly popular in the central part of the country. In Pakistan, Haleem is available all year round, as well as in most Pakistani restaurants around the world. Haleem is sold as a snack food and street food in Pakistani bazaars throughout the year.[11][12] It is a tradition among Persian Jews to eat haleem on Shabbat, since like other Shabbat stews such as cholent and hamin[13] it's a slow-cooked dish that can be prepared before the beginning of Shabbat and then cooked overnight at a low temperature.[14] Haleem has become a popular dish in the cities of Hyderabad, Telangana and Aurangabad, Maharashtra (Aurangabad, the first capital of Hyderabad State) in India. Originating from an Arabic dish called Harees,[1] Haleem was introduced to the region during the Mughal period by foreign migrants.[15] In 2010, Hyderabadi haleem was awarded Geographical Indication status by the Indian GI registry office. It became the first meat product of India to receive a GI certification.[16][17] This means that a dish cannot be sold as Hyderabadi haleem unless it meets the necessary standards laid down for it.[18] In the Indian subcontinent, both haleem and khichra are made with similar ingredients. In khichra, the chunks of meat remain as cubes, while in haleem the meat cubes are taken out of the pot, bones are removed, the meat is crushed and put back in the pot. It is further cooked until the meat completely blends with the lentils, wheat and barley mixture.[19] A high-calorie dish, haleem provides protein from the meat and fibre and carbohydrates from the various combinations of grains and pulses. Haleem can be served with chopped mint leaves, lemon juice, coriander leaves, fried onions, chopped ginger root or green chilies. In some regions of Pakistan, Haleem is eaten with Naan or with any type of bread or rice. In some parts of Uzbekistan it is served with sugar. Hot",

    "Hyderabadi Biryani": " Hyderabadi biryani (also known as Hyderabadi dum biryani) is a style of biryani originating from Hyderabad, India made with basmati rice and meat (mostly mutton). Originating in the kitchens of the Nizam of Hyderabad, it combines elements of Hyderabadi and Mughlai cuisines. Hyderabad biryani is a key dish in Hyderabadi cuisine and it is so famous that the dish is considered synonymous with the city of Hyderabad. Hyderabad was conquered by the Mughals in the 1630s, and ruled by its Nizams. Mughlai culinary traditions joined with local traditions to create Hyderabadi cuisine.[1] :\u200a92\u200a Local folklore attributes the creation of Hyderabadi biryani to the chef of the first Nizam, Nizam-ul-Mulk, Asaf Jah I, in the mid-18th century, during a hunting expedition.[2][3] In 1857, when the Mughal Empire declined in Delhi, Hyderabad emerged as the center of South Asian culture,[4][5] resulting in a mix of innovations in Hyderabadi biryani.[6][7]:\u200aviii\u200a [8] The exact origin of the dish is uncertain. Despite legends attributing it to the Nizam's chef, the biryani is of South Indian origin, derived from pilaf varieties brought to South Asia by Arab traders. Pulao may have been an army dish in medieval India. Armies would prepare a one-pot dish of rice with whichever meat was available. The distinction between \"pulao\" and \"biryani\" is arbitrary.[9][10] Hyderabadi biryani developed engrossing Deccani or Telangana flavors into it, as stated by the Himayat Ali Mirza, the great-grandson of Mir Osman Ali Khan. Himayat said that this evolution had taken place in the Asaf Jah\u2019s Kitchen.[11] Base ingredients are basmati rice, goat meat or (sometime chicken or beef), dahi, fried onion and ghee. Spices include cinnamon, cloves, cardamom (elaichi), bay leaves, nutmeg, papaya paste, caraway (shahi jeera), mace flower (javitri), star anise (biryani flower), lemon, and saffron.[3] Hyderabadi biryani is of two types: the kachchi (raw) biryani, and the pakki (cooked) biryani.[12] The kachchi biryani is prepared with kachchi gosht (raw meat) marinated with spices overnight and then soaked in curd (dahi) before cooking. The meat is sandwiched between layers of fragrant basmati rice and cooked \"in dum\" after sealing the handi (vessel) with dough. This is a challenging process as it requires meticulous attention to time and temperature to avoid over- or under-cooking the meat.[13][14] A biryani is usually served with dahi chutney and mirchi ka salan.[15] Baghaar-e-baingan is a common side dish. The salad includes onion, carrot, cucumber, and lemon wedges.",
    "Jangiri": " Imarti is a sweet from India.[1] It is made by deep-frying vigna mungo flour (urad dal flour) batter in a circular flower shape, then soaking in sugar syrup. Alternative names include Amitti, Amriti, Emarti, Omritti, Jahangir and Jhangiri/Jaangiri. This dish is not to be confused with jalebi, which is thinner and sweeter than Imarti.[2] Amitti is a popular Iftar item in Bangladesh.[3] It is a specialty of Sylheti desserts for Iftari that is made without any food color.[4] Beniram's in Jaunpur is the oldest surviving shop selling imarti.[1] Amriti or Jangri is made from varieties of black gram flour, also colloquially called urad dal in North India, jangiri parappu (lentils) or jangiri black gram in, Karnataka, Tamilnadu, Andhra Pradesh, Telangana and other parts of the Indian subcontinent. Saffron is added for colour. Black gram is soaked in water a for few hours, and stone-ground into a fine batter. The batter is poured into ghee, though other oils are sometimes used. Like funnel cakes, the batter is poured into geometric patterns, although amriti are generally smaller than funnel cakes. There is often a small ring in the middle. Before frying the batter, sugar syrup is prepared and is flavored with edible camphor, cloves, cardamom, kewra and saffron. The fried material is then dipped in sugar syrup until it expands in size and soaks up a significant amount of the syrup. In Northern India, imartis are drained, so tend to be drier than jalebis. The pieces can be served hot, at room temperature, or refrigerated. In India, this sweet is served during the meal and also popular at weddings and festivals. In particular, Jaunpur in Uttar Pradesh is famous for its imarti.[5] It is also used with dahi. Imarti is also popularly known as \"Jangri\" in south India, same thing but different names",
    "Kadhi": " Kadhi or karhi is a yogurt-based dish originating from Rajasthan, india.[2] It's made by simmering yogurt with besan (gram flour) and indian spices until it forms a thick, tangy gravy. Sometimes, it's also mixed with pakoras (deep-fried fritters). It is often eaten with cooked rice or roti.[3] The word Kadhi is derived from the Sanskrit root kvathita (\u0915\u094d\u0935\u0925\u093f\u0924)[4] which refers to a decoction or a gruel of curcuma, asafoetida and buttermilk. In Sanskrit literature, Kadhi has been referred to with the name kvathika (\u0915\u094d\u0935\u0925\u093f\u0915\u093e).[5] The kadhi is believed to be originated in the arid landscapes of Rajasthan, where cooks incorporated dairy products to compensate for the limited availability of vegetables.[6][7] Although Punjabis may have a strong association with kadhi-chawal, its origins trace back to Rajasthan, according to Celebrity Chef Kunal Kapur. Historically, kadhi was first crafted in Rajasthan before spreading to Gujarat and Sindh regions. Chef Kunal elaborates that kadhi was traditionally concocted when households had surplus milk, which was churned into butter, leaving behind buttermilk (chaas) to be used in preparing kadhi.[8] Kadhi is generally considered a staple everyday food in many parts of India[9] and is thought to aid in digestion.[10] In Gujarat and Rajasthan, it is usually served with khichdi, roti, paratha, or rice. Gujarati and Rajasthani kadhi differ from the Uttar Pradesh variety. Gujarati kadhi is a little sweeter than the other variants because sugar or jaggery is added to it, but it can be made without sugar for a more sour taste. It is eaten without pakoras, and its consistency is slightly thinner. Gujarati kadhi may be made from buttermilk, which gives it a smoother texture compared to yogurt. Variations of this basic dish include the addition of certain vegetables, notably bhindi (okra); kadhi containing okra is known as bhinda ni kadhi. In Punjab, kadhi is a simple and quick winter meal. Unlike the rest of India, yogurt may or may not be added \u2014 full-fat buttermilk may be used instead, although some households still prefer to use yogurt. Depending on the region, kadhi is commonly tempered with red chili peppers, cumin, coriander seeds, asafoetida, and fenugreek seeds.[10] In Western India, especially in coastal Maharashtra and in the Konkan region, kadhi is made with kokum, creating a variant called solkadhi. Other variants of kadhi in Maharashtra are made with kacchi kairi (raw mango), which is known as aambyachi kadhi (raw mango kadhi). Another variant of kadhi in Maharashtra is made with curd and buttermilk; this is known as takachi kadhi. In Haryana, a popular variation is called haryanvi hara choley kadhi, made with besan and hare choley (raw green chickpeas) plus pure ghee, which is added during serving. Haryanvi kadhi is sometimes cooked with additional ingredients, such as seasonal farm-fresh green bathua leaves or kachri, a kind of small, wild melon. In Purvanchal (eastern Uttar Pradesh) and Bihar, it is called kadhi-badi because of the addition of pakoras, small badi (or vadi) made out of chickpea flour, with no vegetables added (unlike standard pakora). The name kadhi is also derived from several Indo-Aryan languages spoken in northern India, in which \u0915\u093e\u0922\u093c\u0928\u093e kadhna means 'to take out,' which, in this context, means to reduce, so the yogurt and chickpea curry is cooked for a very long time until it is reduced and the consistency changes from runny to thick and creamy. In Southern states, it is seasoned with sauteed asafoetida, mustard seeds, cumin, and fenugreek. The soup is thickened in a different way by the addition of pureed split chickpeas soaked overnight with whole coriander seeds and dry red chili pepper. Squash, okra, tomato, Chinese spinach, carrots, and sweet peas are some of the vegetables that are added to the seasoning before bringing the soup to a boil. Pakoras (gram flour fritters) are added for special occasions like ceremonies. It is called majjige huli in Kannada, majjiga pulusu in Telugu, and mor kuzhambu in Tamil; all of these names have similar meanings. In Kerala, it is called kaalan. The Sindhi diaspora in India usually make kadhi by roasting the chickpea flour and adding vegetables to the chickpea gravy. It is called kadhi because of the use of curry leaves, which are called kadhi patta in Sindhi. Instead of yogurt, tamarind pulp is used to give it a sour taste. An alternate method is to make a liquid mixture of chickpea flour instead of roasting chickpeas. In Pakistan, kadhi is usually served with steamed rice and naan. Thari people commonly refer to kadhi as raabro or khaatiyo. In Northern Pakistan, in and around the Hazara region of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa province, kadhi can be prepared with a variety of additives such as chicken, pumpkin, and sarson ka saag. In Karachi and Hyderabad, Sindh, in addition to plain kadhi, a variety of vegetables such as okra, aubergine, and drumstick beans may be added. In Pakistan, kadhi is generally understood to always include fritters.  Hot or Warm",
    "Kalakand": " Kalakand is a sweet cheese confection from India.[1] It has been described as \"akin to Italian cheesecake, firmer in texture than milk cake, but softer than burfis.\"[2] Kalakand was invented in 1947 by the halwai (confectioner) Baba Thakur Das & Sons in Alwar, Rajasthan after Das emigrated from Pakistan following the Partition of India.[3][4][5] To make kalakand, chhena (Indian cheese) is prepared and strained. Separately, whole milk and water are mixed, boiled, and stirred continuously until the mixture is reduced to half its original volume. The strained chhena is softened using a food processor or by hand kneading. It is then added to the reduced milk-water mixture and cooked until it becomes a thick paste. Then sugar is added, and the mixture is cooked on low heat and stirred continuously until it thickens to a fudge-like consistency. Then ghee (clarified butter) or butter is added, and the mixture is cooked and stirred another five minutes until it acquires a glossy appearance. The mixture is spread onto a buttered tray or platter in the form of a rectangle and garnished with pistachios. After cooling, it is cut into squares and served.[1]",
    "Nihari": " Nihari (Hindi: \u0928\u093f\u0939\u093e\u0930\u0940; Bengali: \u09a8\u09bf\u09b9\u09be\u09b0\u09c0; Urdu: \u0646\u06c1\u0627\u0631\u06cc) is a stew originating in Lucknow, the capital of 18th-century Awadh under the Mughal Empire in the Indian subcontinent. It consists of slow-cooked meat, mainly a shank cut of beef, lamb and mutton, or goat meat, as well as chicken and bone marrow. It is flavoured with long pepper (pippali), a relative of black pepper. In Pakistan and Bangladesh, nihari is often served and consumed with naan. The name nihari originates from Arabic nah\u00e2r (\u0646\u0647\u0627\u0631), meaning \"morning\";[2][3][4] it was originally eaten by nawabs in the Mughal Empire as a breakfast course following Fajr prayer.[2][4] According to many sources, nihari originated in the royal kitchens of Lucknow, Awadh (modern-day Uttar Pradesh, India), in the late 18th century, during the last throes of the Mughal Empire.[3] It was originally meant to be consumed as a heavy, high-energy breakfast dish on an empty stomach by working-class citizens, particularly in colder climates and seasons. However, the dish later gained a significant amount of popularity and eventually became a staple of the royal cuisine of Mughal-era nawabs.[5][6] Nihari is a traditional dish among the Indian Muslim communities of Lucknow, Delhi, and Bhopal. Following the partition of India in 1947, many Urdu-speaking Muslims from northern India migrated to Karachi in West Pakistan and Dhaka in East Pakistan, and established a number of restaurants serving the dish. In Karachi, nihari became a large-scale success[7] and soon spread in prominence and availability across Pakistan. In some restaurants, a few kilograms from each day's leftover nihari is added to the next day's pot; this reused portion of the dish is known as taar and is believed to provide a unique flavour. Some nihari outlets in Old Delhi claim to have kept an unbroken cycle of taar going for more than a century.[8] Nihari is also used as a home remedy for fever, rhinorrhea, and the common cold.[9] Hot",

The word Pakha\u1e37a was used in the Odia poems of Arjuna Das in his literary work K\u00e5\u1e37p\u00e5l\u00e5t\u0101 (Odia: \u0b15\u0b33\u0b4d\u0b2a\u0b32\u0b24\u0b3e) during 1520-1530 CE.[5] The different types of Pakhala classified as per preparation:[6][7][8] The dish is typically prepared with rice that is cooked and allowed to cool. Cook normal rice, then cool it. Pour water in a bowl and add rice to it. In a pan, heat a pinch of oil, add mustard seeds, curry leaves, dry red chili and fry well. Add this chhunka or tadka into the pakhala bowl with sour curd. One can add mint leaves and raw salt to enhance the taste. To add more zing, one may opt for fish fry or sukhua poda (dry fish fried), saga bhaja, badi chura (a regional food item made up of batter of urad or black gram by drying under sunshine as small nuts and then fried to serve) and much more. Cumin seeds are fried, ground into a fine powder and added to curd with coriander leaves and salt.It is sometimes served with a fish fry and spinach.[11] Pakha\u1e37a is slightly fermented rice. The rice is cooked, water is added with little bit of old pakhal (something similar to making curd using milk and old curd). Pakha\u1e37a tastes best when served after 8 to 12 hours after preparation; in this case, no old pakhal is required to be added to the rice as fermentation usually happens after 6 hours of keeping rice in water. The Pakhala by itself tastes a bit sour, but also paste of green chilli, green Mango and ginger is added to give the Pakhala a little bit hot and sweet flavour. Generally burnt potato or alu poda (boiled is also used) and other fried vegetables or fried fish is served with pakha\u1e37a. Various side dishes include dahi baigana, kakharu phula bhaja (fried pumpkin flowers), mashed potatoes (alu bharata), fried fish (macha bhaja), fried prawns (chingudi bhaja), sukhua (dried fish) and saga bhaja (fired leafy vegetables).[6][4] To promote the cuisine in modern era, Pakhala Dibasa was declared on 20 March 2011 by popular initiative to be celebrated by Odias worldwide.[12] Thus 20 March is celebrated every year as Pakhala Dibas (Pakhala Day) by Odias across the regions[13][14][15] where people eat and promote the cuisine.[16][17] As most of the Odia outside of Odisha live in Europe and in the Northern American regions, the weather in March is not suitable for cold-Pakhal. Therefore, the International-Pakhal-Dibasa is celebrated on July 13. Hot (Saja Pakhala) and cold",

Pithas are typically made of rice flour, although there are some types of pitha made of wheat flour. Less common types of pitha are made of palm or ol (a local root vegetable). Pithas are primarily made from a batter of rice flour or wheat flour, which is shaped and optionally filled with sweet or savory ingredients. When filled, the pitha's pouch is called a khol (literally \"container\") and the fillings are called pur. For stuffed vegetable pithas, ingredients such as cauliflower, cabbage, radish, or potato are usually fried, baked, or steamed, and then mashed, cooled, and formed into small balls to stuff into the pithas. Sweet pithas typically contain sugar, jaggery, date juice, or palm syrup, and can be filled with grated coconut, fried or roasted sesame seeds, cashews, pistachios, sweetened vegetables, or fruits.

    "Pootharekulu": " Pootharekulu (plural) or poothareku (singular) is a popular Indian sweet from the Andhra Pradesh state of south India.[1] The sweet is wrapped in a wafer-thin rice starch layer resembling paper and is stuffed with sugar, dry fruits and nuts. The sweet is popular for festivals, religious occasions and weddings in the Telugu states. The name of the sweet literally means 'coated sheet' in the Telugu language\u2014pootha means 'coating' and reku (plural rekulu) means 'sheet' in Telugu. The making of pootharekulu is a cottage industry in Atreyapuram, where around 400 families are dependent on the making and marketing of the sweet. As of October 2018,[update] the state of Andhra Pradesh was said to be in the process of applying for Geographic Indication (GI) tag for the sweet.[2] Pootharekulu were created in Atreyapuram, a village and mandal headquarters in the East Godavari district of Andhra Pradesh.[3] The sweet has a history of a few centuries (three centuries by some accounts).[4] It is said that a village woman first prepared the sweet by adding sugar and ghee to leftover rice starch.[1][2] Atreyapuram villagers soon started making wrappers from rice flour, put sugar and ghee inside and folded them. They supplied the sweets to candy manufacturers all over the two Telugu states. Normally, women make pootharekulu in their free time while men are engaged in the marketing of the sweet. The annual turnover of the cottage industry is estimated to be Rs. 3 crore in 2016.[4] In August 2018, a group of cooks from East Godavari prepared a 10.5-meter long poothareku, as part of an attempt by the Andhra Pradesh tourism department to popularize Andhra cuisine.[5] Pootharekulu is made from a particular kind of rice batter called jaya biyyam ('biyyam' meaning rice), combined with powdered sugar and ghee (clarified butter). To make the edible film, a hot pot is prepared. To make the pot suitable, a hole is made in it, and to smoothen the surface for three days, the pot is alternately heated and wiped with a cloth dipped in oil. To make the films, coarse rice is ground for nearly two hours and made into a batter. This batter is then diluted; a thin cloth is dipped in the solution and put on the inverted pot with flame under it. The edible film forms on the pot instantly.[3] The edible film is then wrapped with sugar and/or jaggery and coated with ghee. Pootharekulu can be stuffed with different fillings, including fine powdered sugar, jaggery, dry fruits, and chocolate powder.  Hot and spicy pootharekulu are a relatively new variant.

Flattening the chhena into palm-sized patties is done in order to allow them to absorb the milk more readily. The thickened milk is also usually lightly seasoned with crushed cardamoms.[4]  This Indian cuisine\u2013related article is a stub. You can help Wikipedia by expanding it.",
    "Sondesh": "Sandesh (Bengali: \u09b8\u09a8\u09cd\u09a6\u09c7\u09b6 Sh\u00f4ndesh) is a dessert, originating from the Bengal region in the eastern part of the Indian subcontinent, created with milk and sugar.[1] Some recipes of sandesh call for the use of chhena or paneer (which is made by curdling the milk and separating the whey from it) instead of milk itself.[2] Some people in the region of Dhaka make a variety of sandesh called pranahara (literally 'heart stealer') which is softer and made with mawa and yogurt.[3] The Gupo/Gufo style of sandesh from Guptipara is considered by some to be the \"first branded sweet of Bengal\".[4] A sweet dish by the name sandesh is mentioned in medieval Bengali literature, including Krittibas' Ramayana and lyrics of Chaitanya Mahaprabhu. However, the ingredients of this original dish are not known.[5] This dish was most likely made of solidified kheer, thus being different from the modern chhena-based sandesh.[6][7] It is hard to determine when exactly sandesh started referring mainly to the chhena-based sweet instead of the kheer-based sweet. However, it is known that by the second half of the 19th century, sandesh commonly referred to the chhena-based sweet.[8] Sandesh can be made with the use of chhena or paneer. The simplest kind of sandesh in Bengal is the makha sandesh (makha, meaning 'kneaded'). It is prepared by tossing the chhena lightly with sugar over low heat. When shaped into balls, it is called Kanchagolla (kancha, meaning 'raw' and golla, meaning 'ball'). For more complex and elaborately prepared sandesh, the chhena is dried and pressed, flavored with fruit, and sometimes even colored, and cooked to many different consistencies. Sometimes it is filled with syrup, blended with coconut or kheer, and molded into a variety of shapes such as conch shells, elephants, and fish. Another variant is nolen gurer sandesh, which is made with gur or jaggery. It is known for its brown or caramel colour that comes from nolen gur.",

The sweet panjiri evolved from an Ayurvedic preparation called Panchaj\u012braka.[2] The term panj\u012br\u012b is derived from Sanskrit word panchaj\u012braka[10] which is an Ayurvedic preparation. The term panchaj\u012braka is ultimately from Sanskrit elements panch (five) and j\u012braka (cumin or herbal ingredients here).[11] Panjiri is prepared by roasting wheat flour in ghee and adding dry fruits and spices like jeera (cumin), dhaniya (coriander), saunth (dry ginger powder), saunf (fennel) etc. Alternatively, the term panjeri is also used in Rajasthani dialects.[12]Similarly, term pa\u00f1jar\u012b is used in Marathi and Gujarati languages. As per The Molesworth Marathi and English Dictionary, Pa\u00f1jar\u012b is sweetmeat composed of five ingredients, viz. ginger, coriander, \u014d\u1e43v\u0101 or Ajwaen, pepper (or cocoanut), and sugar.

The wheat flour panjiri is replaced with Dhaniya Panjiri because consuming grains is generally not allowed during fasting, hence this dish is prepared with the powder of coriander seeds, ghee, sugar, almonds and raisins.[25] This special variant of Panjiri is associated with Pushtimarg Sampradaya of Vaishnavism. Panjiri forms one of the 56 dishes of the Chhapan Bhog for Bhagwan Shrinathji, form of Bhagwan Krishna. This Panjiri is prepared as a Naivedhya for Shrinathji. The main ingredients used include\u00a0: Variyali (fennel), Ajmo (carom), Dhanna (coriander), sunthi (dry ginger), pepper flakes and gari (dry coconut).[26] In Jammu region, a special variation of Panjiri is prepared for winter season & Janamashtami Vrat and is called Sund Panjiri.

Papadam is typically served as an accompaniment to a meal in India, Pakistan, Bangladesh, Nepal, Sri Lanka and the Caribbean or as an appetizer, often with a dip such as chutneys, or toppings such as chopped onions and chili peppers, or it may be used as an ingredient in curries. Papadam is a loanword from Tamil \u0baa\u0baa\u0bcd\u0baa\u0b9f\u0bae\u0bcd pappa\u1e6dam,[1][2] and is likely derived from the Sanskrit word parpa\u1e6da (\u092a\u0930\u094d\u092a\u091f), meaning a flattened disc described in early Jain and Buddhist literature.[3][4] Papad is known by several names in the various languages of India, e.g. appadam (\u0c05\u0c2a\u0c4d\u0c2a\u0c21\u0c02) in Telugu; appalam (\u0b85\u0baa\u0bcd\u0baa\u0bb3\u0bae\u0bcd) or pappa\u1e6dam (\u0baa\u0baa\u0bcd\u0baa\u0b9f\u0bae\u0bcd) in Tamil; happala in Kannada; papadam (\u0db4\u0db4\u0da9\u0db8\u0dca) in Sinhala; pappadam in Malayalam; papad in Marathi,[5] Punjabi and Gujarati; and pampad (\u0b2a\u0b3e\u0b2e\u0b4d\u0b2a\u0b21) in Odia.[citation needed] Papad recipes vary from region to region and from household to household. They are typically made from a flour or paste derived from lentils, chickpeas, black gram, rice, or potatoes.[6] Salt and peanut oil are added to make a dough, which can be flavored with seasonings such as chili, cumin, garlic, or black pepper. Sometimes, baking soda or slaked lime are also added. The dough is shaped into thin, round flatbreads, dried (traditionally in the sun[7]), and can be cooked by deep frying, roasting over an open flame, toasting, or microwaving, depending on the desired texture. In most Indian restaurants around the world, they are served as an appetizer with dips, which often include mango chutney, lime pickle, onion chutney, and raita.[8] Masala papad with sev, onion, tomato and coriander leaves is one of India's most popular appetizers. Papadam can be prepared from different ingredients and methods. One popular recipe uses flour ground from hulled split black gram[9] mixed with black pepper, salt, a small amount of vegetable oil and a food-grade alkali, and the mixture is kneaded. A well-kneaded dough is then flattened into very thin rounds and then dried and stored for later preparation and consumption. It may also contain rice, jackfruit, sago, etc., as main ingredients. Cracked black pepper, red chili powder, asafoetida, cumin or sesame seeds are often used as flavoring agents. Papadam is also made from rice flakes, ragi or horsegram.[10]",

Vijayanagar records indicate that Pheni was another much relished sweet dish prepared from wheat flour and sugar, similar to phenaka of North India and had varieties like sugar pheni, milk pheni and vermicelli pheni[1][2][3]",
    "thalipeeth": " Thalipeeth is a savoury multi-grain flatbread popular in Western India, particularly in the state of Maharashtra. The flour for thalipeeth, called bhajanee, is prepared from roasted grains, legumes and spices. The ingredients include grains such as rice,[1] wheat, bajra, and jowar; legumes such as  chana, and urad; and spices, most commonly coriander and cumin seeds.[2] When preparing the dough, other ingredients such as onion, fresh coriander, other vegetables and spices are added.[3] Thalipeeth is usually served with butter (preferably made from water buffalo milk), ghee, or yogurt. The dish is popular in Maharashtra, Telangana and North Karnataka. (All 3 regions were previously part of Hyderabad State) In a variation from bhajanee,[4] flour made from tapioca (sabudana) and rajgira (amaranth) is used to make a thalipeeth on Hindu fasting days.

    "surnoli": "Surnoli is a sweet Indian pancake popular among the Konkani community. This is known to be a Saraswat Brahmin dish. Surnolis have a puffy texture with holes, with a yellow color and are usually made about 10\u00a0inches in diameter. Surnolis are traditionally eaten for breakfast or afternoon tea, served with homemade butter. Surnoli batter is made by grinding together soaked rice mixed with poha, coconut, buttermilk, jaggery and turmeric into a smooth paste. The batter is fermented overnight and cooked covered on a griddle on one side.",
    "Bal Mithai": " Bal mithai  (Kumaoni: \u092c\u093e\u0932 \u092e\u093f\u0920\u093e\u0908, B\u0101l Mithai) is a brown chocolate-like fudge, made with roasted khoya and coated with white balls made of sugar coated roasted poppy seeds. It is a popular sweet from Kumaon, India. Bal mithai originated in Kumaon. It was an invention of locals of Lal Bazaar, Almora, in the early twentieth century.[1] Scholars believe that bal mithai initially must have been the name of the prime offering to the Sun God.[1] Bal Mithai is made by cooking khoya (evaporated milk cream) with cane sugar until it becomes dark brown in color, colloquially called 'chocolate' for its color resemblance. This is allowed to settle and cool, and cut into cubes which are then coated with small white balls made of sugar coated roasted poppy seeds.[2] Bal mithai has long been a specialty of the Almora district[3] and neighbouring districts of Kumaon, along with singhauri, another preparation of flavoured khoya that comes wrapped in oak leaves. There has been a recent move to make local sweet makers aware of intellectual property rights, and Geographical Indications Protection (GI Protection) under the Geographical Indications of Goods Act of 1999, which would allow them to gain protection for local specialties such as bal mithai and singhauri, which are symbolic to Kumaon.[4]",
    "Basundi": " Basundi (Gujarati: \u0aac\u0abe\u0ab8\u0ac1\u0a82\u0aa6\u0ac0, Kannada: \u0cac\u0cbe\u0cb8\u0cc1\u0c82\u0ca6\u0cbf, Marathi: \u092c\u093e\u0938\u0941\u0902\u0926\u0940, Tamil: \u0baa\u0bbe\u0b9a\u0ba8\u0bcd\u0ba4\u0bbf, Telugu: \u0c2c\u0c3e\u0c38\u0c41\u0c02\u0c26\u0c3f) is an Indian sweet mostly in Maharashtra, Gujarat, Andhra Pradesh, Telangana, Tamil Nadu and Karnataka. It is a sweetened condensed milk made by boiling milk on low heat until the milk is reduced by half. In North India, a similar dish goes by the name rabri. It is often made on Hindu festivals such as Kali Chaudas and Bhaubeej (Bhai Dooj). Different styles of basundi are also prepared, such as sitaphal (custard apple) basundi and angoor basundi (basundi with smaller kinds of rasgullas). Heavy cream may be added during the boiling process to hasten the thickening process. Once reduced, a little sugar, cardamom, charoli, and/or saffron are added. Basundi is preserved well after sugar is added. Sugar develops some acidity over a period of time. If it is excessive, then it can curdle the basundi. Sometimes after adding sugar, one cooks it for some more time; this gives a nice pink color to basundi, as sugar is also cooked in milk turning into a light caramel. Before adding sugar, basundi is thick, but after adding, it becomes fluid again. Stirring well prevents malai from being formed on top and all guests (even late comers) can enjoy equally thick and plain basundi. Basundi is served chilled, often garnished with slices of almonds and pistachios.[1] [2] [3] The addition of condensed milk gives a nice flavour and richness to basundi.[4] Basundi can be served hot, warm or chilled. It is often served with puris (fried Indian flatbread). This milk that is flavored with cardamom powder and saffron basundi varies as per the quantity of saffron. Add less for mild colour.[5] The addition of condensed milk gives a nice flavour and wealth to basundi.[6] Narsobawadi Basundi is a variant from Narsobawadi, Maharashtra. It is a sweetened dense milk made by boiling milk on low heat until the milk is reduced.[8][9][10][11]",
    "Bhurta": " Bhurta, vorta, bhorta, bharta or chokha[1] is a lightly fried mixture of mashed vegetables (chakata) in the cuisine of the Indian subcontinent.[2] Some variations of this dish are baingan bhurta and aloo bhurta. The word Bhurta is derived from the Sanskrit roots bh\u1e5bj (\u092d\u0943\u091c\u094d) and bh\u1e5bkta (\u092d\u0943\u0915\u094d\u0924)[3] which mean something which is roasted or fried.

    "Bombay Duck": " Harpadon nehereus (common names include Bombay duck, bummalo, bombil, bombili, boomla, bumla, lote, loitta) is a species of lizardfish. Adults may reach a maximum length of 40\u00a0cm (16\u00a0in), but the usual size is around 25\u00a0cm (10\u00a0in).[2] In the early days [when?], Bombay Duck caught in Bombay (now Mumbai) used to be discarded. However, this fish was considered a delicacy in Bengal. When the railways began their journey in India, this fish was transported from Bombay to Calcutta. Since they used to get transported in a mail train, the fish got its name Bombay Mail fish (shortened to Bombail or Bombil) or Bombay Daak (Daak is mail in Bengali) [citation needed]. Some claim that this name was given by a British official (perhaps Robert Clive, mentioned later) who hated the overpowering smell of the fish in the train. \nAccording to local Bangladeshi stories,[citation needed] the term Bombay duck was first coined by Robert Clive, after he tasted a piece during his conquest of Bengal. He is said to have associated the pungent smell with that of the newspapers and mail which would come into the cantonments from Bombay. The term was later popularised among the British public by its appearance in Indian restaurants in the UK. In his 1829 book of poems and \"Indian reminiscences\", Sir Toby Rendrag (pseudonym) notes the \"use of a fish nick-named 'Bombay Duck'\"[3] and the phrase is used in texts as early as 1815.[4] The Bombay duck lives in the tropical areas of the Indo-Pacific. The fish is also known as \"strange fish\"[citation needed] because of its discontinuous distribution along the Indian coast. It has been traditionally caught in the waters off Maharashtra, Gujarat in the Lakshadweep Sea, where it is an important item of the yearly catch. This fish is also caught in the Bay of Bengal and in the South China Sea, although in smaller numbers.[5] The fish is sometimes dried, as well as dried and salted before it is consumed. After drying, the odour of the fish is extremely powerful, and it is usually transported in air-tight containers. The Bombay duck is a popular food item in certain areas of India particularly in Maharashtra. It is consumed as a dried fish in Sri Lanka, either tempered, fried or cooked as a curry. Fresh fish are usually fried as bombay duck fry, or cooked in curry.[citation needed] At one time,[when?] 13 tonnes (13 long tons; 14 short tons) of Bombay duck were eaten in the UK each year. Following the discovery of a batch of imported seafood contaminated by Salmonella in 1996, the European Commission (EC) prohibited fish imports from India other than from approved freezing and canning factories. As Bombay duck is not produced in a factory, this had the unintended consequence of banning the import of Bombay duck. After a campaign to \"Save Bombay Duck\", the Indian High Commission approached the EC about the ban, and the EC adjusted its regulations so that the fish can still be dried in the open air, but has to be packed in an \"EC approved\" packing station. A Birmingham wholesale merchant located a packing source in Mumbai, and the product became available again.[6][7]\nBombay duck is available fresh in Canada in cities with large Indian populations, such as Toronto and Montreal, and is generally known as bumla. Although mainly popular with Indians from Bengal, southern Gujarat, coastal Maharashtra, Goa, and Karnataka, it is increasingly consumed by the other South Asian populations, Sri Lankans, Bangladeshis and Burmese in particular. Bombay ducks are also consumed as a savoury dish in Mauritius; it is locally known as bomli.",
    "Chhena Gaja": "Chhena gaja (Odia: \u0b1b\u0b47\u0b28\u0b3e \u0b17\u0b1c\u0b3e) is a sweet dish from Balasore,Odisha,India.[1] Unlike some other popular chhena-based Odia desserts, such as rasagola, which have spread throughout India, the chhena gaja remains largely popular within the state itself. Although the ingredients of chhena gaja are essentially the same as that of rasagola and chhena poda, the dishes are very different in taste. One of the best places to savor chhena gajas is Pahala, near Bhubaneswar.[2] However, chhena gaja is equally popular all over Odisha. Chhena gajas are prepared by combining chhena, similar to cottage cheese, and sooji (semolina), and kneading the dough thoroughly. Water is squeezed out from the mixture, which is then dried briefly until it acquires the right consistency. It is then molded into palm-sized rectangular shapes (gajas), boiled in thick sugar syrup. Sometimes, the gajas are then allowed to dry a little more, in which case the sugar may occasionally crystallize on the surface.",
    "Dum Pukht": "Dum pukht (Persian: \u062f\u064e\u0645\u200c \u067e\u062e\u062a), larhmeen, dampokhtak, or slow oven cooking is a cooking technique associated with the Mughal Empire in which meat and vegetables are cooked over a low flame, generally in dough-sealed containers.[1] Traditions assign its origin in pre-partition India to the reign of Nawab of Awadh Asaf-ud-Daulah (1748\u201397).[2] The technique is now commonly used in other cuisines such as South Asian, Central Asian, and West Asian.[1] The term etymologically derives from Persian. Dum means 'to keep food on slow fire' and pukht means 'process of cooking', thus meaning 'cooking on slow fire'.[3] The method often requires cooking times up to 24 hours.[4][5] Dum pukht cooking uses a round, heavy-bottomed pot, preferably a handi (clay pot), in which food is sealed and cooked over a slow fire. The two main aspects of this style of cooking are bhunao and dum, or 'roasting' and 'maturing' of a prepared dish. In this cuisine, herbs and spices are important. The process of slow roasting gently allows each to release their maximum flavour. The sealing of the lid of the handi with dough achieves maturing. Cooking slowly in its juices, the food retains its natural aromas.[1] In some cases, cooking dough is spread over the container, like a lid, to seal the foods; this is known as pardah (veil). Upon cooking, it becomes a bread which has absorbed the flavors of the food. The bread is usually eaten with the dish.[1] Legend has it that when Nawab Asaf-ud-daulah (1748\u20131797) found his kingdom in the grip of famine, he initiated a food-for-work program, employing thousands in the construction of the Bada Imambara shrine. Large cauldrons were filled with rice, meat, vegetables, and spices and sealed to make a simple one-dish meal that was available to workers day and night. One day the Nawab caught a whiff of the aromas emanating from the cauldron and the royal kitchen was ordered to serve the dish.[6][2] Other sources, however, simply state that dum pukht appears to be based on a traditional Peshawar method of cooking dishes buried in sand.[7]",

[2] Jalfrezi means \"hot-fry\".[3] It consists of a main ingredient such as meat, fish, paneer or vegetables, stir-fried and served in a thick spicy sauce that includes green chilli peppers.[4] Common further ingredients include bell peppers, onions and tomatoes. Jalfrezi recipes appeared in cookbooks of British India as a way of using up leftovers by frying them with chilli and onion.[5] This English-language usage derived from the colloquial Bengali term jh\u0101l porhez\u012b: jh\u0101l means spicy food; porhez\u012b means suitable for a diet.[6][7] Jalfrezi is usually prepared by stir-frying ingredients, a technique introduced to the region by Chinese cuisine. Jalfrezi is typically made from green peppers, onions, and tomatoes.[8] Additional ingredients include spices like paprika and coriander.[9] Vegetables or meat are then stir-fried into the mix.[10] Jalfrezi is often served alongside pulao.[2] In a survey in 2011, jalfrezi was rated the most popular dish in UK Indian and broader South Asian restaurants.[11][12]  This Bangladeshi cuisine\u2013related article is a stub.

    "Aloo Tikki": " Aloo tikki, also known as aloo ki tikkia, aloo ki tikki or alu tikki, is a snack originating from the Indian subcontinent. In Indian, Pakistani, and Bangladeshi preparation, it is made of boiled potatoes, peas, and various curry spices. Aloo means potato in Hindi-Urdu, and tikki is a small cutlet or croquette. The dish is served hot along with a side of saunth, tamarind, and coriander-mint sauce, and sometimes dahi (yogurt) or chickpeas.[1] The snack is vegetarian[2] and is an Indian equivalent of the hash brown. Because of the broad geographical distribution of Indian people throughout the world, a number of variations on this dish exist. In Mumbai, a popular version of aloo tikki is served with a spicy curry and various chutneys. It is called Ragda pattice and is sold at various chaat stalls throughout the city and especially on Chowpatti Beach. The aloo tikki in this region is made of mainly locally grown spices such as turmeric, whereas in Bangalore, more coriander is used. In the United Kingdom, vegetable tikki is available from delicatessen counters at various shops.[citation needed] Some North Indian dhabas or caf\u00e9-style eateries will sandwich the aloo in bread.[citation needed] Hot",

    "Wazwan": "Wazwan (Kashmiri pronunciation: [wa\u02d0z\u0268wa\u02d0n]) is a multi-course meal in Kashmiri cuisine, originating from Kashmir. Almost all the dishes are meat-based using lamb, chicken or mutton  with few vegetarian dishes. It is popular throughout the larger Kashmir region. Moreover, Wazwan is also served internationally at Kashmiri food festivals and reunions.[1] In the Kashmiri language, waz means 'cook' or 'cooking' and wan means 'shop'. The ultimate formal banquet in Kashmir is the royal wazwan. Of its thirty-six courses, between fifteen and thirty can be preparations of meat, cooked overnight under the supervision of a master chef called a wouste waze. Guests are seated in groups of four and share the meal out of a large copper plate called the traem. A ritual washing of hands in a portable basin called the Tash-t-naer, which is taken around by attendants. Then the traem arrives, heaped with rice, quartered by two seekh kababs and contains four pieces of methi maaz, (mutton intestines flavored with a spice mixture containing dried fenugreek (methi) leaves), two tabakh maaz (twice-cooked lamb ribs, initially braised with ground spices, then browned in ghee), one safed kokur (chicken with white sauce), one zafran kokur (chicken with saffron sauce), and the first few courses. Yogurt and chutney are served separately in small earthen pots. Up to about 20 items are served thereafter by waza (the junior cook). Seven dishes are a must for these occasions \u2014 tabakh maaz, rista (meatballs in a red, paprika-saffron-fennel spice gravy colored with dyer's alkanet), rogan josh, daniwal korma (lamb roasted with yoghurt, spices and onion puree, topped with coriander leaves), aab gosh (lamb chunks cooked with a fennel-based spice mixture, cardamom and partially evaporated milk), marchhwangan korma (chicken legs/thighs cooked in a spicy browned-onion sauce) and gushtaba (meatballs cooked in a spicy yoghurt gravy).[2][3] The main course usually ends with gushtaba.[4] The gushtaba is a large meatball which signals the end of the main course. After that, desserts are served. In winters, the dessert can be a hot sweet dish and in summers, it is usually something cold. http://kashmironline.net/category/food/wazwan/ Hot",
    "Yakhni": "Yakhni (Persian: \u06cc\u062e\u0646\u06cc,[1] Arabic: \u064a\u062e\u0646\u064a, Urdu: \u06cc\u062e\u0646\u06cc, Hindi: \u092f\u0916\u093c\u0928\u0940, Greek: \u03b3\u03b9\u03b1\u03c7\u03bd\u03af[2]), yahni (Turkish[3]), or yahniya (Bulgarian: \u044f\u0445\u043d\u0438\u044f, Serbian, Macedonian: \u0458\u0430\u043d\u0438\u0458\u0430), jahni (Albanian[4]) is a class of dishes traditionally prepared in a vast area encompassing South Asia, the Middle East and the Balkans.[5] A meat stew named yakhni originated as a Medieval Iranian cuisine. The name derives from the covered clay pot in which it was originally cooked.[5] The meaning of the Persian word is \"store of food\".[5][1] Different varieties of this dish later spread eastwards to Afghanistan, Uzbekistan and South Asia and westwards to the Ottoman Empire reaching the Levant and the Balkans.[5] In Iranian cuisine, yakhni is a meat stew akin to khoresh, while yakhni-polow is a pilaf cooked in a stew.[5] In Arab (especially Palestinian), Albanian, Greek, and Turkish cuisines, it is a stew of meat, fish, or vegetables in a browned-onion base with tomatoes and olive oil. In Bulgarian cuisine, sunflower oil is used instead of olive oil. In Romanian cuisine, the term iahnie de fasole refers to a style of baked beans, often cooked or served with smoked meat and sausages (fasole cu c\u00e2rna\u021bi). In  Pakistan and India, yakhni refers to stock or broth of beef, chicken, lamb or mutton.[6] It is touted for its health benefits[7] and is often the base for many foods including pulao[8] (a pilaf) and other shorbas (soups). In Bangladesh, akhni is a mixed rice dish and variant of the biryani and polao dishes. A version of the dish is also part of the Romani cuisine.[9]",
    "Crab Curry (Goan)": "  Crabs are decapod crustaceans of the infraorder Brachyura (meaning \"short tail\" in Greek), which typically have a very short projecting tail-like abdomen, usually hidden entirely under the thorax.[a] They live in all the world's oceans, in freshwater, and on land, are generally covered with a thick exoskeleton, and have a single pair of pincers on each arm. They first appeared during the Jurassic period, around 200 million years ago. Crabs are generally covered with a thick exoskeleton, composed primarily of highly mineralized chitin.[4][5] Behind their pair of chelae (claws) are six walking legs and then two swimming legs. The crab breathes through gills on its underside; gills must be at least moist to work. Crabs vary in size from the pea crab, a few millimeters wide, to the Japanese spider crab, with a leg span up to 4\u00a0m (13\u00a0ft).[6] Several other groups of crustaceans with similar appearances \u2013 such as king crabs and porcelain crabs \u2013 are not true crabs, but have evolved features similar to true crabs through a process known as carcinisation.[7][8][9][10] Crabs are found in all of the world's oceans, as well as in fresh water and on land, particularly in tropical regions. About 850 species are freshwater crabs.[11] Crabs often show marked sexual dimorphism. Males often have larger claws,[12] a tendency that is particularly pronounced in the fiddler crabs of the genus Uca (Ocypodidae). In fiddler crabs, males have one greatly enlarged claw used for communication, particularly for attracting a mate.[13] Another conspicuous difference is the form of the pleon (abdomen); in most male crabs, this is narrow and triangular in form, while females have a broader, rounded abdomen.[14] This is because female crabs brood fertilised eggs on their pleopods. Crabs attract a mate through chemical (pheromones), visual, acoustic, or vibratory means. Pheromones are used by most fully aquatic crabs, while terrestrial and semiterrestrial crabs often use visual signals, such as fiddler crab males waving their large claws to attract females. The vast number of brachyuran crabs have internal fertilisation and mate belly-to-belly. For many aquatic species, mating takes place just after the female has moulted and is still soft. Females can store the sperm for a long time before using it to fertilise their eggs. When fertilisation has taken place, the eggs are released onto the female's abdomen, below the tail flap, secured with a sticky material. In this location, they are protected during embryonic development. Females carrying eggs are called \"berried\" since the eggs resemble round berries. When development is complete, the female releases the newly hatched larvae into the water, where they are part of the plankton. The release is often timed with the tidal and light/dark diurnal cycle.[15][16] The free-swimming tiny zoea larvae can float and take advantage of water currents. They have a spine, which probably reduces the rate of predation by larger animals. The zoea of most species must find food, but some crabs provide enough yolk in the eggs that the larval stages can continue to live off the yolk. Each species has a particular number of zoeal stages, separated by moults, before they change into a megalopa stage, which resembles an adult crab, except for having the abdomen (tail) sticking out behind. After one more moult, the crab is a juvenile, living on the bottom rather than floating in the water. This last moult, from megalopa to juvenile, is critical, and it must take place in a habitat that is suitable for the juvenile to survive.[17]:\u200a63\u201377 Most species of terrestrial crabs must migrate down to the ocean to release their larvae; in some cases, this entails very extensive migrations. After living for a short time as larvae in the ocean, the juveniles must do this migration in reverse. In many tropical areas with land crabs, these migrations often result in considerable roadkill of migrating crabs.[17]:\u200a113\u2013114 Once crabs have become juveniles, they still have to keep moulting many more times to become adults. They are covered with a hard shell, which would otherwise prevent growth. The moult cycle is coordinated by hormones. When preparing for moult, the old shell is softened and partly eroded away, while the rudimentary beginnings of a new shell form under it. At the time of moulting, the crab takes in a lot of water to expand and crack open the old shell at a line of weakness along the back edge of the carapace. The crab must then extract all of itself \u2013 including its legs, mouthparts, eyestalks, and even the lining of the front and back of the digestive tract \u2013 from the old shell. This is a difficult process that takes many hours, and if a crab gets stuck, it will die. After freeing itself from the old shell (now called an exuvia), the crab is extremely soft and hides until its new shell has hardened. While the new shell is still soft, the crab can expand it to make room for future growth.[17]:\u200a78\u201379 Crabs typically walk sideways[18] (hence the term crabwise), because of the articulation of the legs which makes a sidelong gait more efficient.[19] Some crabs walk forward or backward, including raninids,[20] Libinia emarginata[21] and Mictyris platycheles.[18] Some crabs, like the Portunidae and Matutidae, are also capable of swimming,[22] the Portunidae especially so as their last pair of walking legs are flattened into swimming paddles.[17]:\u200a96 Crabs are mostly active animals with complex behaviour patterns such as communicating by drumming or waving their pincers. Crabs tend to be aggressive toward one another, and males often fight to gain access to females.[23] On rocky seashores, where nearly all caves and crevices are occupied, crabs may also fight over hiding holes.[24] Fiddler crabs (genus Uca) dig burrows in sand or mud, which they use for resting, hiding, and mating, and to defend against intruders.[17]:\u200a28\u201329,\u200a99 Crabs are omnivores, feeding primarily on algae,[25] and taking any other food, including molluscs, worms, other crustaceans, fungi, bacteria, and detritus, depending on their availability and the crab species. For many crabs, a mixed diet of plant and animal matter results in the fastest growth and greatest fitness.[26][27] Some species are more specialised in their diets, based in plankton, clams or fish.[17]:\u200a85 Crabs are known to work together to provide food and protection for their family, and during mating season to find a comfortable spot for the female to release her eggs.[28] Crabs make up 20% of all marine crustaceans caught, farmed, and consumed worldwide, amounting to 1.5\u00a0million tonnes annually. One species, Portunus trituberculatus, accounts for one-fifth of that total. Other commercially important taxa include Portunus pelagicus, several species in the genus Chionoecetes, the blue crab (Callinectes sapidus), Charybdis spp., Cancer pagurus, the Dungeness crab (Metacarcinus magister), and Scylla serrata, each of which yields more than 20,000\u00a0tonnes annually.[29] In some crab species, meat is harvested by manually twisting and pulling off one or both claws and returning the live crab to the water in the knowledge that the crab may survive and regenerate the claws.[30][31][32] Crabs are prepared and eaten as a dish in many different ways all over the world. Some species are eaten whole, including the shell, such as soft-shell crab; with other species, just the claws or legs are eaten. The latter is particularly common for larger crabs, such as the snow crab. In many cultures, the roe of the female crab is also eaten, which usually appears orange or yellow in fertile crabs. This is popular in Southeast Asian cultures, some Mediterranean and Northern European cultures, and on the East, Chesapeake, and Gulf Coasts of the United States. In some regions, spices improve the culinary experience. In Southeast Asia and the Indosphere, masala crab and chilli crab are examples of heavily spiced dishes. In the Chesapeake Bay region, blue crab is often steamed with Old Bay Seasoning. Alaskan king crab or snow crab legs are usually simply boiled and served with garlic or lemon butter. For the British dish dressed crab, the crab meat is extracted and placed inside the hard shell. One American way to prepare crab meat is by extracting it and adding varying amounts of binders, such as egg white, cracker meal, mayonnaise, or mustard, creating a crab cake.  Crabs can also be made into a bisque, a global dish of French origin which in its authentic form includes in the broth the pulverized shells of the shellfish from which it is made. Imitation crab, also called surimi, is made from minced fish meat that is crafted and colored to resemble crab meat. While it is sometimes disdained among some elements of the culinary industry as an unacceptably low-quality substitute for real crab, this does not hinder its popularity, especially as a sushi ingredient in Japan and South Korea, and in home cooking, where cost is often a chief concern.[33] Indeed, surimi is an important source of protein in most East and Southeast Asian cultures, appearing in staple ingredients such as fish balls and fish cake. Whether crustaceans as a whole experience pain or not is a scientific debate that has ethical implications for crab dish preparation. Crabs are very often boiled alive as part of the cooking process. Advocates for Animals, a Scottish animal welfare group, stated in 2005 that \"scientific evidence ... strongly suggests that there is a potential for decapod crustaceans and cephalopods to experience pain and suffering\". This is primarily due to \"The likelihood that decapod crustaceans can feel pain [which] is supported by the fact that they have been shown to have opioid receptors and to respond to opioids (analgesics such as morphine) in a similar way to vertebrates.\"  Similarities between decapod and vertebrate stress systems and behavioral responses to noxious stimuli were given as additional evidence for the capacity of decapods to experience pain.[34] In 2005 a review of the literature by the Norwegian Scientific Committee for Food Safety tentatively concluded that \"it is unlikely that [lobsters] can feel pain,\" though they note that \"there is apparently a paucity of exact knowledge on sentience in crustaceans, and more research is needed.\" This conclusion is based on the lobster's simple nervous system. The report assumes that the violent reaction of lobsters to boiling water is a reflex response (i.e. does not involve conscious perception) to noxious stimuli.[35] The earliest unambiguous crab fossils date from the Early Jurassic, with the oldest being Eocarcinus from the early Pliensbachian of Britain, which likely represents a stem-group lineage, as it lacks several key morphological features that define modern crabs.[37][38] Most Jurassic crabs are only known from dorsal (top half of the body) carapaces, making it difficult to determine their relationships.[39] Crabs radiated in the Late Jurassic, corresponding with an increase in reef habitats, though they would decline at the end of the Jurassic as the result of the decline of reef ecosystems. Crabs increased in diversity through the Cretaceous and represented the dominant group of decapods by the end of the period.[40] The crab infraorder Brachyura belongs to the group Reptantia, which consists of the walking/crawling decapods (lobsters and crabs).  Brachyura is the sister clade to the infraorder Anomura, which contains the hermit crabs and relatives.  The cladogram below shows Brachyura's placement within the larger order Decapoda, from analysis by Wolfe et al., 2019.[41]  Dendrobranchiata (prawns) Stenopodidea (boxer shrimp) Procarididea Caridea (\"true\" shrimp) Achelata (spiny lobsters and slipper lobsters) Polychelida (benthic crustaceans) Astacidea (lobsters and crayfish) Axiidea (mud shrimp, ghost shrimp, and burrowing shrimp) Gebiidea (mud lobsters and mud shrimp) Anomura (hermit crabs and allies) Brachyura (\"true\" crabs)  Brachyura is separated into several sections, with the basal Dromiacea diverging the earliest in the evolutionary history, around the Late Triassic or Early Jurassic.  The group consisting of Raninoida and Cyclodorippoida split off next, during the Jurassic period.  The remaining clade Eubrachyura then divided during the Cretaceous period into Heterotremata and Thoracotremata.\nA summary of the high-level internal relationships within Brachyura can be shown in the cladogram below:\n[42]\n[41] Dromiacea Raninoida Cyclodorippoida Heterotremata Thoracotremata There is a no consensus on the relationships of the subsequent superfamilies and families.  The proposed cladogram below is from analysis by Tsang et al, 2014:[42] Dromiidae (may be paraphyletic) Dynomenidae Homolidae (paraphyletic) Latreilliidae Raninidae Cyclodorippidae Cymonomidae Potamonautidae Potamidae Gecarcinucidae Pseudothelphusidae  Trichodactylidae (freshwater crabs) Orithyiidae Belliidae Chasmocarcinidae Retroplumidae Ethusidae Dorippidae Leucosiidae Inachidae Epialtidae (paraphyletic) Majidae / Mithracidae Corystidae Euryplacidae Matutidae Calappidae Parthenopidae Cancridae Carpiliidae Aethridae Pseudocarcinus of Menippidae Menippe of Menippidae Polybiidae Portunidae Tanaochelidae Galenidae Pilumnidae Mathildellidae Eriphiidae Oziidae Vultocinidae Trapeziidae Goneplacidae Scalopidiidae Xanthidae (paraphyletic) Panopeidae Pinnotheridae Dotillidae Percnidae Xenograpsidae Cryptochiridae Ocypodidae Glyptograpsidae Grapsidae Plagusiidae Gecarcinidae Sesarmidae Mictyridae Varunidae Macrophthalmidae The infraorder Brachyura contains approximately 7,000 species in 98 families,[42][22] as many as the remainder of the Decapoda.[43] The evolution of crabs is characterized by an increasingly robust body, and a reduction in the abdomen. Although many other groups have undergone similar processes, carcinisation is most advanced in crabs. The telson is no longer functional in crabs, and the uropods are absent, having probably evolved into small devices for holding the reduced abdomen tight against the sternum. In most decapods, the gonopores (sexual openings) are found on the legs. Since crabs use their first two pairs of pleopods (abdominal appendages) for sperm transfer, this arrangement has changed. As the male abdomen evolved into a slimmer shape, the gonopores have moved toward the midline, away from the legs, and onto the sternum.[44] A similar change occurred, independently, with the female gonopores. The movement of the female gonopore to the sternum defines the clade Eubrachyura, and the later change in the position of the male gonopore defines the Thoracotremata. It is still a subject of debate whether a monophyletic group is formed by those crabs where the female, but not male, gonopores are situated on the sternum.[43] Numbers of extant and extinct (\u2020) species are given in brackets.[1] The superfamily Eocarcinoidea, containing Eocarcinus and Platykotta, was formerly thought to contain the oldest crabs; it is now considered part of the Anomura.[45] Recent studies have found the following superfamilies and families to not be monophyletic, but rather paraphyletic or polyphyletic:[42][41][48][47] Both the constellation Cancer and the astrological sign Cancer are named after the crab, and depicted as a crab. William Parsons, 3rd Earl of Rosse drew the Crab Nebula in 1848 and noticed its similarity to the animal; the Crab Pulsar lies at the centre of the nebula.[49] The Moche people of ancient Peru worshipped nature, especially the sea,[50] and often depicted crabs in their art.[51] In Greek mythology, Karkinos was a crab that came to the aid of the Lernaean Hydra as it battled Heracles. One of Rudyard Kipling's Just So Stories, The Crab that Played with the Sea, tells the story of a gigantic crab who made the waters of the sea go up and down, like the tides.[52]  The auction for the crab quota in 2019, Russia is the largest revenue auction in the world except the spectrum auctions.[citation needed] In Malay mythology (as related by Hugh Clifford to Walter William Skeat), ocean tides are believed to be caused by water rushing in and out of a hole in the Navel of the Seas (Pusat Tasek), where \"there sits a gigantic crab which twice a day gets out in order to search for food\".[53]:\u200a7\u20138 The Kapsiki people of North Cameroon use the way crabs handle objects for divination.[citation needed] The term crab mentality is derived from a type of detrimental social behavior observed in crabs.

It is mostly eaten by  people of the coastal regions and the areas of River basins of Odisha, India. The curry is prepared by frying the prawns in mustard oil, and then in a mixture of garam masala\u2014including cinnamon. Bay leaves are also used when making the curry. Some variations of chungudi jhola include the use of coconut-cashew paste. The curry includes an abundance of tomato and garlic which gives the curry a reddish hue and spicy flavour.

    "Noon Chai": "Noon chai (Kashmiri pronunciation: [nu\u02d0n\u0268 t\u0361\u0283a\u02d0j]), also called Kashmiri tea, pink tea, gulabi chai,[1] Namkeen chai (pronounced [namki\u02d0n t\u0361\u0283a\u02d0j]),[2][better\u00a0source\u00a0needed] and  Sheer chai ([\u0283i\u02d0r\u02b2 t\u0361\u0283a\u02d0j])[3] is a traditional tea beverage originating in Kashmir. It is made with gunpowder tea (green tea leaves rolled into small balls), milk and baking soda.[3] It has become popular in Pakistan, India and the Caribbean.[4] The word noon means 'salt' in several Indo-Aryan languages, such as Kashmiri, Bengali and Nepali.[5] Kashmiri Hindus refer to this Kashmiri tea as \"Sheer chai\".[6] \"Shir\", the term from which \"Sheer chai\" is derived from, means \"milk\" in Persian.[3] \"Tea pink\" is also used as an adjective referencing the characteristic pink hue of the tea, such as to describe textiles.[1] Noon chai is traditionally made from green tea leaves, milk, salt and baking soda, and is usually cooked in a samavar.[1] The leaves are boiled for about an hour[7] with baking soda until it develops a burgundy colouration, then ice or cold water is added to \"shock\" it and make it stay that colour. When milk is added, it combines with the burgundy to yield its signature pink colour. It is then aerated by ladling out some of it and pouring it back into the pot to incorporate tiny air bubbles into it, a process that yields a froth and that may take hours to do by hand.[1] Sugar is not traditionally used in Kashmiri recipes, although newer commercial preparations in many restaurants around the world and tea stalls that serve Kashmiri cuisine may include sweeteners or exclude salt.[1] In Pakistan, it is often served with sugar and nuts.[2] When tea leaves are boiled, molecules called polyphenols are extracted from the leaves into the water. In green teas like those used in Noon chai, the polyphenols extracted act similar to the substance phenol red, which changes color depending on the pH level of the substance it is in\u2014yellow when it is acidic, and red when it is alkaline. Since Noon chai is boiled for a long time, a lot of color-changing polyphenols are extracted from the leaves. When alkaline baking soda (sodium bicarbonate) is added to it, the tea takes on its deep red color (which then turns pink with milk).[7] Origin stories of the tea allege that it came from Yarkland (which later became Xinjiang, China) to Kashmir through the Silk Road. Noon chai originates from the Himalayas, where salt was added as an electrolyte to prevent dehydration at high altitudes. It is also related to other Central Asian salty milk teas, such as the Uyghur tea etkanchay and the Mongolian tea suutei tsai.[1] Use of alkaline salts, like baking soda, in tea originated from the Tibetan plateau, where naturally-occurring deposits of soda were used to darken po cha. Later, in Ladakh, eastern Kashmir, hot spring soda crystals were used in local butter tea, or gur gur cha. Residents of Kashmir Valley adopted the practice from Ladakh, importing soda (called phul) from them and brick tea from Lhasa, then replacing yak butter with milk and cream to fit local tastes.[1] Noon chai is popularly consumed numerous times per day in Kashmir, served with breads such as kulcha, girda, or tsochwor.

    "Dum Aloo": " Dum aloo (also spelled as dam aloo, Hindi: \u0926\u092e \u0906\u0932\u0942, romanized:\u00a0dam \u0101l\u016b), aloor dum (Bengali: \u0986\u09b2\u09c1\u09b0 \u09a6\u09ae, romanized:\u00a0\u0101l\u016br dam) or aloo dum (Odia: \u0b06\u0b33\u0b41 \u0b26\u0b2e, romanized:\u00a0\u0101l\u016b dam) is a potato-based curry dish. The word dum translates to as steam-cooked or slow-cooked, while aloo means potato.[1] It is a part of the traditional  Kashmiri Pandit cuisine,[2][3] from the Kashmir Valley, in the Indian state of Jammu and Kashmir. Dum aloo is cooked widely in India and Pakistan.[4] There are also Banarasi and Bengali variations.[1] The potatoes, usually smaller ones, are first skinned and deep fried.[5] Kashmiri dum aloo sauce is made with yogurt or khoya, and often includes a cashew nut paste.[5] The Banarasi variation sauce is typically more aromatic and is made from tomatoes and onions.[6] Spices such as red chilies, garlic, ginger, cardamom, and fennel along with other herbs, are added to the sauce.[7][8]  The potatoes are cooked slowly at low flame in the sauce, and can be garnished with coriander.[9][10] Dum aloo is often paired and served with naan.[6]  This Indian cuisine\u2013related article is a stub.

    "Harees": " Harees, jareesh (Arabic: \u0647\u0631\u064a\u0633), boko boko, or harisa (Armenian: \u0570\u0561\u0580\u056b\u057d\u0561, romanized:\u00a0harisa) is a dish of boiled, cracked, or coarsely-ground cracked wheat or bulgur, mixed with meat and seasoned.[1] Its consistency varies between a porridge and a gruel. Harees is a popular dish known throughout Armenia where it is served on Easter day, and the Arab world, where it is commonly eaten in Arab states of the Persian Gulf in the month of Ramadan, and in Iraq, Lebanon and Bahrain during Ashura by Shia Muslims. \"Harisa\", also transliterated as \"horisa\", derived from the Arabic verb \"haras\" meaning \"to squish\" to describe the action of breaking and pounding the grains before mixing it with water to create a porridge.[2] In Arabic, \"Harees\" (Arabic: \u0647\u0631\u064a\u0633) is linked to the verb (Arabic: \u0647\u064e\u0631\u064e\u0633\u064e, romanized:\u00a0harasa) which still means to mash or to squash.[3] According to Armenian lore, the patron saint of Armenia, Gregory the Illuminator, was offering a meal of love and charity to the poor. There weren't enough sheep to feed the crowds so wheat was added to the cooking pots. They noticed that the wheat was sticking to the bottom of the cauldrons. Saint Gregory advised, \"Harekh! Stir it!\" Thus, the name of the dish, harissa, came from the saint's own words. Harissa has been offered as a charity meal ever since.[4] The dish is traditionally served on Easter day. It is still prepared by many Armenians around the world and is also considered the national dish of Armenia.[4] According to medieval Armenian lore, the patron saint of Armenia, Gregory the Illuminator, was offering a meal of love and charity to the poor. There weren't enough sheep to feed the crowds so wheat was added to the cooking pots. They noticed that the wheat was sticking to the bottom of the cauldrons. Saint Gregory advised, \"Harekh! Stir it!\" Thus, the name of the dish, harissa, came from the saint's own words. Harissa has been offered as a charity meal ever since.[5] The dish is traditionally served on Easter day. It is still prepared by many Armenians around the world and is also considered the national dish of Armenia.[6] Harisa is mentioned by Ibn Al Karim in Kitab Al-Tabikh as early as the seventh century.[7] In the anecdotal cookbook, the Umayyad Caliph, Mu'awiya, returns from a trip to Arabia after returning to his newly won Persian lands. In some versions of the story, Mu'awiya is met with some Yemenite Jews whom he asks to prepare the porrige he tasted abroad while in other versions, he approaches locals. This story should be taken with a grain of salt as the author penned the story three centuries after it supposedly occurred. At the very least, harisa was prevalent as a Levantine dish. Harees is documented in Ibn Sayyar al-Warraq's 10th-century cookbook Kitab Al Tabikh.,[8] as well as in al-Baghdadi's 13th-century cookbook Kitab Al Tabikh and ibn Razin al-Tujibi's  13th-century Andalusian cookbook Kitab Fadalat al-khiwan fi tayyibat al-ta'am w'al-alwan. Harees is also the origin of haleem,[9] and cholent.[10] The wheat is soaked overnight, then simmered in water along with meat and butter or sheep tail fat. Any remaining liquid is strained and the mixture is beaten and seasoned. Harees may be garnished with cinnamon, sugar, and clarified butter. There is a different traditional way of preparing Harees in each of the Arab countries in the Arabian Peninsula area, and among the tribes of these countries. Some variations include the use of cardamom pods in Saudi Arabia, or a garnish with parsley. Before the Armenian genocide where Armenians were spread through a larger area they also had different vatiations of Harisa. The wheat used in Armenian harissa is typically shelled (pelted) wheat, though in Adana, harissa was made with \u056f\u0578\u0580\u056f\u0578\u057f (korkot; ground, par-boiled shelled wheat). Harissa can be made with lamb, beef, or chicken.[11] Harees was only made by the wealthy during Ramadan and Eid, for the duration of a three- to seven-day wedding. It was, however, customary for the Harees dishes to be shared with poorer neighbours on such occasions.[citation needed] It is similar to kashkeg, a kind of homogeneous porridge made of previously stewed and boned chicken or lamb and coarsely ground soaked wheat (typically shelled wheat). Harees is a popular dish in Arab cuisine, from the Levant to the Persian Gulf. It is often served during Ramadan, festivals such as Eid ul-Fitr, and at weddings.[12] In Lebanon, it is often cooked on religious occasions in a communal pot, such as in Ashura. Harise is also a common dish in Syrian cuisine and Iraqi cuisine. Formerly found only in homes, it is now served in restaurants as well. Harisa (Armenian: \u0570\u0561\u0580\u056b\u057d\u0561, romanized:\u00a0harisa) is traditionally served on Easter day, and is considered a national dish of Armenia.[4] It is a thick porridge made from korkot (dried or roasted cracked wheat) and fat-rich meat, usually chicken or lamb. Herbs were substituted for meat in harissa when Armenian religious days required fasting and penance. The extremely long cooking process is an essential part of the harisa tradition. Like other ritual dishes, the time taken for preparation is part of its cherished value.[4] Harisa is known for helping the Armenians of Musa Ler (in modern-day Turkey) to survive during the resistance of 1915.[13] In Egyptian cuisine, \"freekeh\", unripened, crushed durum wheat, was used to cook harisa, giving the resulting ferik a unique green hue.[14] The origin of the variation could be linked to the Sephardic migration of the 13th century, but historians remain uncertain.[15] Harisa or Hareesa (Kashmiri\u00a0: \u06c2\u0631\u0620 \u0633\u06c1\u0655 [h\u0259r\u02b2s\u0268]) in Kashmir is prepared during winter (Chillai Kalan ),[16] typically made of mutton and rice flour and eaten with Kashmiri Bread called Girda (Kashmiri\u00a0: \u06af\u0650\u0631\u062f\u0655 [gird\u0268] ). It is cooked in huge degs (earthen pots) placed in wood fired ovens. Downtown Srinagar is considered as the hub of harisa making in Kashmir. In Zanzibar, the dish is called boko boko and may be cooked with lamb, beef, or chicken.[17] Hareesa, or harees, is a popular dish mainly in the Harari region. It is cooked with lamb or beef and served on Eid or special occasions such as the birth of a baby.[citation needed] Harees is a traditional Emirati dish made from wheat, meat (usually chicken or lamb), and a pinch of salt. The wheat is soaked overnight, then cooked with meat until it reaches a smooth, porridge-like consistency. This hearty dish is particularly popular during Ramadan and festive occasions. It is often garnished with ghee for added flavor. Harees is a staple in Emirati households and showcases the simplicity and richness of Emirati culinary traditions. [18]",
    "Kulcha": " Kulcha is a Persian term for a disc-shaped loaf of leavened bread.[1] In India, this term is commonly used for regular English bread (which is disc-shaped).[2] The term kulcha is Persian and describes a disc-shaped loaf of bread, bun or even biscuit.[1][3] However, in India this term came to be associated with round breads popularized during the British colonial period.[4] In some parts of India, naan or tandoori parantha is often confused with kulcha. Kulcha is made from maida flour, water, a pinch of salt and a leavening agent (yeast, sourdough or old kulcha dough), mixed together by hand to make a soft dough. This dough is covered with a wet cloth and left to rest for an hour or so in a warm place. The result is a slight leavening of the dough but not much. The flour is kneaded again by hand and then rolled out using a rolling pin into a flat, round shape. In commercial establishments, it is baked in an earthen clay oven (\"tandoor\") until done, but in most Indian homes they are cooked on an open girdle, tava or pan. After cooking, it is taken off the fire and optionally brushed with butter or ghee for a shiny, appetizing appearance. It is usually served with an Indian curry, in particular, a spicy chickpea curry known as chana masala.[5] Among variations, instead of using water to knead the dough, milk or yogurt can be used; which results in a softer and elastic dough enhancing the gluten binding process within the dough. This type of kulcha is known as doodhia kulcha (milk kulcha). Leavening is higher when yogurt is used to prepare the dough. This variant of kulchas is not stuffed but made plain and eaten with a curry which can be either vegetarian or meat-based. The second variant is the kulchas stuffed with fillings that were served during the period of the Mughals and Nizams in their Darbars.[6]  For example, in the Awadh region, Awadhi Kulcha is served with Nahari, a mutton based dish.[7] Nowadays, these are sold in restaurants and shops. Jammu's Kaladi Kulcha which is made with traditional Dogra Cheese i.e. Kaladi Cheese is one of the most-loved street foods in Jammu.[8] Kaladi cheese is saut\u00e9ed in oil on a pan, cooked till brown in colour on both sides and stuffed between roasted kulchas.[9] In Amritsar, Kulcha is often confused with tandoori parantha or naans which have become popular there in recent decades.[10] In entire North India, a range of stuffings, including paneer (cottage cheese), potatoes, radish, onion and other vegetables are used to stuff these kulchas. In Pakistan, kulcha breads are largely eaten in certain parts of the Hazara and Pothwhar regions, where they are a popular breakfast item.[11]",
    "Lavash": "Lavash (Armenian: \u056c\u0561\u057e\u0561\u0577; Persian: \u0646\u0627\u0646 \u0644\u0648\u0627\u0634) is a thin flatbread[9] usually leavened, traditionally baked in a tandoor (tonir or tanoor) or on a sajj, and common to the cuisines of South Caucasus, West Asia, and the areas surrounding the Caspian Sea.[10][11][12] Lavash is one of the most widespread types of bread in Armenia, Azerbaijan, Iran and Turkey.[13] The traditional recipe can be adapted to the modern kitchen by using a griddle or wok instead of the tonir.[14] In 2014, \"Lavash, the preparation, meaning and appearance of traditional bread as an expression of culture in Armenia\" was inscribed in the UNESCO Representative List of the Intangible Cultural Heritage of Humanity.[15] In 2016, making and sharing flatbread (lavash, katyrma, jupka or yufka) in communities of Azerbaijan, Iran, Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan and Turkey was inscribed on the list as well.[16] Lavash is similar to yufka, but in Turkish cuisine lavash (lava\u015f) is prepared with a yeast dough while yufka is typically unleavened.[17] Hrach Martirosyan tentatively connects Armenian lavash with dialectal \u056c\u0561\u0583 lap\u02bf, \u056c\u0578\u0582\u0583 lup\u02bf, \u056c\u0578\u057e\u0561\u0566 lovaz 'palm, flat of the hand', \u056c\u0561\u0583\u0578\u0582\u056f lap\u02bfuk, \u056c\u0565\u0583\u0578\u0582\u056f lep\u02bfuk 'flat, polished stone for playing', \u056c\u0561\u057e\u0561\u0566 lavaz 'very thin' and assumes derivation from Proto-Armenian *law 'flat'. He remarks that semantically this is conceivable since this bread is specifically flat and thin.[18] Sevan Ni\u015fanyan connects the Persian word for lavash to the Aramaic \u05dc\u05d5\u05e9\u05c1 lw\u0161 root meaning 'to knead' and recorded al-Faraj ba'd ash-Shiddah from 1451 as the oldest text to use the term in Turkish.[19] Compare especially to Assyrian Neo-Aramaic \u0720\u0735\u0718\u0735\u072b\u0735\u0710 lawasha, a flap of thin bread.[20] Gil Marks traces the history of lavash to the early innovation of cooking thin flatbreads on terracotta griddles. The earliest forms of bread were cooked as cakes either on heated rocks or in embers, but when griddles started to be used breads had to be made thinner to fully cook through without burning like the bread rakik described in the Bible. With the innovation of early ovens, thicker loaves became possible.[11] According to The American Heritage Dictionary of the English Language lavash is \"a thin unleavened flatbread of Armenian origin\".[1] In 2014, Lavash was described by the Intangible Cultural Heritage of Humanity as \"an expression of Armenian culture\". This decision led to protests in Azerbaijan, Iran, Kyrgyzstan, and Kazakhstan over claims that the food was \"regional\", not \"Armenian\".[21][22] The origin of lavash is often attributed to Armenia,[2][3][4][5] or Iran.[6][7][8] Food historian Gil Marks identifies the origin more generally as the Middle East.[11] Lavash is made with flour, water, yeast, sugar and salt. It can also be made in an unleavened version by omitting sugar and yeast.[23] Toasted sesame seeds and/or poppy seeds are sometimes sprinkled on before baking. Traditionally the dough is rolled out flat and slapped against the hot walls of a clay oven, but modern recipes may adapt for cooking on a wok or tava. While quite flexible when fresh, lavash dries out quickly and becomes brittle and hard. The soft form is easier to use when making wrap sandwiches. In Armenian villages, dried lavash is stacked high in layers to be used later, and when the time comes to rehydrate the bread, it is sprinkled with water to make it softer again. The dried bread is broken up into khash (\u056d\u0561\u0577), while fresh lavash is used to wrap the Armenian specialty dish khorovats (\u056d\u0578\u0580\u0578\u057e\u0561\u056e) and to make other wraps with herbs and cheese. In Iran, Turkey and some Middle Eastern countries lavash is used with kebabs to make d\u00fcr\u00fcm wraps like tantuni. In its dry form, leftover lavash is used in Iran to make quick meals after being rehydrated with water, butter, or cheese. In Turkish cuisine lava\u015f can be used also for sweet dishes and served alongside some traditional Turkish dessert dishes like kaysefe, hasude, pestil kavurmas\u0131 ('braised fruit leather'), a\u011fuz and helva.[24] In Kashmiri cuisine, lavas is traditionally used with the morning tea, also known as Noon Chai or Sheer Chai.[25][26] In modern recipes lavash can be used like pizza dough.[27] In Armenia, it is traditional for the mother of the groom to feed the newly wed couple lavash and honey as a wish of good fortune, fertility and sweetness for the couple.[citation needed] Dried lavash can be stored over a long time period (almost one year) and is used instead of leavened bread[citation needed] in Eucharist traditions by the Armenian Apostolic Church.[citation needed] In Sabirabad District of Azerbaijan after a wedding when the bride comes into her new house, her mother-in-law puts lavash on her shoulder and says: \"Let you come to the house of wealth, let your foot be lucky\".[28] In the Novkhani settlement, after a funeral, it is customary for people to prepare kyulchya, which sometimes consists of halva wrapped up in lavash.[29] Women baking lavash is a common theme that has inspired Armenian painters. One such portrait by the famous Soviet-era painter Minas Minassian is displayed at the National Museum of Art in Yerevan. A print of the painting Armenian Ladies Baking Lavash by Armenian American artist Manuel Tolegian was selected by U.S. President Gerald Ford to hang in the White House Bicentennial Collection. The weekend open-air arts-and-crafts market in downtown Yerevan offers many lavash-related paintings and handiworks, with renditions of happy women making lavash having become a common sight.[30] Hot or cold",
    "Samosa": " A samosa (/s\u0259\u02c8mo\u028as\u0259/) (listen\u24d8) from the Persian word Sambosag (\u0633\u0646\u0628\u0648\u0633\u06af) \u00a0(Meaning triangular pastry) is a fried South Asian[2] and West Asian snack. It is a pastry with a savory filling, mostly vegetables, spiced potatoes, onions, peas, also non-vegetarian meat, or fish. It is made into different shapes, including triangular, cone, or crescent, depending on the region.[3][4][5] Samosas are often accompanied by chutney, and have origins in medieval times or earlier.[3] Sweet versions are also made. Samosas are a popular entr\u00e9e, appetizer, or snack in the cuisines of India, South Asia, West Asia, Central Asia, East Africa and their South Asian diasporas. The English word samosa derives from the Hindustani word samosa (Urdu: \u0633\u0645\u0648\u0633\u06c1, Hindi: \u0938\u092e\u094b\u0938\u093e),[6] traceable to the Middle Persian word sanbosag (\u0633\u0646\u0628\u0648\u0633\u06af)[7] 'triangular pastry'.[8] Similar pastries are called sambusak in Arabic; medieval Arabic recipe books sometimes spell it sambusaj, which are all borrowed from Persian sanbosag.[9] The South Asian samosa is believed to be derived from a medieval precursor from the Middle East[10][11] that was baked and not fried. The earliest mention of a samosa precursor was by Abbasid-era poet Ishaq al-Mawsili, praising the sanbusaj. Recipes are found in 10th\u201313th-century Arab cookery books, under the names sanbusak, sanbusaq, and sanbusaj, all deriving from the Persian word sanbosag. In Iran, the dish was popular until the 16th century, but by the 20th century its popularity was restricted to certain provinces (such as the sambusas of Larestan).[3] Abolfazl Beyhaqi (995\u20131077), an Iranian historian, mentioned it in his history, Tarikh-e Beyhaghi.[12] The Central Asian samsa was introduced to the Indian subcontinent in the 13th or 14th century by chefs from the Middle East and Central Asia who cooked in the royal kitchens for the rulers of the Delhi Sultanate.[13] Amir Khusro (1253\u20131325), a scholar and the royal poet of the Delhi Sultanate, wrote around 1300\u00a0CE that the princes and nobles enjoyed the \"samosa prepared from meat, ghee, onion, and so on\".[14] Ibn Battuta, a 14th-century traveler and explorer, describes a meal at the court of Muhammad bin Tughluq, where the samushak or sambusak, a small pie stuffed with minced meat, almonds, pistachios, walnuts and spices, was served before the third course of pulao.[15] Nimatnama-i-Nasiruddin-Shahi, a medieval Indian cookbook started for Ghiyath Shah, the ruler of the Malwa Sultanate in central India, mentions the art of making samosa.[16] The Ain-i-Akbari, a 16th-century Mughal document, mentions the recipe for qottab, which it says, \"the people of Hindustan call sanb\u00fasah\".[17] The samosa is prepared with an all-purpose flour (locally known as maida) and stuffed with a filling, often a mixture of diced and cooked or mashed boiled potato, onions, green peas, lentils, ginger, spices and green chili.[18][19] A samosa can be vegetarian or non-vegetarian, depending on the filling. The entire pastry is deep-fried in vegetable oil or (rarely) ghee to a golden brown. It is served hot, often with fresh green chutney, such as mint or coriander chutney, or tamarind chutney. It can also be prepared in a sweet form. Samosas are often served in chaat (a type of street food), along with the traditional accompaniments of either a chickpea or a white pea preparation, drizzled with yogurt, tamarind chutney and green chutney, and garnished with chopped onions, coriander, and chaat masala. In the Indian states of Assam, Odisha, West Bengal, Bihar and Jharkhand, singaras or shingras (\u099a\u09bf\u0982\u09f0\u09be)[20] (the East Indian version of samosas) are popular snacks found almost everywhere. They are a bit smaller than in other parts of India, with a filling consisting chiefly of cooked diced potato, peanuts, and sometimes raisins.[18] Shingras are wrapped in a thin sheet of dough (made of all-purpose flour) and fried. Good shingras are distinguished by flaky textures akin to that of a savory pie crust. Singaras may be eaten as a tea-time snack. They can also be prepared in a sweet form. Bengali singaras tend to be triangular, filled with potato, peas, onions, diced almonds, or other vegetables, and are more heavily fried and crunchier than other singaras or their samosa cousins. Singara filled with cauliflower mixture is a popular variation. Non-vegetarian varieties of singaras are mutton singaras and fish singaras. There are also sweet versions, such as coconut singara, as well as others filled with khoya and dipped in sugar syrup that are known as Mishti Shingara. In the city of Hyderabad, a smaller version of samosa with a thicker pastry crust and minced meat filling, referred to as lukhmi,[18] is consumed, as is another variation with an onion filling. In the states of Andhra Pradesh, Karnataka, Kerala, and Tamil Nadu, samosas are slightly different, being folded differently, more like Portuguese chamu\u00e7as, with a different style of pastry. The filling also differs, typically featuring mashed potatoes with spices, fried onions, peas, carrots, cabbage, curry leaves, and green chilis, and is mostly eaten without chutney. Samosas in South India are made in different sizes, whose fillings are influenced by local food habits, and may include meat. Both flat-shaped (triangular) and full-shaped (tetrahedron/triangular pyramid) samosas are popular snacks in Bangladesh. A Bengali version of the full-shaped samosa is called a \u09b8\u09bf\u0999\u09be\u09a1\u09bc\u09be (shingara) and is normally smaller than the standard variety. The shingara is usually filled with pieced potatoes, vegetables, nuts, etc. However, shingaras filled with beef liver are very popular in some parts of the country. The flat-shaped samosa is called a somosa or somucha, and is usually filled with onions and minced meat. Samosas are called singadas in the eastern zone of Nepal; the rest of the country calls it samosa. As in India, it is a very popular snack in Nepalese cuisine. Vendors sell the dish in various markets and restaurants. Samosas of various types are available throughout Pakistan. In general, most samosa varieties sold in the southern Sindh province and in the eastern Punjab, especially the city of Lahore, are spicier and mostly contain vegetable or potato-based fillings. However, the samosas sold in the west and north of the country mostly contain minced meat-based fillings and are comparatively less spicy. The meat samosa contains minced meat (lamb, beef, or chicken) and is very popular as a snack food in Pakistan. In Pakistan, the samosas of Karachi are famous for their spicy flavour, whereas samosas from Faisalabad are noted for being unusually large. Another distinct variety of samosa, available in Karachi, is called kaghazi samosa (Urdu: \u06a9\u0627\u063a\u0630\u06cc \u0633\u0645\u0648\u0633\u06c1; \"paper samosa\" in English) due to its thin and crispy covering, which resembles a wonton or spring roll wrapper. Another variant, popular in Punjab, consists of samosas with side dishes of mashed spiced chickpeas, onions, and coriander leaf salad, as well as various chutneys to top the samosas. Sweet samosas are also sold in the cities of Pakistan including Peshawar; these sweet samosas contain no filling and are dipped in thick sugar syrup. Another Pakistani snack food, which is popular in Punjab, is known as \"samosa chaat\". This is a combination of a crumbled samosa, along with spiced chickpeas (channa chaat), yogurt, and chutneys. Alternatively, the samosa can be eaten on its own with a side of chutney. In Pakistan, samosas are a staple Iftar food for many Pakistani families, during the month of Ramzan. The types and varieties of samosa made in Maldivian cuisine are known as bajiyaa. They are filled with a mixture including fish like tuna and onions.[21] Similar snacks and variants of samosas are found in many other countries. They are derived either from the South Asian somasa or are derived from the medieval precursor that originated in the Middle East. Samosas are called samuza (\u1005\u1019\u1030\u1006\u102c) in Burmese, and are an extremely popular street snack in Burma. Samosas are also used in a traditional Burmese salad, called samuza thoke (\u1005\u1019\u1030\u1006\u102c\u101e\u102f\u1015\u103a\u200c; lit.\u2009'samosa salad'), a salad of cut samosa pieces with onions, cabbage, fresh mint, light potato and chickpea curry broth, masala, chili powder, salt and lime.[22] In Indonesia, samosas are locally known as samosa, filled with potato, cheese, curry, rousong or noodles as adapted to local taste. They are usually served as a snack with sambal. Samosa is almost similar to Indonesian pastel, panada and epok-epok. Samosas are also a key part of East African food often seen in Somalia, Tanzania, Kenya, Uganda, Burundi, Eritrea, Ethiopia, and Rwanda. The variety of samosa made in Somali cuisine is known as \"sambusa\" or \"sambuus\" and is filled with ground beef or vegetables along with usually being blended with Somali spices.  Sambusa  is often consumed during Ramadan. Samosas are also a staple of local cuisine in the fellow Horn of Africa countries of Djibouti and Ethiopia, where they are known as sambuuse. Called samoosas in South Africa,[23][24] they tend to be smaller than Indian variants,[25] and form part of South African Indian and Cape Malay cuisine. Samosas also exist in West African countries such as Ghana and Nigeria where they are a common street food. In Nigeria, it is usually served in parties along with chicken or beef, puff puff, spring rolls and plantains and are called small chops. Samosas, locally called samoussas, are a popular snack on R\u00e9union and Mauritius as both islands have faced large waves of labor immigration from the Indian subcontinent. The samosas there are generally smaller and filled with chicken, cheese, crabs or potatoes. There are also varieties such as chocolate and banana or pizza.\n[26] Sambusak (Hebrew: \u05e1\u05de\u05d1\u05d5\u05e1\u05e7) comes in several distinct forms, as sambusak has been influenced differently by Sephardic and Mizrahi cuisine. Sephardi sambusak is generally thicker, baked, and stuffed with either cheese or beef and coated with sesame or nigella seeds. Mizrahi sambusak is generally thinner, larger, fried, and stuffed with curry-spiced chickpea and onion, and is usually not coated with seeds.[27][28][29][30][31] Sambousek (Arabic: \u0633\u0645\u0628\u0648\u0633\u0643) are usually filled with either meat, onion, pine nuts, za\u2019atar, spinach dock, or cheese.\nThey are widely consumed in the Muslim holy month of Ramadan. Sambuseh (Persian: \u0633\u0645\u0628\u0648\u0633\u0647) can often be found in the southern regions of Iran and rarely in other areas. However, traditionally it used to be made in the form of qottab filled with ground nuts (usually, walnuts), sugar, fragrant herbs or spices, and likewise fried in oil. It is used as a confectionary and quite commonly.  When meat is used, it is no longer called qottab. This is all that remains of the old \"sanbusag\" in its ancient homeland. Nowadays, Iranian Sambuseh is often made with a sausage and pizza cheese based filling; however, a vegetable-based variety also exists. In Goa (India), Portugal, and Angola, samosas are known as chamu\u00e7as. They are usually filled with chicken, beef, pork, lamb or vegetables, and generally served quite hot. Samosas are an integral part of Goan and Portuguese cuisine, where they are a common snack. Samosas are popular in the United Kingdom, Australia, New Zealand, Trinidad and Tobago, Barbados, Guyana, Uganda, South Africa, Rwanda, Kenya and Tanzania, and are also growing in popularity in Canada,[32][33] and the United States. They may be called samboosa or sambusac, but in South Africa, they are often called samoosa.[34] Frozen samosas are increasingly available from grocery stores in Australia, Canada, the United States,[35] and the United Kingdom, where they are also frequently sold fresh by local Indian and Pakistani street market vendors. Variations using filo,[36] or flour tortillas[37] are sometimes found. Al-Shabaab, the extremist group controlling parts of Somalia, banned samosas in 2011 over concerns about the possible use of rotten meat in the filling.[38] Hot",
    "Samovar": " A samovar (Russian: \u0441\u0430\u043c\u043e\u0432\u0430\u0440, IPA: [s\u0259m\u0250\u02c8var] \u24d8, literally \"self-brewer\") is a metal container traditionally used to heat and boil water. Although originating in Russia, the samovar is well known outside of Russia and has spread through Russian culture to other parts of Eastern Europe, as well as Western and Central and South Asia. Since the heated water is typically used to make tea, many samovars have a ring-shaped attachment (Russian: \u043a\u043e\u043d\u0444\u043e\u0440\u043a\u0430, konforka) around the chimney to hold and heat a teapot filled with tea concentrate.[1] Though traditionally heated with coal or kindling, many newer samovars use electricity to heat water in a manner similar to an electric water boiler. Antique samovars are often prized for their beautiful workmanship.[citation needed] Samovars are typically crafted out of plain iron, copper, polished brass, bronze, silver, gold, tin, or nickel. A typical samovar consists of a body, base and chimney, cover and steam vent, handles, tap and key, crown and ring, chimney extension and cap, drip-bowl, and teapot. The body shape can be an urn, krater, barrel, cylinder, or sphere. Sizes and designs vary, from large, \"40-pail\" ones (though largely metaphorical, food-service sized samovars were often very large indeed), to smaller family-sized ones, holding 4 litres (1.1\u00a0US\u00a0gal), to those of a modest  1 litre (0.26\u00a0US\u00a0gal) size.[2] A traditional samovar consists of a large metal container with a tap near the bottom and a metal pipe running vertically through the middle. The pipe is filled with solid fuel which is ignited to heat the water in the surrounding container. A small (6 to 8\u00a0inch/15 to 20\u00a0cm) smoke-stack is put on the top to ensure draft. After the water boils and the fire is extinguished, the smoke-stack can be removed and a teapot placed on top to be heated by the rising hot air. The teapot is used to brew a strong concentrate of tea known as zavarka (\u0437\u0430\u0432\u0430\u0440\u043a\u0430). The tea is served by diluting this concentrate with boiled water from the main container, usually at a water-to-tea ratio of 10-to-1, although tastes vary.[citation needed] The origin and history of the samovar prior to the 18th century is unknown.\nConnections exist to a similar Greek water-heater of classical antiquity, the autepsa, a vase with a central tube for coal. \nThe Russian tradition was probably influenced by Byzantine and Central Asian cultures.[3] Conversely, Russian culture also influenced Asian, Western European and Byzantine cultures. \n\"Samovar-like\" pottery found in Shaki, Azerbaijan in 1989 was estimated to be at least 3,600 years old. While it differed from modern samovars in many respects, it contained the distinguishing functional feature of an inner cylindrical tube that increased the area available for heating the water. Unlike modern samovars, the tube was not closed from below, and so the device relied on an external fire (i.e. by placing it above the flame) instead of carrying its fuel and fire internally.[4] The first historically recorded samovar-makers were the Russian Lisitsyn brothers, Ivan Fyodorovich and Nazar Fyodorovich. From their childhood they were engaged in metalworking at the brass factory of their father, Fyodor Ivanovich Lisitsyn. In 1778 they made a samovar, and the same year Nazar Lisitsyn registered the first samovar-making factory in Russia. They may not have been the inventors of the samovar, but they were the first documented samovar-makers, and their various and beautiful samovar designs became very influential throughout the later history of samovar-making.[5][6] \nThese and other early producers lived in Tula, a city known for its metalworkers and arms-makers. Since the 18th century Tula has been also the main center of Russian samovar production, with tul'sky samovar being the brand mark of the city. A Russian saying equivalent to \"carrying coal to Newcastle\" is \"to travel to Tula with one's own samovar\". Although Central Russia and the Ural region were among the first Samovar producers, over time several samovar producers emerged all over Russia, which gave the samovar its different local characteristics.[7] By the 19th century samovars were already a common feature of Russian tea culture. They were produced in large numbers and exported to Central Asia and other regions. The samovar was an important attribute of Russian households and taverns to tea-drinking. It was used by all classes, from the poorest peasants up to the most well-suited people.[8][9] The Russian expression \"to have a sit by the samovar\" means to have a leisurely talk while drinking tea from a samovar. In everyday use samovars were an economical permanent source of hot water in older times. Various slow-burning items could be used for fuel, such as charcoal or dry pinecones. When not in use, the fire in the samovar pipe faintly smouldered. As needed it could be quickly rekindled with the help of bellows. Although a Russian jackboot \u0441\u0430\u043f\u043e\u0433 (sapog) could be used for this purpose, bellows were manufactured specifically for use on samovars.[10] Today samovars are popular souvenirs among tourists in Russia.[11] The Russian word was adopted as  Persian: \u0633\u0645\u0627\u0648\u0631 samovar, and Turkish: semaver. Samovar culture has an analog in Iran and is maintained by expatriates around the world. In Iran, samovars have been used for at least two centuries (roughly since the era of close political and ethnic contact between Russia and Iran started), and electrical, oil-burning or natural gas-consuming samovars are still common. Samovar is sam\u0103var in Persian. Iranian craftsmen used Persian art motifs in their samovar production. The Iranian city of Borujerd has been the main centre of samovar production and a few workshops still produce hand-made samovars. Borujerd's samovars are often made with German silver, in keeping with the famous Varsho-Sazi artistic style. The art samovars of Borujerd are often displayed in Iranian and Western museums as illustrations of Iranian art and handicraft.[12] Kashmiri samovars are made of copper with engraved or embossed calligraphic motifs. In fact in Kashmir, there were two variants of samovar. The copper samovar was used by Muslims and that of brass was used by local Hindus called Kashmiri Pandit. The brass samovars were nickel-plated inside.[13] Inside a samovar there is a fire-container in which charcoal and live coals are placed. Around the fire-container there is a space for water to boil. Green tea leaves, salt, cardamom, and cinnamon are put into the water.[14] Turkish samovars are popular souvenirs among tourists, and charcoal burning samovars are still popular in the fields.  However, in the modern homes they have been replaced with the \u00e7aydanl\u0131k (lit. \"teapot\"), a metal teapot with a smaller teapot on top taking the place of the cap of the lower one.  To make Turkish tea, the lower part is used to boil the water and the upper part, called demlik is used for concentrated tea.  Tea is poured first from the demlik and then diluted to the desired level with plain boiling water from the lower tea kettle.  The body is traditionally made of brass or copper, occasionally also silver or gold, but \u00e7aydanl\u0131k are now also made from stainless steel, aluminium, or ceramics with plastic, steel or aluminium handles.",
    "Tehri": " New Tehri is a city and a municipal board in Tehri Garhwal District in the Indian state of Uttarakhand. It is the administrative headquarters of Tehri Garhwal District. This urban municipality area has 11 wards, from Vidhi Vihar to Vishwakarma Puram (Koti colony). Seema Krishali is the chairperson of Nagar Palika Tehri, and is the first female chairperson of Tehri. She won as an independent. Tehri is represented by the Tehri assembly seat of Uttarakhand and the Tehri Lok Sabha seat of India, which are represented by Dhan Singh Negi (Bhartiya Janta Party) and Mala Rajya Laxmi Shah (Bhartiya Janta Party) respectively.[2] The old town of Tehri sat at the confluence of the Bhagirathi and Bhilangna rivers. It was formerly known as Ganeshprayag. It adjoined the district of Garhwal, and its topographical features were similar. It contained the sources of both the Ganges and the Yamuna, which are visited by thousands of Hindu pilgrims.[3] Construction of the Tehri Dam totally submerged the old town of Tehri, and the population was shifted to the town of New Tehri. The town is famous as the site of protests against the dam by Sundarlal Bahuguna and his followers during the Chipko movement. At present the old Tehri town does not exist any longer.[4] As of 2011[update] India census,[5] Tehri had a population of 24,014. Males constitute 65% of the population and females 35%. Tehri has an average literacy rate of 78%, higher than the national average of 74%: male literacy is 81%, and female literacy is 71%. In Tehri, 10% of the population is under 6 years of age. The most visited places that are actively maintained are Devi Kunjapuri Temple, Chandrabadani Devi, Shri Adinath Digambar Jain Mandir, Mahasar Taal, Sehstra Taal, and Khatling Glacier. Some areas of Tehri are view-able but neglected by the Uttrakhand government, including Panwali Kantha, Belhbagi Bugyal, and Khait parvat. Panwali Kantha is one of the most popular treks in Uttarakhand which is listed by Outlook Traveller in their write-up. These places have the potential to attract tourists for trekking and mountaineering.[citation needed] The new district headquarters at New Tehri can be looked at as a future tourist spot[citation needed] where views of Tehri Lake can be seen. Dobra Chanti Bridge is one of the major tourist attraction due to the lightening work. It is India's longest motorable single lane suspension bridge with 440 meter long way from Dobra to Chanti. Located in the proximity of Tehri Garhwal, Narendranagar is a tourist attraction where visitors can see the River Ganga and Doon valley.[citation needed] The major highway that links New Tehri is National Highway 34. It is very well connected to major Uttarakhand cities Dehradun, Rishikesh. It is 99\u00a0km from Dehradun and 75\u00a0km from Rishikesh. Nearest railway station is Rishikesh Railway Station which is 71\u00a0km from New Tehri. Rishikesh is well connected to major cities of India. Nearest airport is Dehradun Airport in Dehradun, which is 76\u00a0km from New Tehri. Letitia Elizabeth Landon's poetical illustration on Davis Cox's picture 'The Grass-Rope Bridge at Teree, in the Province of Gurwall', refers back to the time when the hill country of this province was resorted to for recuperation by Europeans suffering from the heat of the plains.[6]",
    "Bakarkhani": " Bakarkhani or Baqarkhani or Bakorkhoni also known as bakarkhani roti, is a thick, spiced flat-bread that is part of the Mughlai cuisine.[4] Bakarkhani is prepared on certain Muslim religious festivals in South Asia and is now popular as sweet bread.[5] Bakarkhani is almost biscuit-like in texture, with a hard crust. The chief ingredients are flour, semolina, sugar, molasses soaked in saffron, poppy or nigella seeds, salt, and ghee (clarified butter). A legend attributes the bread's name to Mirza Agha Baqer, a son-in-law of Murshid Quli Khan II.[6] According to the legend, Baqer, a general based in Chittagong under Nawab Siraj ud-Daulah of Bengal, falls in love with a dancer called Khani Begum from Arambagh, who was also eyed by Zaynul Khan, the city's kotwal and the son of a wazir. Zaynul attempts to attack Khani for rejecting him, and Baker intervenes, defeating Zaynul in a swordfight. Zaynul 's two companions go and lie to his father, the wazir, telling him that Baker has killed Zaynul. Out of fury, the wazir orders them to put Baker inside a cage with a tiger. Baker kills the tiger and at the same time, the claim of Zaynul's death is found to be false. The wazir, Jahandar Khan, and his son Zaynul then kidnap Khani and set off for South Bengal. The battle continues there as Baker arrives to rescue Khani. In another brawl of talwars, Jahandar accidentally kills Zaynul, after Zaynul inadvertently murders Khani. Khani is later buried in Bakla-Chandradwip (Patuakhali-Barisal). Baker Khan builds a tomb over her grave and Bakla-Chandradwip would be renamed Bakerganj after him.[7] Baker was already familiar with this area as he was a jagirdar in Barisal's Salimabad and Umedpur parganas.[8] The tragic love story of Baker Khan and Khani Begum inspired the bakers to name his favourite bread Bakerkhani.[9][10] Dhaka's first bakarkhani shop opened in close proximity to Lalbagh Fort and many of the city's bakarkhani sellers originate from the Sylhet Division.[11] The Bengal Subah, specifically Mughal Dhaka, was a hub for merchants from all parts of the subcontinent and even as far as the Middle East and Armenia. Through trade and travel, the bakarkhani became popular outside of Bengal in places such as Kashmir, Bihar, Lucknow and Hyderabad.[12] Bakarkhani is popular in the regions of Pakistan,[4] India,[13] Bangladesh, Afghanistan and Russia.[14] Utsa Ray, a culinary historian, described Bakarkhani as the \"pride\" of the \"gastronomic culture of Dhaka\"[15] and according to other scholars, \"Bakorkhoni gives Old Dhaka a unique and distinct culinary identity\".[16] According to Hakim Habibur Rahman, Bakorkhoni could not be found in anywhere else than Dhaka during the colonial period.[15] Bakarkhani is made by kneading together flour, ghee, in some cases cardamom, sugar and salt with water. The dough is then flattened. The bread is made by stretching a sheet of dough repeatedly and interleaving with ghee, molasses, saffron water, poppy or nigella seeds before baking on a tandoor or tawa girdle. It is also known as shukha (meaning 'dry') naan or shukha roti due to its dry texture.[6] Hakim Habibur Rahman, author of Dhaka Panchas Baras Pahle, lists three variations of bakarkhani; Gao-joban, shuki (shukha) and nimshuki. There are also other variations such as kaicha-ruti, mulam and chinshuki.[7] Outside of Dhaka, different types of Bakarkhani are eaten across the country. The Bakarkhani of Sylhet and Chittagong resemble a sweet and syrupy porota,[17] whilst the Bakarkhani of Dinajpur is thick and doughy and often contains pieces of morobba.[18] There is also a Kashmiri variant of bakarkhani[19] which is a thinner variety, similar to round naan in appearance, but crisp and layered, and sprinkled with sesame seeds.[20] It is typically consumed hot, during breakfast, often with noon chai.[21] Bakarkhani is mentioned in lines of a Bengali poem by Pratul Mukhopadhyay: \u2018\u0986\u09b2\u09c1 \u09ac\u09c7\u099a\u09cb, \u099b\u09cb\u09b2\u09be \u09ac\u09c7\u099a\u09cb, \u09ac\u09c7\u099a\u09cb \u09ac\u09be\u0995\u09b0\u0996\u09be\u09a8\u09bf\n\u09ac\u09c7\u099a\u09cb \u09a8\u09be \u09ac\u09c7\u099a\u09cb \u09a8\u09be \u09ac\u09a8\u09cd\u09a7\u09c1 \u09a4\u09cb\u09ae\u09be\u09b0 \u099a\u09cb\u0996\u09c7\u09b0 \u09ae\u09a3\u09bf\u0964[22] Sell potatoes, sell gram, sell Bakarkhani\nDon't sell, don't sell, friend, the jewel in your eye."
