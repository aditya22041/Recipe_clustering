{"Gulab Jamun or Kala Jam (Waffle Balls)": " Gulab jamun (also spelled gulaab jamun; lit.\u2009'Rose water berry' or 'Rose berry') is a sweet confectionary or dessert, originating in the Indian subcontinent and a type of mithai popular in India, Pakistan, Nepal, the Maldives and Bangladesh, as well as Myanmar. It is also common in nations with substantial populations of people with South Asian heritage, such as Mauritius, Fiji, Gulf states, the Malay Peninsula, Great Britain, South Africa, and the Caribbean countries of Jamaica, Trinidad and Tobago, Guyana, and Suriname. It is made mainly from milk solids, traditionally from khoya, which is milk reduced to the consistency of a soft dough. Modern recipes call for dried or powdered milk instead of khoya. It is often garnished with dried nuts, such as almonds and cashews, to enhance flavour. In the Indian subcontinent, milk and cheese solids are prepared by heating milk over a low flame until the water content has evaporated and only the milk solids, known as khoya, remain. The solids are kneaded with flour (maida), and small balls of this dough are deep-fried in oil or ghee (clarified butter) at a low temperature,[1] then soaked in a light sugar syrup flavored with green cardamom and rose water, kewra or saffron.[2] Hot gulab jamun is often served with vanilla ice cream, or kulfi. According to culinary historian Michael Krondl, 12th century Manasollasa mentions a recipe for fried fritter balls made of chenna cheese and rice flour and was soaked in cardamom-scented syrup, but this recipe did not use rosewater (gulab) syrup.[3][4] The 13th century Arab dessert luqmat al-qadi is similar in appearance to gulab jamun, although it is made of entirely different batter than gulab jamun but was soaked in rosewater-scented (gulab) syrup, the only Persian connection may be the common use of rosewater syrup.[5] Gulab Jamun emerged in medieval India during the Islamic period, blending Persianate influence with local influences that eventually became gulab jamun.[6]  The word \"gulab\" is derived from the Persian words gul (flower) and \u0101b (water), referring to the rose water-scented syrup, and \"Jamun\" or \"jaman\" is the Hindi word for Syzygium jambolanum, an Indian fruit with a similar size and shape, commonly known as black plum.[7] Jamun is also defined as a fried delicacy in sugar syrup.[8] Gulab jamun is often eaten at festivals, birthdays or major celebrations such as marriages, the Muslim celebrations of Eid ul-Fitr and Eid al-Adha, and the Hindu festivals of Diwali and Ganesh Chaturthi. There are various types of gulab jamun. Gulab jamun gets its brownish red colour because of the sugar content in the milk powder (khoya). In other types of gulab jamun, sugar is added in the batter, and after frying, the sugar caramelization gives it its dark, almost black colour, which is then called kala jamun or \"black jamun\". The sugar syrup may be replaced with (slightly) diluted maple syrup for a gulab jamun. Homemade gulab jamun is usually made up of khoya, a pinch of all-purpose flour/refined wheat flour/ wheat flour (optional), baking powder and clarified butter (ghee); milk kneaded to form a dough, moulded into balls, deep fried and dropped into simmering sugar syrup. In Bengali, Gulab Jamun is known as Kalo Jam or Pantua, which is similar to gulab jamun, and could be called a Bengali variant of that dish.[9] Ledikeni, a variation of Pantua, is another variant of gulab jamun.[10] It is said[by whom?] to have been invented by Bhim Chandra Nag on the occasion of a visit by Lady Canning, the wife of Charles Canning, the Governor-General of India during 1856\u201362. Katangi, a town near Jabalpur is famous for \"Jhurre Ka Rasgulla\", which has been made there for the past 100 years.[11][12] It is several times the size of normal gulab jamuns and is prepared in local desi ghee.[13] In Rajasthan, instead of soaking gulab jamun balls in sugar syrup, they are cooked in gravy made from spices, nuts and tomato to make popular Gulab Jamun ki Sabzi. In Western Madhya Pradesh and Malwa, Mawa Bati is populer as local version of Gulab Jamun. It is different than Gulab jamun by size, fillings and amount of sweetness, Mawa bati is usually not immersed in Sugar syrup and slightly larger than Gulab Jamun.[14] In Bangladesh, Pantua is available almost everywhere throughout the country, which can be referred to a Bengali variation of Gulab jamun. Also there are two kinds of jamuns that are famous. They are Golap Jam (\u0997\u09cb\u09b2\u09be\u09aa \u099c\u09be\u09ae) and Kalo Jam (\u0995\u09be\u09b2\u09cb \u099c\u09be\u09ae). The sweet is known as Lal Mohan (\u0932\u093e\u0932\u092e\u094b\u0939\u0928) in Nepali language and is available at almost every sweet shop. The sale of the sweet usually increases significantly during festivals such as Tihar, Dashain, etc.[15] Hot, cold or at room temperature", "Prawn Malai Curry": "Chingri malai curry or malai chingri, also known as prawn malai curry, is a Bengali curry made from tiger (bagda) and king prawns (chingri) and coconut milk and flavoured with spices.[1] The dish is popular throughout Bengal[2][3] and is served during weddings and celebrations, or for guests,[4] and was also very popular among the British in Calcutta.[5] It is a really popular dish from Cox's Bazar. Hot", "Curry": "  Curry is a dish with a sauce or gravy seasoned with spices, mainly associated with South Asian cuisine.[1] It is not to be confused with leaves from the curry tree, although some curries do include curry leaves.[2][3] Curry is prepared in the native cuisines of many Southeast Asian and East Asian countries.[1][4] There are many varieties of curry. The choice of spices for each dish in traditional cuisine depends on regional cultural traditions and personal preferences.[1] Such dishes have names that refer to their ingredients, spicing, and cooking methods.[5] Outside the Indian subcontinent, a curry is a dish from Southeast Asia which uses coconut milk or spice pastes and is commonly eaten over rice.[4] Curries may contain fish, meat, poultry, or shellfish, either alone or in combination with vegetables. Others are vegetarian. A masala mixture is a combination of dried or dry-roasted spices commonly homemade for some curries.[1] Dry curries are cooked using small amounts of liquid, which is allowed to evaporate, leaving the other ingredients coated with the spice mixture. Wet curries contain significant amounts of sauce or gravy based on broth, coconut cream or coconut milk, dairy cream or yogurt, or legume pur\u00e9e, saut\u00e9ed crushed onion, or tomato pur\u00e9e.[1] Curry powder, a commercially prepared mixture of spices marketed in the West, was first exported to Britain in the 18th century when Indian merchants sold a concoction of spices, similar to garam masala, to the British East India Company returning to Britain.[1] Curry is an anglicised form of the Tamil \u0b95\u0bb1\u0bbf ka\u1e5fi meaning 'sauce' or 'relish for rice' that uses the leaves of the curry tree (Murraya koenigii).[6][self-published source?][7][8][9] The word kari is also used in other Dravidian languages, namely in Malayalam, Kannada and Kodava with the meaning of \"vegetables (or meat) of any kind (raw or boiled), curry\".[10] Ka\u1e5fi is described in a mid-17th century Portuguese cookbook by members of the British East India Company,[11] who were trading with Tamil merchants along the Coromandel Coast of southeast India,[12] becoming known as a \"spice blend ... called kari podi or curry powder\".[12] The first appearance in its anglicised form (spelled currey) was in Hannah Glasse's 1747 book The Art of Cookery Made Plain and Easy.[7][11] The word cury in the 1390s English cookbook, The Forme of Cury,[11] is unrelated, coming from the Middle French word cuire, meaning 'to cook'.[13] Evidence has been found that Austronesian merchants in South East Asia traded spices along marine trade routes between South Asia (primarily the ports on the south eastern coast of India and Sri Lanka) and East Asia as far back at 5000 BCE.[14][15][16] Archaeological evidence dating to 2600 BCE from Mohenjo-daro also suggests the use of mortar and pestle to pound spices including mustard, fennel, cumin, and tamarind  pods with which they flavoured food.[17] Black pepper is native to the Indian subcontinent and Southeast Asia and has been known to Indian cooking since at least 2000 BCE.[18] The three basic ingredients of the spicy stew were ginger, garlic, and turmeric. Using a method called \"starch grain analysis\", archaeologists identified the residue of these spices in both skeletons and pottery shards from excavations in India, finding that turmeric and ginger were present.[19][20] The establishment of the Mughal Empire, in the early 16th century, also influenced some curries, especially in the north. Another influence was the establishment of the Portuguese trading centre in Goa in 1510, resulting in the introduction of chili pepper, tomatoes and potatoes to India from the Americas, as a byproduct of the Columbian Exchange.[21] The British lumped all sauce-based dishes under the generic name 'curry'.[5][22] It was introduced to English cuisine from Anglo-Indian cooking in the 17th century, as spicy sauces were added to plain boiled and cooked meats.[23] Curry was first served in coffee houses in Britain from 1809, and has been increasingly popular in Great Britain, with major jumps in the 1940s and the 1970s.[24] During the 19th century, curry was carried to the Caribbean by Indian indentured workers in the British sugar industry. Since the mid-20th century, curries of many national styles have become popular far from their origins, and increasingly become part of international fusion cuisine.[25] India is the home of curry, and many Indian dishes are curry-based, prepared by adding different types of vegetables, lentils, or meats. The content of the curry and style of preparation vary by region. Most curries are water-based, with occasional use of dairy and coconut milk. Curry dishes are usually thick and spicy and are eaten along with steamed rice and a variety of Indian breads. The popular rogan josh, for example, from Kashmiri cuisine, is a wet curry of lamb with a red gravy coloured by Kashmiri chillies and an extract of the red flowers of the cockscomb plant (mawal).[26] Goshtaba (large lamb meatballs cooked in yoghurt gravy) is another curry dish from the Wazwan tradition occasionally found in Western restaurants.[27] Curries in Bengali cuisine include seafood and fresh fish. Mustard seeds and mustard oil are added to many recipes, as are poppy seeds. Emigrants from the Sylhet district of Bangladesh founded the curry house industry in Britain, while in Sylhet some restaurants run by expatriates specialise in British-style Indian food.[28] Rice and curry is the staple dish of Sri Lanka.[29] Curry spread to other regions of Asia. Although not an integral part of Chinese cuisine, curry powder is added to some dishes in the southern part of China. The curry powder sold in Chinese grocery stores is similar to Madras curry powder but with addition of star anise and cinnamon.[30] The former Portuguese colony of Macau has its own culinary traditions and curry dishes, including Galinha \u00e0 portuguesa and curry crab. Portuguese sauce is a sauce flavoured with curry and thickened with coconut milk.[31] Japanese curry is usually eaten as kar\u0113 raisu \u2013 curry, rice, and often pickled vegetables, served on the same plate and eaten with a spoon, a common lunchtime canteen dish. It is less spicy and seasoned than Indian and Southeast Asian curries, being more of a thick stew than a curry. British people brought curry from the Indian colony back to Britain[32] and introduced it to Japan during the Meiji period (1868 to 1912), after Japan ended its policy of national self-isolation (sakoku), and curry in Japan was categorised as a Western dish.[33] Its spread across the country is attributed to its use in the Japanese Army and Navy which adopted it extensively as convenient field and naval canteen cooking, allowing even conscripts from the remotest countryside to experience the dish. The Japan Maritime Self-Defense Force traditionally have curry every Friday for lunch and many ships have their own recipes.[34] The standard Japanese curry contains onions, carrots, potatoes, and sometimes celery, and a meat that is cooked in a large pot. Sometimes grated apples or honey are added for additional sweetness and other vegetables are sometimes used instead.[35] Curry was popularized in Korean cuisine when Ottogi entered the Korean food industry with a curry powder in 1969.[36][37] Korean curry, usually served with rice, is characterized by the golden yellow colour of turmeric. Curry tteokbokki is made of tteok (rice cakes), eomuk (fish cakes), eggs, vegetables, and curry. Curry can be added to Korean dishes such as bokkeumbap (fried rice), sundubujjigae (silken tofu stew), fried chicken, vegetable stir-fries, and salads. Indian Indonesian cuisine consists of adaptations of authentic dishes from India, as well as original creations inspired by the diverse food culture of Indonesia. Curry in Indonesian is kari and in Javanese is kare. In Indonesian cuisine especially in Bandung, there is a dish called lontong kari, a combined of lontong and beef yellow curry soup.[38] In Javanese cuisine, kare rajungan, blue swimmer crab curry has become a delicacy of Tuban Regency, East Java.[39] Rendang, the national dish of Indonesia, which is originated from Minang, is drier and contains mostly meat and more coconut milk than a conventional Malaysian curry; it was mentioned in Malay literature in the 1550s by Hikayat Amir Hamzah.[40] Malaysian cuisine may have initially incorporated curries via the Indian population, but it has become a staple among the Malay and Chinese populations there. Malaysian curries typically use turmeric-rich curry powders, coconut milk, shallots, ginger, belacan (shrimp paste), chili peppers, and garlic. Tamarind is also often used. In Burmese cuisine, curries are broadly called hin. Burmese curries generally consist of protein that is simmered in a curry base of aromatics including shallots, onions, ginger, and garlic, alongside dried spices like turmeric, paprika, and garam masala. Burmese curries generally differ from other Southeast Asian curries in that dried spices are also used commonly to season the dishes, while coconut milk is only used sparingly for select dishes. In the Philippines, two kinds of curry traditions are seen corresponding with the cultural divide between the Hispanicised north and Indianised/Islamised south. In the northern areas, a linear range of new curry recipes could be seen. The most common is a variant of the native ginataang manok (chicken cooked in coconut milk) dish with the addition of curry powder, known as the \"Filipino chicken curry\". This is the usual curry dish that northern Filipinos are familiar with. Similarly, other northern Filipino dishes that can be considered \"curries\" are usually ginataan (cooked with coconut milk) variants of other native meat or seafood dishes such as adobo, kaldereta, and mechado, that simply add curry powder or non-native Indian spices.[41] In Thai cuisine, curries are called kaeng, and usually consist of meat, fish or vegetables in a sauce based on a paste made from chilies, onions or shallots, garlic, and shrimp paste.[42] Additional spices and herbs define the type of curry. Local ingredients, such as chili peppers, kaffir lime leaves, lemongrass, galangal are used and, in central and southern Thai cuisine, coconut milk. Northern and northeastern Thai curries generally do not contain coconut milk. Due to the use of sugar and coconut milk, Thai curries tend to be sweeter than Indian curries. In the West, some of the Thai curries are described by colour; red curries use red chilies while green curries use green chilies. Yellow curry\u2014called kaeng kari (by various spellings) in Thai, of which a literal translation could be \"curry soup\"\u2014is more similar to Indian curries, with the use of turmeric, cumin, and other dried spices. A few stir-fried Thai dishes also use an Indian style curry powder (Thai: phong kari). In Vietnamese cuisine, it is known as c\u00e0 ri and is made of ingredients such as coconut milk, potatoes, sweet potatoes, taro, and chicken, along with coriander and green onions. This dish is more like soup than Indian curry. Goat meat curry is also available, but only in a few special restaurants in Vietnam. Curry is often served with bread, vermicelli or rice. Curry is considered a dish in the south. The other ingredients of the curry are very diverse, depending on the meat ingredients, the main fruit for cooking curry as well as the chef's creativity. Vietnamese curries are also made with coconut milk, red cashew, onions, ginger, potatoes, sweet potatoes, carrots, radishes, vegetables, and various types of meat.[citation needed] Consumption of curry spread to South Africa with the migration of people from the Indian subcontinent to the region in the colonial era. African curries, Cape Malay curries and Natal curries include the traditional Natal curry, the Durban curry, Bunny chow, and roti rolls. South African curries appear to have been founded in both KwaZulu-Natal and the Western Cape, while other curries developed across the country over the late 20th century and early 21st century to include ekasi, coloured, and Afrikaner curries.[43] Durban has the largest population of Indians outside of India in the world.[44] Bunny chow or a \"set\", a South African standard, consists of either lamb, chicken or bean curry poured into a tunnelled-out loaf of bread to be eaten with one's fingers by dipping pieces of the bread into it.[43][44] Curry is very popular in the United Kingdom, with a curry house in nearly every town.[45][46] Such is the popularity of curry in the United Kingdom, that it has frequently been called its \"adopted national dish\".[47] It was estimated that in 2016 there were 12,000 curry houses, employing 100,000 people and with annual combined sales of approximately \u00a34.2\u00a0billion.[48] The food offered is Indian food cooked to British taste, but with increasing demand for authentic Indian styles. As of 2015, curry houses accounted for a fifth of the restaurant business in the UK, but, being historically a low wage sector, they were plagued by a shortage of labour. Established Indian immigrants from South Asia were moving on to other occupations; there were difficulties in training Europeans to cook curry; and immigration restrictions, which require payment of a high wage to skilled immigrants, had crimped the supply of new cooks.[49] \"Curry powder\", as available in certain western markets, is a commercial spice blend, and first sold by Indian merchants to European colonial traders. This resulted in the export of a derived version of Indian concoction of spices.[50] and commercially available from the late 18th century,[51][52] with brands such as Crosse & Blackwell and Sharwood's persisting to the present.[53] British traders introduced the powder to Meiji Japan, in the mid-19th century, where it became known as Japanese curry.[54]", "Chicken Curry": "Chicken curry or curry/curried chicken is a South Asian dish originating from the Indian subcontinent. It is common in the cuisine of the Indian subcontinent, Caribbean, Southeast Asia, Great Britain, and Kenya. A typical curry from the Indian subcontinent consists of chicken stewed in an onion- and tomato-based sauce, flavoured with ginger, garlic, tomato puree, chilli peppers and a variety of spices, often including turmeric, cumin, coriander, cinnamon, and cardamom. Outside of South Asia, chicken curry is often made with a pre-made spice mixture known as curry powder. Indian cuisine has a large amount of regional variation, with many variations on the basic chicken curry recipe. Indian chicken curry typically starts with whole spices, heated in oil. A sauce is then made with onions, ginger, garlic, and tomatoes, and powdered spices. Bone-in pieces of chicken are then added to the sauce, and simmered until cooked through.[1] In south India, coconut and curry leaves are also common ingredients.[2] Chicken curry is usually garnished with coriander leaves, and served with rice or roti. In south India, chicken curry may be thickened using coconut milk.[3] This dish was introduced to the Caribbean by indentured Indian workers. At that time, the dish was very similar to the chicken curry dish of India, consisting mostly of sauce with few chicken pieces.[citation needed] However, poultry in Trinidad and Tobago was so readily available that the dish began consisting of mainly chicken, flavored with curry spices. Typical preparation includes seasoning and marinating the chicken meat in a green seasoning consisting of culantro, coriander, French thyme, thyme, scallion, onion, garlic, and peppers. Then the curry is prepared by first adding oil to the pot and then adding and cooking curry powder mixed with water, then the chicken.[4] When the chicken is fried, additional ingredients are added, and the dish is left to cook until finished. It is usually served with bread or beans.[5] Curry chicken and its derivatives are also popular in Suriname, Guyana, Jamaica, Martinique, Saint Lucia and other Caribbean territories with Indo-Caribbean influence. In Southeast Asia, where coconuts, and different spices originated, various native dishes made with coconut milk or curry pastes and eaten with rice are often collectively referred to as \"curries\" in English.[6] Examples of these include Thai gaeng gai, Cambodian kari sach moan (Khmer: \u179f\u17b6\u1785\u17cb\u1798\u17b6\u1793\u17cb) and Filipino ginataang manok. Chicken curries feature prominently in the repertoire of Burmese curries and in Burmese ohn no khao sw\u00e8, a noodle soup of coconut milk and curried chicken.[7][8] However, derivatives of Indian chicken curry may be distinguished because they are relatively modern and are made with curry powder, curry tree leaves, or other Indian spices, like the Filipino chicken curry and the Malaysian chicken curry, although they still use ingredients native to Southeast Asia.[9][10] Country captain chicken is a stewed chicken dish flavored with curry powder, popular in parts of the Southern United States. The Hobson-Jobson Dictionary states the following: COUNTRY-CAPTAIN. This is in Bengal the name of a peculiar dry kind of curry, often served as a breakfast dish. We can only conjecture that it was a favourite dish at the table of the skippers of 'country ships,' who were themselves called 'country captains,' as in our first quotation. In Madras the term is applied to a spatchcock dressed with onions and curry stuff, which is probably the original form. [Riddell says: \"Country-captain.\u2014Cut a fowl in pieces; shred an onion small and fry it brown in butter; sprinkle the fowl with fine salt and curry powder and fry it brown; then put it into a stewpan with a pint of soup; stew it slowly down to a half and serve it with rice\" (Ind. Dom. Econ. 176).] 1792.\u2014\"But now, Sir, a Country Captain is not to be known from an ordinary man, or a Christian, by any certain mark whatever.\" \u2014Madras Courier, April 26. c. 1825.\u2014\"The local name for their business was the 'Country Trade,' the ships were 'Country Ships,' and the masters of them 'Country Captains.' Some of my readers may recall a dish which was often placed before us when dining on board these vessels at Whampoa, viz. 'Country Captain.'\"\u2014The Fankwae at Canton (1882), p. 33.[11] This dish dates back to the early 1800s.[citation needed] A British sea captain stationed in Bengal, India, shared the recipe for this dish with some friends at the major shipping port in Savannah, Georgia.[citation needed] In 1940, Mrs. W.L. Bullard from Warm Springs, Georgia served this dish under the name \"Country Captain\" to Franklin D. Roosevelt and General George S. Patton.[12]", "Biryani": " Biryani (/b\u025c\u02d0r\u02c8j\u0251\u02d0ni/) is a mixed rice dish, mainly popular in South Asia. It is made with rice, some type of meat (chicken, goat, lamb, beef, prawn, or fish) and spices. To cater to vegetarians, in some cases, it is prepared by substituting vegetables or paneer for the meat.[1] Sometimes eggs and/or potatoes are also added.[2] Biryani is one of the most popular dishes in South Asia and among the South Asian diaspora, although the dish is often associated with the region's Muslim population in particular.[3] Similar dishes are also prepared in other parts of the world such as in Iraq, Myanmar, Thailand, and Malaysia.[4] Biryani is the single most-ordered dish on Indian online food ordering and delivery services, and has been labelled as the most popular dish overall in India.[3][5] One theory states that it originated from birinj (Persian: \u0628\u0631\u0646\u062c), the Persian word for rice.[6][7] Another theory states that it is derived from biryan or beriyan (Persian: \u0628\u0631\u06cc\u0627\u0646), which means \"to fry\" or \"to roast\".[8][9] It may alternatively be related to the Persian word bereshtan (Persian: \u0628\u0631\u0634\u062a\u0646) which also means \"to roast (onions)\", as the dish is often prepared by flavouring rice with fried onions and meat, besides mild spices. The exact origin of the dish is uncertain, however, it is speculated to have originated in Iran. In North India, different varieties of biryani developed.[6][10] According to historian Lizzie Collingham, the modern biryani developed in the royal kitchens of the Mughal Empire (1526\u20131857) and is a mix of the native spicy rice dishes of India and the Persian polao.[11] Indian restaurateur Kris Dhillon believes that the dish originated in Persia and was brought to India by the Mughals.[12] Salma Hossein, whom the BBC regards as the \"doyenne of Islamic cooking in India\", shares a similar view, asserting that biryani came to India from Persia even before the Mughal era. Food scholar Pushpesh Pant also challenges the Mughal-origin claim, stating that it originated in Iran and that \"there is no evidence that biryani first came to this land with the Mughals. It is far more probable that it travelled with pilgrims and soldier-statesmen of noble descent to the Deccan region in South India\".[13] Another theory claims that the dish was prepared in India before the first Mughal emperor Babur conquered India.[14] The 16th-century Mughal text Ain-i-Akbari makes no distinction between biryanis and pilaf (or pulao): it states that the word \"biryani\" is of older usage in India.[citation needed][15] A similar theory, that biryani came to India with Timur's invasion, appears to be incorrect because there is no record of biryani having existed in his native land during that period.[14] According to Pratibha Karan, who wrote the book Biryani, biryani is of Mughal origin, derived from pilaf varieties brought to the Indian subcontinent by Arab traders. She speculates that the pulao was an army dish in medieval India. Armies would prepare a one-pot dish of rice with whichever meat was available. Over time, the dish became biryani due to different methods of cooking, with the distinction between \"pulao\" and \"biryani\" being arbitrary.[6][14] According to Vishwanath Shenoy, the owner of a biryani restaurant chain in India, one branch of biryani comes from the Mughals, while another was brought by the Arab traders to Malabar in South India.[16] There are various apocryphal stories dating the invention to Shah Jahan's time but Rana Safvi, the distinguished historian, says she could only find a recipe from the later Mughal period, from Bahadur Shah Zafar's time. It is not her claim that there was no biryani before that; just that she has not found a recipe. Other historians who have gone through texts say that the first references to biryani only appear around the 18th century.[17] Some claim that the dish \"oonchoru\" as mentioned in Sangam literature, which dates from between 200 BCE and 200 CE, is a predecessor of modern biryani. This dish, which was served to the soldiers of the Chera kings in Kerala, was said to be made of rice, ghee, meat, turmeric, coriander, pepper, and bay leaf.[18][19][20] The spices used in the preparation of South Indian biryanis, such as those used in the Malabar variety, are distinctive to the region and the Western Ghats. These spices are not found in the Middle East, Persia, or North India, underscoring the unique culinary heritage and local ingredients of South Indian biryani.[18][19][20] In South India, where rice is more widely used as a staple food, several distinct varieties of biryani emerged from Hyderabad in Telangana, Vijayawada in Andhra Pradesh, Mangalore and Bhatkal in Coastal Karnataka, Thalassery and Kozhikode in Malabar Kerala, as well as Ambur and Chettinad in Tamil Nadu.[6][10] Pilaf or pulao, as it is known on the Indian subcontinent, is another mixed rice dish popular in the cuisines of the Indian subcontinent, Central Asia, and Middle Eastern cuisine. Opinions differ on the differences between pulao and biryani, and whether actually there is a difference between the two.[21] According to Delhi-based historian Sohail Hashmi, pulao tends to be plainer than biryani, and consists of meat or vegetables cooked with rice with the bottom layered with potatoes or onions. Biryani contains more gravy (or yakhni), and is often cooked longer, leaving the meat (and vegetables, if present) more tender, and the rice more flavoured. Biryani is also cooked with additional dressings and often would have a light layer of scorched rice at the bottom.[22] Author Pratibha Karan states that while the terms are often applied arbitrarily, the main distinction is that a biryani consists of two layers of rice with a layer of meat (and vegetables, if present) in the middle, while the pulao is not layered.[14] Author Colleen Taylor Sen lists the following distinctions between biryani and pulao:[23] Ingredients for biryani vary according to the region and the type of meat and vegetables used. Meat (chicken, goat, beef, lamb,[26] prawn or fish) is the prime ingredient with rice. As is common in dishes of the Indian subcontinent, vegetables are sometimes also used when preparing biryani. Corn may be used, depending on the season and availability. Navratan biryani tends to use sweeter, richer ingredients such as cashews, sultanas (kismis), and fruits such as apples and pineapples.[22] The spices and condiments used in biryani may include fennel seeds, ghee (clarified butter), nutmeg, mace,[27] pepper, cloves,[27] cardamom, cinnamon, bay leaves, coriander, mint, ginger, onions, tomatoes, green chilies,[26] star anise, and garlic. The premium varieties include saffron.[27] Some commercial recipes for Biryani also include aromatic essences such as Mitha Ittar see attar, kewra and rose water. Dried sour prunes (Alu Bukhara) may also be added to the biryani. In nasi briyani and other variants made in Southeast Asian countries such as Malaysia, Singapore, and Indonesia, typical Southeast Asian spices and aromatics such as pandan leaf may be used alongside typical South Asian spices.[28] The main ingredient that usually accompanies the spices is chicken, lamb or goat meat; special varieties might use beef or seafood instead. The dish may be served with dahi chutney or raita, seekh kebab, korma, curry, a sour dish of aubergine (brinjal), boiled egg, and salad. Biryani can be cooked using one of two styles/techniques, pakki (\"cooked\") and kacchi (\"raw\").[29] There are many types of biryani, whose names are often based on their region of origin. For example, Sindhi biryani developed in the Sindh region of what is now Pakistan, and Hyderabadi biryani developed in the city of Hyderabad in South India. Some have taken the name of the shop that sells it, for example: Haji Biriyani, Haji Nanna Biriyani in Old Dhaka,[30] Fakhruddin Biriyani in Dhaka,[31][32] Students biryani in Karachi, Lucky biryani in Bandra, Mumbai and Baghdadi biryani in Colaba, Mumbai.[22] Biryanis are often specific to the Muslim communities where they originate; they are usually the defining dishes of those communities.[33] Ambur/Vaniyambadi biryani is a variety cooked in the neighboring towns of Ambur and Vaniyambadi in the Tirupattur district of the northeastern part of Tamil Nadu, which has a high Muslim population. It was introduced by the Nawabs of Arcot who once ruled the area. It is typically made with jeera samba rice.[34] The Ambur/Vaniyambadi biryani is accompanied by dhalcha, a sour brinjal curry, and pachadi or raitha (sliced onions mixed with plain yogurt, tomato, chilies, and salt). It has a distinctive aroma and is considered light on the stomach. The usage of spice is moderate, and curd is used as a gravy base. It also has a higher ratio of meat to rice.[15] Ambur-style biriyani is popular as street food all across South India. Beef biryani, as the name implies, uses beef as the meat. In Hyderabad, it is famous as Kalyani biryani, in which buffalo or cow meat is used.[35][36] This meal was started after the Kalyani Nawabs of Bidar came to Hyderabad sometime in the 18th century. The Kalyani biryani is made with small cubes of beef, regular spices, onions, and many tomatoes. It has a distinct tomato, jeera and dhania flavour.[37] In Kerala, beef biryani is well known.[38] This is an integral part of the Navayath cuisine and a specialty of Bhatkal, a coastal town in Karnataka. Its origins are traced to the Persian traders who left behind not only biryani but a variation of kababs and Indian breads. In Bhatkali biryani, the meat is cooked in an onion and green chili-based masala and layered with fragrant rice. It has a unique spicy and heady flavour, and the rice is overwhelmingly white with mild streaks of orange. Its variations include beef, goat, chicken, titar (Partridge), egg, fish, crab, prawn, and vegetable biryani. Though similar to those in Thalassery, this biryani differs with lingering after-notes of mashed onions laced with garlic. A few chilies and spices littered with curry leaves lends a unique flavour to Bhatkal biryani. No oil is used.[39] Bohri biryani, prepared by the Bohris is flavoured with lots of tomatoes.[16] It is popular in Karachi. Chettinad biryani is famous in the Indian state of Tamil Nadu. It is made of jeeraka samba rice, and smells of spices and ghee. It is best taken with nenju elumbu kuzhambu, a spicy and tangy goat meat gravy [citation needed]. The podi kozhi is usually topped with fried onions and curry leaves.[40][41][42][43] Degh ki biryani is a typical biryani made from small cubes of beef or mutton. This biryani is famous in Parbhani and generally served at weddings. The meat is flavoured with ginger, garlic, red chili, cumin, garam masala, fried onion and curd. This biryani is also known as kachay gosht ki biryani or dum biryani, where the meat is marinated and cooked along with short-grained and fine rice. It is left on a slow fire or dum for a fragrant and aromatic flavour. The Delhi version of biryani developed a unique local flavour as the Mughal kings shifted their political capital to the North Indian city of Delhi. Until the 1950s, most people cooked biryani in their home and rarely ate at eateries outside of their homes. Hence, restaurants primarily catered to travellers and merchants. Any region that saw more of these two classes of people nurtured more restaurants, and thus their own versions of biryani. This is the reason why most shops that sold biryani in Delhi, tended to be near mosques such as Jama Masjid (for travellers) or traditional shopping districts (such as Chandni Chowk). Each part of Delhi has its own style of biryani, often based on its original purpose, thus giving rise to Nizamuddin biryani, Shahjahanabad biryani, etc.  Nizamuddin biryani usually had little expensive meat and spices as it was primarily meant to be made in bulk for offering at the Nizamuddin Dargah shrine and thereafter to be distributed to devotees.[22] A non-dum biryani, using many green chillies, popularized by the Babu Shahi Bawarchi shops located outside the National Sports Club in Delhi is informally called Babu Shahi biryani. Another version of Delhi biryani uses achaar (pickles) and is called achaari biryani.[44] The city of Dhaka in Bangladesh is known for selling Chevon Biryani, a dish made with highly seasoned rice and goat meat. The recipe includes: highly seasoned rice, goat meat, mustard oil, garlic, onion, black pepper, saffron, clove, cardamom, cinnamon, salt, lemon, doi, peanuts, cream, raisins and a small amount of cheese (either from cows or buffalo). Haji biryani is a favourite among Bangladeshis living abroad.[45] A recipe was handed down by the founder of one Dhaka restaurant to the next generation. Haji Mohammad Shahed claimed, \"I have never changed anything, not even the amount of salt\".[46] Bengali style biryani often includes potatoes. Dhakaiya Kacchi Biryani is accompanied by borhani, a salted mint drink made of yogurt, coriander, mint and salt. The city of Dindigul in Tamil Nadu is noted for its biryani, which uses a little curd and lemon juice for a tangy taste.[47] Military hotels of Bangalore in Karnataka are known for selling Biryani served in dried plantain leaf bowl called Donne.[48] It is typically made from jeera samba rice, yogurt with lot of common mint and coriander leaves.[49][50] Hyderabadi biryani is India's most famous biryani; some say biryani is synonymous with Hyderabad.[51] Hyderabadi biryani developed under the rule of Asaf Jah I, who was first appointed as the governor of Deccan by the Mughal Emperor Aurangzeb. It is made with basmati rice, spices and goat meat. Popular variations use chicken instead of goat meat. There are various forms of Hyderabadi biryani, such as kachay gosht ki biryani or dum biryani, where goat meat is marinated and cooked along with the rice. It is left on a slow fire or dum for a fragrant and aromatic flavour.[52] Memoni biryani is an extremely spicy variety developed by the Memons of Gujarat-Sindh region in India and Pakistan.[16] It is made with mutton, dahi, fried onions, and potatoes, and fewer tomatoes compared to Sindhi biryani. Kalyani biryani is a typical biryani from the former state of Hyderabad Deccan.[53] Also known as the \"poor man's\"  Hyderabadi biryani, Kalyani biryani is always made from small cubes of buffalo meat. The meat is flavoured with ginger, garlic, turmeric, red chili, cumin, coriander powder, and much onion and tomato. It is first cooked as a thick curry and then cooked along with rice. Then given dum (the Indian method of steaming in a covered pot). Kalyani biryani is supposed to have originated in Bidar during the reign of the Kalyani Nawabs, who migrated to Hyderabad after one of the Nawabs, Ghazanfur Jang married into the Asaf Jahi family uniting their realms. Kalyani biryani was served by the Kalyani Nawabs to all of their subjects who came from Bidar to Hyderabad and stayed or visited their devdi or noble mansion. Calcutta or Kolkata biryani evolved from the Lucknow style when Awadh's last Nawab, Wajid Ali Shah, was exiled in 1856 to the Kolkata suburb of Metiabruz. Shah brought his personal chef with him. The Kolkata biriyani is characterized by the presence of potato in it.[16] A specialty of the Beary Muslim community in coastal Karnataka and is also known as Manglorean-style biryani. The dish is made using lots of green chilly and coconut and has the subtle flavor and aroma of fennel. Spices that include nutmeg, mint leaves, fennel seeds, mace (javitri), poppy seeds, almonds, star anise and others. The rice and meat (mutton, chicken, beef) are cooked separately and then layered and slowly cooked together again. This dish is highly served during marriages and other homely occasions. This type of biryani is popular in the Palakkad and Coimbatore regions. This was most commonly prepared by Rawther families in Kerala and Tamil Nadu. This type of biryani is cooked in a different style. Goat meat is most commonly used and it is entirely different from Malabar biryani.[citation needed] The exotic and aromatic Sindhi biryani is known in Pakistan for its spicy taste, fragrant rice, and delicate meat. Sindhi biryani is a beloved staple in food menus of Pakistani and Sindhi cuisine. Sindhi biryani is prepared with meat and a mixture of basmati rice, vegetables, and various spices. Biryani was brought into Sri Lanka by the South Indian Muslims who were trading in the Northern part of Sri Lanka and in Colombo in the early 1900s.[citation needed] In Sri Lanka, it is Buryani, a colloquial word which generated from Buhari Biryani. In many cases, Sri Lankan biryani is much spicier than most Indian varieties. Side dishes may include acchar, Malay pickle, cashew curry and mint sambol.[citation needed] Thalassery biryani is the variation of biryani found in the Indian state of Kerala. It is one of the many dishes of the Kerala Muslim community, and very popular.[54] The ingredients are chicken, spices and the specialty is the choice of rice called khyma. Khyma rice is generally mixed with ghee. Although a large number of spices such as mace, cashew nuts, sultana raisins, fennel-cumin seeds, tomato, onion, ginger, garlic, shallot, cloves and cinnamon are used,[55] there is only a small amount of chili (or chili powder) used in its preparation. A pakki biryani, the Thalassery biryani uses a small-grained thin (not round) fragrant variety of rice known as khyma or jeerakasala. The dum method of preparation (sealing the lid with dough [maida] or cloth and placing red-hot charcoal above the lid) is applied here to avoid scorched rice. In Myanmar (Burma), biryani is known in Burmese as danpauk or danbauk (\u1012\u1036\u1015\u1031\u102b\u1000\u103a), derived from the Persian term dum pukht, which refers to a slow oven cooking technique. Danbauk is a mainstay at festive events such as Thingyan, weddings and donation feasts.[56][57] Given danbauk's South Asian origins, danbauk restaurants and chains have traditionally been owned by Muslims, but in recent decades Buddhist entrepreneurs have entered the market.[56] Featured ingredients include: cashew nuts, yogurt, raisins and peas, chicken, cloves, cinnamon, saffron and bay leaf cooked in long-grain rice.[58] In danbauk, chicken specially seasoned with a danbauk masala spice mix,[59] is cooked with the rice.[60] Danbauk is typically eaten with a number of side dishes, including a fresh salad of sliced onions, julienned cabbage, sliced cucumbers, fermented limes and lemons, fried dried chilies, and soup.[61] In recent decades, danbauk restaurants have innovated variations, including \"ambrosia\" biryani (\u1014\u1010\u103a\u101e\u102f\u1013\u102c\u1011\u1019\u1004\u103a\u1038), which features dried fruits and buttered rice.[61] In Iraq and in the states of the Persian Gulf, biryani (\u0628\u0631\u064a\u0627\u0646\u064a: \"biryani\") is usually saffron-based with chicken usually being the meat or poultry of choice. It is popular throughout Iraq, especially in the Kurdistan Region.  Most variations also include vermicelli, fried onions, fried potato cubes, almonds, and raisins spread liberally over the rice.[16] Sometimes, a sour/spicy tomato sauce is served on the side (maraq). In Iran, during the Safavid dynasty (1501\u20131736), a dish called Beriyan Polo (Nastaliq script: \u0628\u0631\u06cc\u0627\u0646 \u067e\u0644\u0648) was made with lamb or chicken, marinated overnight\u2014with yogurt, herbs, spices, dried fruits like raisins, prunes or pomegranate seeds\u2014and later cooked in a tannour oven, then served with steamed rice.[citation needed] A different dish called biryan is popular in Afghanistan. Biryan traces its origins to the same source as biryani, and is today sold in Afghanistan as well as in Bhopal, India. Biryan is prepared by cooking gosht and rice together, but without the additional gravy (yakhni) and other condiments that are used in biryani. The Delhi-based historian Sohail Hashmi refers to the biryan as midway between pulao and biryani.  Afghan biryani tends to use much dry fruit such as raisins and lesser amounts of meat, often cut into tiny pieces.[22] Nasi kebuli is an Indonesian spicy steamed rice dish[62] cooked in goat meat broth, milk and ghee.[63] Nasi kebuli is descended from kabuli palaw which is an Afghani rice dish, similar to biryani served in the Indian subcontinent.[64] Although Indonesia has authentic nasi kebuli, Indonesia also inherited and has local-style of biryani which is known as nasi biryani or nasi briyani. Nasi biryani is popular among and often associated as Acehnese, Arab Indonesian, Indian Indonesian and Malay cuisine.[65] The Malaysian and Singaporean variety of biryani is called nasi briyani or nasi biryani. Although authentic styles of biryani from South India are popular, nasi briyani remains the most popular. The key differences between nasi briyani and Indian biryanis are that the meat in nasi briyani is cooked separately from the rice, and there is more curry, sauce, or gravy present in the nasi briyani than in Indian biryanis.[66] Nasi briyani dishes are very popular in Malaysia and Singapore. As an important part of Malaysian and Singaporean Indian cuisines, they are popularized through mamak stalls, hawker centres, and food courts as well as fine dining restaurants. There are also eateries that sell pork as the main meat of the dish in Singapore.[67][68] Biryani dishes are very popular in Mauritius, especially at Muslim weddings and festivities. It is also widely available at street food places. Mauritian biryanis are often accompanied by an achaar (mango pickles), chilies and salads. Kapampangan cuisine of the Philippines (often in Pampanga) features a special dish called nasing biringyi (chicken saffron rice), that is typically prepared only during special occasions such as weddings, family get-togethers or fiestas. It is not a staple of the Filipino diet as it is difficult to prepare compared to other usual dishes. Nasing biringyi is similar to the nasi briyani dish of Malaysia in style and taste. A version that has merged with the Filipino version of the Spanish paella is known as bringhe.[69] In the Cape Malay culture, a variation of biryani incorporates lentils as a key ingredient in the dish along with meat (usually beef, chicken, seafood or vegetables). The dish is made by cooking the rice and legumes and meat and gravy separately, then mixing it. Uncommonly, it is made using the dum-cooking method. The spices are similar to those used in the original Indian biryani. Variants of biryani exist in the cuisines of Somalia, Kenya, and Tanzania due to centuries of trade between the East African coast and South Asia for centuries, and the more recent migration of Indians to the latter two countries more recently during the British colonial era. Zanzibar has its own form of biryani characterized by the mixture of East African and Indian spices, as well as influences from Arab cuisine. The meat used is most commonly chicken.[70] This variant is similar to the forms of biryani served in Kenya. In Somalia, the descendant of biryani is bariis iskukaris. It is served with chicken, goat, beef, lamb, or camel meat, and spiced with the Somali spice mixture xawaash and other spices. A unique characteristic of bariis and other Somali dishes is the addition of banana on the side to be mixed with the dish. Biryani in Thailand is commonly known as khao mhok (Thai: \u0e02\u0e49\u0e32\u0e27\u0e2b\u0e21\u0e01). It is commonly paired with chicken, beef or even fish and topped with fried garlic. The dish is common in Thai cuisine and is often served with a green sour sauce. Tehari and tehri are various names for the vegetarian adaptation of Biryani but are mainly classified as pulao. It was developed for the Hindu bookkeepers of the Muslim Nawabs. It is prepared by adding potatoes to the rice, as opposed to the case of biryani, where the rice is added to the meat. In Kashmir, tehari is sold as street food. Tehari became more popular during World War II, when meat prices increased substantially and potatoes became the popular substitute in biryani. Hot", "Butter Chicken": "Butter chicken, traditionally known as murgh makhani (pronounced [m\u028ar\u0263 \u02c8m\u0259k\u02b0a\u02d0ni]), is an Indian dish originating in Delhi.[1][2] It is a type of curry made from chicken with a spiced tomato and butter (makhan) sauce. Its sauce is known for its rich texture. It is similar to chicken tikka masala, which uses a tomato paste.[6] The curry was developed at the Moti Mahal restaurant in the Daryaganj neighbourhood of Old Delhi in the 1950s, after the Partition of India[7] by Kundan Lal Jaggi and Kundan Lal Gujral,[8] who were both Punjabi refugees from Peshawar.[9][10][2] The curry was made \"by chance\" by mixing leftover tandoori chicken in a tomato gravy, rich in butter (makhan).[11] In 1974, a recipe was published for \"Murgh makhanii (Tandoori chicken cooked in butter and tomato sauce)\".[citation needed] In 1975, the English phrase \"butter chicken\" curry first appeared in print, as a specialty of the house at Gaylord Indian restaurant in Manhattan.[12] In Toronto and the Caribbean, it can be found as a filling in pizza, poutine, wraps, roti, or rolls,[13] while in Australia and New Zealand, it is also eaten as a pie filling.[14][15][16][17] The curry is common in India, Bangladesh, Pakistan, and many other countries where a South Asian diaspora is present.[18][19][13][20][21] Due to its popularity outside of India, it is sometimes mistakenly believed to be of Western origin (like chicken tikka masala, which it is also sometimes confused with).[22] In 2024, the family of Gujral (who run Moti Mahal) sued the family of Jaggi (who run a rival restaurant) in a dispute over credit for inventing the dish.[23] Chicken is marinated for several hours in a mixture of lemon juice, dahi (yogurt), Kashmiri red chili, salt, garam masala, ginger paste, and garlic paste. The marinated chicken is cooked in a tandoor (traditional clay oven), but may be grilled, oven-roasted, or pan-fried. It is served in a mild curry sauce that includes butter. The sauce is a tomato, garlic, and ginger-based sauce that is simmered until smooth and much of the water has evaporated. There are many variations on the composition and spicing of the sauce, which is sieved so that it is velvety smooth. Spices may include cardamom, cumin, cloves, cinnamon, coriander, pepper, garam masala, and fenugreek (Punjabi/Hindi: kasuri methi). Cashew paste may be used as a thickener and it is finally garnished with coriander.", "Chicken Tikka Masala": " Chicken tikka masala is a dish consisting of roasted marinated chicken chunks (chicken tikka) in a spiced sauce. The sauce is usually creamy and orange-coloured. The dish was created by cooks from South Asia living in Great Britain and is offered at restaurants around the world. Chicken tikka masala is composed of chicken tikka, boneless chunks of chicken marinated in spices and yogurt that are roasted in an oven, served in a creamy sauce.[1][2] A tomato and coriander sauce is common, but no recipe for chicken tikka masala is standard; a survey found that of 48 different recipes, the only common ingredient was chicken.[3][4] The sauce usually includes tomatoes (frequently as pur\u00e9e), cream, coconut cream and a masala spice mix. The sauce and chicken pieces may be coloured orange using foodstuffs such as turmeric, paprika, tomato pur\u00e9e or with food dye. Chicken tikka masala is similar to butter chicken, both in the method of creation and appearance.[5] The origin of the dish is not certain, but many sources attribute it to the South Asian community in Great Britain; some sources cite Glasgow as the city of origin.[2][6][7][8] Chicken tikka masala may derive from butter chicken, a popular dish in the northern Indian subcontinent. The Multicultural Handbook of Food, Nutrition and Dietetics credits its creation to Bangladeshi migrant chefs in Britain in the 1960s. They developed and served a number of new inauthentic \"Indian\" dishes, including chicken tikka masala.[9] Historians of ethnic food Peter and Colleen Grove discuss multiple claims regarding the origin of chicken tikka masala, concluding that the dish \"was most certainly invented in Britain, probably by a Bangladeshi chef.\"[10] They suggest that \"the shape of things to come may have been a recipe for Shahi Chicken Masala in Mrs Balbir Singh\u2019s Indian Cookery published in 1961.\"[10] Another claim is that it originated in a restaurant in Glasgow, Scotland.[11][1] This version recounts how a British Pakistani chef, Ali Ahmed Aslam, proprietor of a restaurant in Glasgow, invented chicken tikka masala by improvising a sauce made from a tin of condensed tomato soup, and spices.[12][13][7] Peter Grove challenged any claim that Aslam was the creator of the dish on grounds that the dish was known to exist several years before his restaurant opened.[14] Chef Anita Jaisinghani, a correspondent in the Houston Chronicle, wrote that \"the most likely story is that the modern version was created during the early \u201970s by an enterprising Indian chef near London\" who used Campbell's tomato soup.[15] However, restaurant owner Iqbal Wahhab claims that he and Peter Grove fabricated the story of a chef using tomato soup to create chicken tikka masala  in order \"to entertain journalists\".[16][17][18] Rahul Verma, a food critic who writes for The Hindu,[19] claimed that the dish has its origins in the Punjab region.[20][11] Chicken tikka masala is served in restaurants around the world.[21][22] According to a 2012 survey of 2,000 people in Britain, it was the country's second-most popular foreign dish to cook, after Chinese stir fry.[23] In 2001, British Foreign Secretary Robin Cook mentioned the dish in a speech acclaiming the benefits of Britain's multiculturalism, declaring: Chicken tikka masala is now a true British national dish, not only because it is the most popular, but because it is a perfect illustration of the way Britain absorbs and adapts external influences. Chicken tikka is an Indian dish. The masala sauce was added to satisfy the desire of British people to have their meat served in gravy.[24][25][16][26] Hot", "Spaghetti Bolognese": " Bolognese sauce,[a] known in Italian as rag\u00f9 alla bolognese[b] or rag\u00f9 bolognese (called rag\u00f9 in the city of Bologna, rag\u00f3 in Bolognese dialect), is a meat-based sauce in Italian cuisine, typical of the city of Bologna.[2] It is customarily used to dress tagliatelle al rag\u00f9 and to prepare lasagne alla bolognese. Italian rag\u00f9 alla bolognese is a slowly cooked meat-based sauce, and its preparation involves several techniques, including sweating, saut\u00e9ing and braising. Ingredients include a characteristic soffritto of onion, celery, and carrot, different types of minced or finely chopped beef, often alongside small amounts of fatty pork. White wine, milk, and a small amount of tomato paste or tomato sauce are added, and the dish is then gently simmered at length to produce a thick sauce. Outside Italy, the phrase \"Bolognese sauce\" is often used to refer to a tomato-based sauce to which minced meat has been added; such sauces typically bear little resemblance to Italian rag\u00f9 alla bolognese, being more similar in fact to rag\u00f9 alla napoletana from the tomato-rich south of the country. Although in Italy rag\u00f9 alla bolognese is not used with spaghetti (but rather with flat pasta, such as tagliatelle),[3][4][5] in the United States \"spaghetti bolognese\" has become a popular dish. The origins of the Bolognese rag\u00f9 are related to those of the French ragout, a stew of ingredients reduced to small pieces, which became popular in the 18th century.[6] The earliest documented recipe for a rag\u00f9 served with pasta comes from late 18th century Imola, near Bologna, from Alberto Alvisi, cook of the local Cardinal[7] Barnaba Chiaramonti, later Pope Pius VII. In 1891, Pellegrino Artusi published a recipe for a rag\u00f9 characterized as bolognese in his cookbook.[8] Artusi's recipe, which he called \"maccheroni alla bolognese\", is thought to derive from the mid 19th century when he spent considerable time in Bologna (maccheroni being a generic term for pasta, both dried and fresh[9]). The sauce called for predominantly lean veal filet along with pancetta, butter, onion, and carrot. The meats and vegetables were to be finely minced, cooked with butter until the meats browned, then covered and cooked with broth. No tomatoes were included. Artusi commented that the taste could be made even more pleasant by adding small pieces of dried mushroom, a few slices of truffle, or chicken liver cooked with the meat and diced. As a final touch, he also suggested adding half a glass of cream to the sauce when it was completely done to make it taste even smoother. Artusi recommended serving this sauce with a medium size pasta (\"horse teeth\") made from durum wheat. The pasta was to be made fresh, cooked until it was firm, and then flavored with the sauce and Parmesan cheese.[8] Since Artusi recorded and subsequently published his recipe for maccheroni alla bolognese, what is now rag\u00f9 alla bolognese has evolved with the cuisine of the region. Most notable is the preferred choice of pasta, which today is widely recognized as fresh tagliatelle. Another reflection of the evolution of the cuisine since its inception, is the addition of tomato, either as a puree or as a concentrated paste,[10] to the common mix of ingredients. Similarly, both wine and milk appear today in the list of ingredients in many of the contemporary recipes, and beef has mostly displaced veal as the dominant meat. In 1982, the Italian Academy of Cuisine (Accademia Italiana della Cucina), an organization dedicated to preserving the culinary heritage of Italy, recorded and deposited a recipe for \"classic Bolognese rag\u00f9\" with the Bologna Chamber of Commerce (La Camera di Commercio di Bologna).[11][12][13] A version of the academy's recipe for American kitchens was also published.[7] The academy's recipe confines the ingredients to beef cut from the plate section (cartella di manzo), fresh unsmoked pancetta (pancetta di maiale distesa), onions, carrot, celery, passata di pomodoro (or tomato pur\u00e9e), meat broth, dry white wine, milk, salt and pepper. Nowadays, there are many slight variations of the recipe even among native Italian chefs,[14][15][16] and the repertoire has been further broadened by some American chefs known for their expertise in Italian cuisine.[17] Rag\u00f9 alla bolognese is a complex sauce which involves various cooking techniques, including sweating, saut\u00e9ing and braising. As such, it lends itself well to interpretation and adaptation by professional chefs and home cooks alike. Common sources of differences include which meats to use (beef, pork or veal) and their relative quantities, the possible inclusion of either cured meats or offal, which fats are used in the saut\u00e9 phases (rendered pork fat, butter, olive or vegetable oil), what form of tomato is employed (fresh, canned or paste), the makeup of the cooking liquids (wine, milk, tomato juices, or broth) and their specific sequence of addition. The numerous variations among recipes for rag\u00f9 alla bolognese have led many to search for the definitive, authentic recipe.[18] Some have suggested the recipe registered by the Accademia Italiana della Cucina in 1982 as the \"most authentic\".[19] However, this would be inconsistent with the academy's own beliefs and statements about remaining faithful to tradition in documenting and preserving Italy's culinary heritage.[why?][20][failed verification][21] According to UK cookbook author and food writer Felicity Cloake, \"The fact is that there is no definitive recipe for a bolognese meat sauce, but to be worthy of the name, it should respect the traditions of the area\",[18] a view that is consistent with that often expressed by the Italian Academy of Cuisine. The many variations tend to be based on a common theme. For instance, garlic is absent from all of the recipes mentioned above, as are herbs other than the parsimonious use of bay leaves by some. Seasoning is limited to salt, pepper and the occasional pinch of nutmeg. In all of the recipes, meats dominate as the principal ingredient, while tomatoes, in one form or another, are only an auxiliary ingredient. In Bologna rag\u00f9 is traditionally paired and served with tagliatelle made with eggs and northern Italy's soft wheat flour. Acceptable alternatives to fresh tagliatelle include other broad flat pasta shapes, such as pappardelle or fettuccine, and tube shapes, such as rigatoni and penne.[22] While the combination of the rag\u00f9 with fresh tagliatelle remains the most traditional and authentic in the Bolognese cuisine, some\u2014such as Piero Valdiserra\u2014have argued in favour of capitalizing on its already internationally widespread combination with spaghetti, even by attempting to portray it as not entirely foreign to local tradition.[23] Rag\u00f9 alla bolognese, along with b\u00e9chamel, is also used to prepare traditional baked lasagne in Bolognese style.[14] Spaghetti bolognese, or shortened to \"spag bol\" in the UK, is a popular pasta dish outside Italy, although not part of Italian cuisine.[24][25] The dish is generally perceived as inauthentic by Italians.[4][5][26][27] Spaghetti bolognese consists of spaghetti served with a sauce made from tomatoes, minced beef or other meat, garlic, wine and herbs. In this sense the sauce is actually more similar to Neapolitan rag\u00f9 from the south of Italy than the northern Bolognese version of rag\u00f9. The dish is often served with grated Parmesan on top, but local cheeses, such as grated cheddar are also often used. It may be served with a larger proportion of sauce to pasta than is common in Italian spaghetti dishes. The sauce may be laid on top of the pasta (rather than being mixed in, in the Italian manner) or even served separately from it, leaving diners to mix it in themselves. The origins of the dish are unclear, but it may have evolved in the context of early twentieth-century emigration of southern Italians to the Americas (particularly the United States) as a sort of fusion influenced by the tomato-rich style of Neapolitan rag\u00f9 or it may have developed in immigrant restaurants in Britain in the post war era.[28] The first mention of this combination appeared in the book Practical Italian recipes for American kitchens, written by Julia Lovejoy Cuniberti in 1917, and published to raise funds for the families of Italian soldiers, at the time fighting in World War I. In the book bolognese sauce is recommended for \"macaroni or spaghetti\". The latter were in fact already widespread in the United States, unlike tagliatelle, traditionally made fresh and difficult to export due to the fragility of their consistency.[29] In countries where it is common, the sauce is often used for lasagne in place of rag\u00f9 alla bolognese as in Bologna and elsewhere in Italy.", "Sushi": " Sushi (\u3059\u3057, \u5bff\u53f8, \u9ba8, \u9b93, pronounced [s\u026f\u0255i\ua71c] or [s\u026f\ua71c\u0255i] \u24d8) is a Japanese dish of prepared vinegared rice (\u9ba8\u98ef, sushi-meshi), usually with some sugar and salt,  plus a variety of ingredients (\u306d\u305f, neta), such as vegetables, and any meat, but most commonly seafood (often raw but can be cooked). Styles of sushi and its presentation vary widely, but the one key ingredient is \"sushi rice\", also referred to as shari (\u3057\u3083\u308a), or sumeshi (\u9162\u98ef).[1] The creator of modern sushi is believed to be Hanaya Yohei, who invented nigiri-zushi, a type of sushi most known today, in which seafood is placed on hand-pressed vinegared rice, around 1824 in the Edo period (1603\u20131867). It was the fast food of the ch\u014dnin class in the Edo period.[2][3][4] Sushi is traditionally made with medium-grain white rice, though it can be prepared with brown rice or short-grain rice. It is very often prepared with seafood, such as squid, eel, yellowtail, salmon, tuna or imitation crab meat. Many types of sushi are vegetarian. It is often served with pickled ginger (gari), wasabi, and soy sauce. Daikon radish or pickled daikon (takuan) are popular garnishes for the dish. Sushi is sometimes confused with sashimi, a dish that consists of thinly sliced raw fish or occasionally meat, without sushi rice.[5] A dish known as narezushi (\u99b4\u308c\u5bff\u53f8, \u719f\u5bff\u53f8, \"matured fish\"), stored in fermented rice for possibly months at a time, has been cited as one of the early influences for the Japanese practice of applying rice on raw fish. The fish was fermented with rice vinegar, salt, and rice, after which the rice was discarded.[6] Narezushi is also called honnare, meaning \"fully fermented\", as opposed to namanare, meaning \"partially fermented\", a type of sushi that appeared in the Muromachi period.[7] Fermented fish using rice, such as narezushi, originated in Southeast Asia where it was made to preserve freshwater fish, possibly in the Mekong River basin, which is now Laos, Cambodia, Thailand and Vietnam, and in the Irrawaddy River basin, which is now Myanmar.[7] The first mention of a narezushi-like food is in a Chinese dictionary thought to be from the 4th Century, in this instance referring to salted fish that had been placed in cooked or steamed rice, which caused it to undergo a fermentation process via lactic acid.[8][9] Fermentation methods following similar logic in other Asian rice cultures include burong isda, balao-balao, and tinapayan of the Philippines; pekasam of Indonesia and Malaysia, pla ra (\u0e1b\u0e25\u0e32\u0e23\u0e49\u0e32) of Thailand; sikhae (\uc2dd\ud574) of Korea; and M\u1eafm b\u00f2 h\u00f3c or c\u00e1 chua of Vietnam.[9][6][10][11][12] The lacto-fermentation of the rice prevents the fish from spoiling. When wet-field rice cultivation was introduced during the Yayoi period, lakes and rivers would flood during the rainy season and fish would get caught in the rice paddy fields. Pickling was a way to preserve the excess fish and guarantee food for the following months, and narezushi became an important source of protein for Japanese consumers. The term sushi literally means \"sour-tasting\", as the overall dish has a sour and umami or savory taste. The term comes from an antiquated \u3057 shi terminal-form conjugation, no longer used in other contexts, of the adjectival verb sui (\u9178\u3044, \"to be sour\"),[13] resulting in the term sushi (\u9178\u3057).[14] Narezushi still exists as a regional specialty, notably as funa-zushi from Shiga Prefecture.[15] In the Y\u014dr\u014d Code (\u990a\u8001\u5f8b\u4ee4, Y\u014dr\u014d-ritsury\u014d) of 718, the characters for \"\u9ba8\" and \"\u9b93\" are written as a tribute to the Japanese imperial court, and although there are various theories as to what exactly this food was, it is possible that it referred to narezushi.[16] Until the early 19th century sushi slowly changed and the Japanese cuisine changed as well. The Japanese started eating three meals a day, rice was boiled instead of steamed, and of large importance was the development of rice vinegar.[17] During the Muromachi period (1336\u20131573), the Japanese invented a style of sushi called namanare or namanari (\u751f\u6210\u3001\u306a\u307e\u306a\u308c\u3001\u306a\u307e\u306a\u308a), which means \"partially fermented\". The fermentation period of namanare was shorter than that of the earlier narezushi, and the rice used for fermentation was also eaten with the fish. In other words, with the invention of namanare, sushi changed from a preserved fish food to a food where fish and rice are eaten together. After the appearance of namanare, sake and sake lees were used to shorten fermentation, and vinegar was used in the Edo period.[7] During the Edo period (1603\u20131867), a third type of sushi, haya-zushi (\u65e9\u5bff\u53f8\u3001\u65e9\u305a\u3057, \"fast sushi\"), was developed. Haya-zushi differed from earlier sushi in that instead of lactic fermentation of rice, vinegar, a fermented food, was mixed with rice to give it a sour taste so that it could be eaten at the same time as the fish. Previously, sushi had evolved with a focus on shortening the fermentation period, but with the invention of haya-zushi, which is simply mixed with vinegar, the fermentation process was eliminated and sushi became a fast food. Many types of sushi known in the world today, such as chirashizushi (\u6563\u3089\u3057\u5bff\u53f8, \"scattered sushi\"), inarizushi (\u7a32\u8377\u5bff\u53f8, \"Inari sushi\"), makizushi (\u5dfb\u5bff\u53f8, \"rolled sushi\"), and nigirizushi (\u63e1\u308a\u5bff\u53f8, \"hand-pressed sushi\"), were invented during this period, and they are a type of haya-zushi. Each region utilizes local flavors to produce a variety of sushi that has been passed down for many generations. A 1689 cookbook describes haya-zushi, and a 1728 cookbook describes pouring vinegar over hako-zushi (\u7bb1\u305a\u3057, \"box sushi\") (square sushi made by filling a wooden frame with rice).[7] Today's style of nigirizushi (\u63e1\u308a\u5bff\u53f8, \"hand-pressed sushi\"), consisting of an oblong mound of rice with a slice of fish draped over it, became popular in Edo (contemporary Tokyo) in the 1820s or 1830s. One common story of the origin of nigirizushi is of the chef Hanaya Yohei (1799\u20131858), who invented or perfected the technique in 1824 at his shop in Ry\u014dgoku.[15] The nigirizushi of this period was somewhat different from modern nigirizushi. The sushi rice of this period was about three times the size of today's nigirizushi. The amount of vinegar used was half that of today's sushi, and the type of vinegar developed during this period, called aka-su (\u8d64\u9162, \"red vinegar\"), was made by fermenting sake lees. They also used slightly more salt than in modern times instead of sugar. Seafood served over rice was prepared in a variety of ways. This red vinegar was developed by Nakano Matazaemon (\u4e2d\u91ce \u53c8\u4f50\u885b\u9580), who is the founder of Mizkan, a company that still develops and sells vinegar and other seasonings today.[7] The dish was originally termed Edomae zushi as it used freshly caught fish from the Edo-mae (Edo or Tokyo Bay); the term Edomae nigirizushi is still used today as a by-word for quality sushi, regardless of its ingredients' origins.[18][19] In 1958, Yoshiaki Shiraishi opened the first conveyor belt sushi restaurant (\u56de\u8ee2\u5bff\u53f8, kaiten-zushi) named \"Genroku Zushi\" in Higashi-Osaka. In conveyor belt sushi restaurants, conveyor belts installed along tables and counters in the restaurant transport plates of sushi to customers. Generally, the bill is based on the number of plates, with different colored plates representing the price of the sushi.[20][21][22] When Genroku Sushi opened a restaurant at the Japan World Exposition, Osaka, 1970, it won an award at the expo, and conveyor belt sushi restaurants became known throughout Japan. In 1973, an automatic tea dispenser was developed, which is now used in conveyor belt sushi restaurants today. When the patent for conveyor belt sushi restaurants expired, a chain of conveyor belt sushi restaurants was established, spreading conveyor belt sushi throughout Japan and further popularizing and lowering the price of sushi. By 2021, the conveyor belt sushi market had grown to 700 billion yen and spread outside Japan.[20][21][22] The earliest written mention of sushi in English described in the Oxford English Dictionary is in an 1893 book, A Japanese Interior, where it mentions sushi as \"a roll of cold rice with fish, sea-weed, or some other flavoring\".[23][24] There is an earlier mention of sushi in James Hepburn's Japanese\u2013English dictionary from 1873,[25] and an 1879 article on Japanese cookery in the journal Notes and Queries.[26] Despite common misconception among English speakers, sushi does not mean \"raw seafood.\"[27] The common ingredient in all types of sushi is vinegared sushi rice. Fillings, toppings, condiments, and preparation vary widely.[28] Due to rendaku consonant mutation, sushi is pronounced with zu instead of su when a prefix is attached, as in nigirizushi. Chirashizushi (\u3061\u3089\u3057\u5bff\u53f8, \"scattered sushi\", also referred to as barazushi) serves the rice in a bowl and tops it with a variety of raw fish and vegetable garnishes. It is popular because it is filling, fast, and easy to make.[29] It is eaten annually on Hinamatsuri in March and Kodomonohi in May. Inarizushi (\u7a32\u8377\u5bff\u53f8) is a pouch of fried tofu typically filled with sushi rice alone. According to Shinto lore, inarizushi is named after the god Inari. Foxes, messengers of Inari, are believed to have a fondness for fried tofu and in some regions an Inari-zushi roll has pointed corners that resemble fox ears, thus reinforcing the association.[30]The shape of Inarizushi varies by region. Inarizushi usually has a rectangular shape in Kant\u014d region and a triangle shape in Kansai region.[31] Regional variations include pouches made of a thin omelette (\u5e1b\u7d17\u5bff\u53f8, fukusa-zushi, or \u8336\u5dfe\u5bff\u53f8, chakin-zushi) instead of tofu. It should not be confused with inari maki, a roll filled with flavored fried tofu. Cone sushi is a variant of inarizushi originating in Hawaii that may include green beans, carrots, gobo, or poke along with rice, wrapped in a triangular abura-age piece. It is often sold in okazu-ya (Japanese delis) and as a component of bento boxes.[32][33][34][35] Makizushi (\u5dfb\u304d\u5bff\u53f8, \"rolled sushi\"), norimaki (\u6d77\u82d4\u5dfb\u304d, \"nori roll\", used generically for other dishes as well) or makimono (\u5dfb\u7269, \"variety of rolls\") is a cylindrical piece formed with the help of a mat known as a makisu (\u5dfb\u304d\u7c3e). Makizushi is generally wrapped in nori (seaweed) but is occasionally wrapped in a thin omelette, soy paper, cucumber, or shiso (perilla) leaves. Makizushi is often cut into six or eight pieces, constituting a single roll order. Short-grain white rice is usually used, although short-grain brown rice, like olive oil on nori, is now becoming more widespread among the health-conscious. Rarely, sweet rice is mixed in makizushi rice. Nowadays, the rice in makizushi can be many kinds of black rice, boiled rice, and cereals. Besides the common ingredients listed above, some varieties may include cheese, spicy cooked squid, yakiniku, kamaboko, lunch meat, sausage, bacon or spicy tuna. The nori may be brushed with sesame oil or sprinkled with sesame seeds. In a variation, sliced pieces of makizushi may be lightly fried with egg coating. Below are some common types of makizushi, but many other kinds exist. Narezushi (\u719f\u308c\u5bff\u53f8, \"matured sushi\") is a traditional form of fermented sushi. Skinned and gutted fish are stuffed with salt, placed in a wooden barrel, doused with salt again, then weighed down with a heavy tsukemonoishi (pickling stone). As days pass, water seeps out and is removed. After six months, this sushi can be eaten, remaining edible for another six months or more.[44] The most famous variety of narezushi are the ones offered as a specialty dish of Shiga Prefecture,[45] particularly the funa-zushi made from fish of the crucian carp genus, the authentic version of which calls for the use of nigorobuna, a particular locally differentiated variety of wild goldfish endemic to Lake Biwa.[46]  Nigirizushi (\u63e1\u308a\u5bff\u53f8, \"hand-pressed sushi\") consists of an oblong mound of sushi rice that a chef typically presses between the palms of the hands to form an oval-shaped ball and a topping (the neta) draped over the ball. It is usually served with a bit of wasabi; toppings are typically fish such as salmon, tuna, or other seafood. Certain toppings are typically bound to the rice with a thin strip of nori, most commonly octopus (tako), freshwater eel (unagi), sea eel (anago), squid (ika), and sweet egg (tamago). Gunkanmaki\u00a0[ja] (\u8ecd\u8266\u5dfb, \"warship roll\") is a special type of nigirizushi: an oval, hand-formed clump of sushi rice that has a strip of nori wrapped around its perimeter to form a vessel that is filled with some soft, loose or fine-chopped ingredient that requires the confinement of nori such as roe, natt\u014d, oysters, uni (sea urchin roe), sweetcorn with mayonnaise, scallops, and quail eggs. Gunkan-maki was invented at the Ginza Kyubey restaurant in 1941; its invention significantly expanded the repertoire of soft toppings used in sushi.[47][48] Temarizushi (\u624b\u307e\u308a\u5bff\u53f8, \"ball sushi\") is a style of sushi made by pressing rice and fish into a ball-shaped form by hand using a plastic wrap. Oshizushi (\u62bc\u3057\u5bff\u53f8, \"pressed sushi\"), also known as hako-zushi (\u7bb1\u5bff\u53f8, \"box sushi\"), is a pressed sushi from the Kansai region, a favorite and specialty of Osaka. A block-shaped piece is formed using a wooden mold, called an oshibako. The chef lines the bottom of the oshibako with the toppings, covers them with sushi rice, and then presses the mold's lid to create a compact, rectilinear block. The block is removed from the mold and then cut into bite-sized pieces. Particularly famous is battera (\u30d0\u30c3\u30c6\u30e9, pressed mackerel sushi) or saba zushi (\u9bd6\u5bff\u53f8).[49] In oshizushi, all the ingredients are either cooked or cured, and raw fish is never used.[50] The name battera means \"small boat\" in Portuguese (bateira), as the sushi molds resembled small boats.[51] Oshizushi wrapped in persimmon leaves, a specialty of Nara, is known as kakinohazushi (\u67ff\u306e\u8449\u5bff\u53f8). Seared oshizushi, or aburi oshizushi (\u7099\u308a\u62bc\u3057\u5bff\u53f8), is a popular variety invented in Vancouver, BC in 2008.[52][53][54] This involves using a butane torch to sear the sushi, which may contain ingredients such as mayonnaise, various sauces, jalape\u00f1os, and avocado in addition to typical sushi ingredients such as salmon and mackerel. The variety has since spread to other cities, such as Toronto.[55] The increasing popularity of sushi worldwide has resulted in variations typically found in the Western world but rarely in Japan. A notable exception to this is the use of salmon. The Japanese have eaten salmon since prehistory; however, caught salmon in nature often contains parasites and must be cooked or cured for its lean meat to be edible. On the other side of the world, in the 1960s and 1970s, Norwegian entrepreneurs started experimenting with aquaculture farming. The big breakthrough was when they figured out how to raise salmon in net pens in the sea. Being farm-raised, the Atlantic salmon reportedly showed advantages over the Pacific salmon, such as no parasites, easy animal capture, and could be grown with higher fat content. With government subsidies and improved techniques, they were so successful in raising fatty and parasite-free salmon they ended up with a surplus. Norway has a small population and limited market; therefore, they looked to other countries to export their salmon. The first Norwegian salmon was imported into Japan in 1980, accepted conventionally, for grilling, not for sushi. Salmon had already been consumed in North America as an ingredient in sushi as early as the 1970s.[57][58][59] Salmon sushi did not become widely accepted in Japan until a successful marketing partnership in the late 1980s between Bjorn Eirik Olsen, a Norwegian businessman tasked with helping the Norwegian salmon industry glut, and the Japanese food supplier Nichirei.[60][61][56] Other sushi creations to suit the Western palate were initially fueled by the invention of the California roll, a norimaki which presently almost always uses imitation crab (the original recipe calls for real cooked crab), along with avocado and cucumber.[62] A wide variety of popular rolls (norimaki and uramaki) have evolved since. 'Norway roll' is another variant of uramakizushi filled with tamago (omelette), imitation crab and cucumber, rolled with shiso leaf and nori, topped with slices of Norwegian salmon, garnished with lemon and mayonnaise.[63]  Uramaki (\u88cf\u5dfb, \"inside-out roll\") is a medium-sized cylindrical style of sushi with two or more fillings and was developed as a result of the creation of the California roll, as a method originally meant to hide the nori. Uramaki differs from other makimono because the rice is on the outside and the nori inside. The filling is surrounded by nori, then a layer of rice, and optionally an outer coating of some other ingredients such as roe or toasted sesame seeds. It can be made with different fillings, such as tuna, crab meat, avocado, mayonnaise, cucumber, or carrots. Examples of variations include the rainbow roll (an inside-out topped with thinly sliced maguro, hamachi, ebi, sake and avocado) and the caterpillar roll (an inside-out topped with thinly sliced avocado). Also commonly found is the \"rock and roll\" (an inside-out roll with barbecued freshwater eel and avocado with toasted sesame seeds on the outside). In Japan, uramaki is an uncommon type of makimono; because sushi is traditionally eaten by hand in Japan, the outer layer of rice can be quite difficult to handle with fingers.[64] In Brazil uramaki and other sushi pieces commonly include cream cheese in their recipe. Although unheard of in Japanese sushi, this is the most common sushi ingredient used in Brazil. Temaki also often contains a large amount of cream cheese and is extremely popular in restaurants.[65] Multiple-filling rolls inspired by futomaki are a more popular type of sushi within the United States and come in variations that take their names from their places of origin. Other rolls may include a variety of ingredients, including chopped scallops, spicy tuna, beef or chicken teriyaki roll, okra, and assorted vegetables such as cucumber and avocado, and the tempura roll, where shrimp tempura is inside the roll or the entire roll is battered and fried tempura-style. In the Southern United States, many sushi restaurants prepare rolls using crawfish. Sometimes, rolls are made with brown rice or black rice, known as forbidden rice, which appear in Japanese cuisine as well. Per Food and Drug Administration regulations, raw fish served in the United States must be frozen before serving to kill parasites.[66] Since rolls are often made to order, it is not unusual for the customer to specify the exact ingredients desired (e.g., salmon roll, cucumber roll, avocado roll, tuna roll, shrimp or tuna tempura roll, etc.). Though the menu names of dishes often vary by restaurant, some examples include the following: Many of the styles seen in the United States are also seen in Canada and their own. Doshi (a portmanteau of donut and sushi) is a donut-shaped rice ball on a deep-fried crab or imitation crab cake topped with sushi ingredients.[85] Maki poutine is similar to makizushi in style except it is topped with cheese curds and gravy and contains duck confit, more cheese curds, and sweet potato tempura.[86] Sushi cake is made of crab meat, avocado, shiitake mushroom, salmon, spicy tuna, and tobiko and served on sushi rice, then torched with spicy mayonnaise, barbecue sauce, and balsamic reduction, and dotted with caper and garlic chips.[87] Sushi pizza is deep-fried rice or crab/imitation crab cake topped with mayonnaise and various sushi ingredients.[88] Sinaloan sushi originated in Sinaloa, Mexico and has been available in the Western United States since 2013.[89] Gimbap, similar to makizushi, is an internationally popular convenience food of Korean origin.[90] It consists of gim (the Korean version of nori) rolled around rice seasoned with sesame oil, instead of vinegar, and a variety of ingredients such as vegetables, like danmuji, and meat, like bulgogi.[91] All sushi has a base of specially prepared rice, complemented with other ingredients. Traditional Japanese sushi consists of rice flavored with vinegar sauce and various raw or cooked ingredients.  Sushi-meshi (\u9ba8\u98ef) (also known as su-meshi (\u9162\u98ef), shari (\u820e\u5229), or gohan (\u3054\u98ef)) is a preparation of white, short-grained, Japanese rice mixed with a dressing consisting of rice vinegar, sugar, salt, and occasionally kombu and sake. It must be cooled to room temperature before being used for a sushi filling, or it will get too sticky while seasoned. Traditionally, it is mixed with a hangiri (a round, flat-bottom wooden tub or barrel) and a shamoji (a wooden paddle). Sushi rice is prepared with short-grain Japanese rice, which has a consistency that differs from long-grain strains such as those from India, Sri Lanka, Bangladesh, Thailand, and Vietnam. The essential quality is its stickiness or glutinousness, although the type of rice used for sushi differs from glutinous rice. Freshly harvested rice (shinmai) typically contains too much water and requires extra time to drain the rice cooker after washing. In some fusion cuisine restaurants, short-grain brown rice and wild rice are also used. There are regional variations in sushi rice, and individual chefs have their methods. Most of the variations are in the rice vinegar dressing: the Kant\u014d region (or East Japan) version of the dressing commonly uses more salt; in Kansai region (or West Japan), the dressing has more sugar. The dark green seaweed wrappers used in makimono are called nori (\u6d77\u82d4). Nori is a type of algae traditionally cultivated in the harbors of Japan. Originally, algae was scraped from dock pilings, rolled out into thin, edible sheets, and dried in the sun, similar to making rice paper.[92] Today, the commercial product is farmed, processed, toasted, packaged, and sold in sheets. The size of a nori sheet influences the size of makimono. A full-size sheet produces futomaki, and a half produces hosomaki and temaki. To produce gunkan and some other makimono, an appropriately-sized piece of nori is cut from a whole sheet. Nori by itself is an edible snack and is available with salt or flavored with teriyaki sauce. The flavored variety, however, tends to be of lesser quality and is not suitable for sushi. When making fukusazushi, a paper-thin omelet may replace a sheet of nori as the wrapping. The omelet is traditionally made on a rectangular omelet pan, known as a makiyakinabe, and used to form the pouch for the rice and fillings.[93] The ingredients used inside sushi are called gu and are, typically, varieties of fish.[94] For culinary, sanitary, and aesthetic reasons, the minimum quality and freshness of fish to be eaten raw must be superior to that of fish that is to be cooked. Sushi chefs are trained to recognize important attributes, including smell, color, firmness, and freedom from parasites that may go undetected in a commercial inspection. Commonly used fish are tuna (maguro, shiro-maguro), Japanese amberjack, yellowtail (hamachi), snapper (kurodai), mackerel (saba), and salmon (sake). The most valued sushi ingredient is toro, the fatty cut of the fish.[95] This comes in a variety of \u014dtoro (often from the bluefin species of tuna) and ch\u016btoro, meaning \"middle toro\", implying that it is halfway into the fattiness between toro and the regular cut. Aburi style refers to nigiri sushi, where the fish is partially grilled (topside) and partially raw. Most nigiri sushi will have completely raw toppings, called neta.[94] Other seafoods such as squid (ika), eel (anago and unagi), pike conger (hamo), octopus (tako), shrimp (ebi and amaebi), clam (mirugai, aoyagi and akagai), fish roe (ikura, masago, kazunoko and tobiko), sea urchin (uni), crab (kani), and various kinds of shellfish (abalone, prawn, scallop) are the most popular seafoods in sushi. Oysters are less common, as the taste is thought to not go well with the rice. Kani kama, or imitation crab stick, is commonly substituted for real crab, most notably in California rolls.[96] Pickled daikon radish (takuan) in shinko maki, pickled vegetables (tsukemono), fermented soybeans (natt\u014d) in natt\u014d maki, avocado, cucumber in kappa maki, asparagus,[97] yam, pickled ume (umeboshi), gourd (kanpy\u014d), burdock (gobo), and sweet corn (sometimes mixed with mayonnaise) are plant products used in sushi. Tofu, eggs (in the form of slightly sweet, layered omelette called tamagoyaki), and raw quail eggs (as a gunkan-maki topping) are also common. Sushi is commonly eaten with condiments. Sushi may be dipped in sh\u014dyu (soy sauce), and is usually flavored with wasabi, a piquant paste made from the grated stem of the Wasabia japonica plant. Japanese-style mayonnaise is a common condiment in Japan on salmon, pork, and other sushi cuts. The traditional grating tool for wasabi is a sharkskin grater or samegawa oroshi. An imitation wasabi (seiyo-wasabi), made from horseradish, mustard powder, and green dye, is common. It is found at lower-end kaiten-zushi restaurants, in bento box sushi, and at most restaurants outside Japan. If manufactured in Japan, it may be labelled \"Japanese Horseradish\".[98] The spicy compound in both true and imitation wasabi is allyl isothiocyanate, which has well-known anti-microbial properties. However, true wasabi may contain some other antimicrobials as well.[99] Gari (sweet, pickled ginger) is eaten in between sushi courses to both cleanse the palate and aid in digestion. In Japan, green tea (ocha) is invariably served together with sushi. Better sushi restaurants often use a distinctive premium tea known as mecha. In sushi vocabulary, green tea is known as agari. Sushi may be garnished with gobo, grated daikon, thinly-sliced vegetables, carrots, radishes, and cucumbers that have been shaped to look like flowers, real flowers, or seaweed salad. When closely arranged on a tray, different pieces are often separated by green strips called baran or kiri-zasa (\u5207\u308a\u7b39). These dividers prevent the flavors of neighboring pieces of sushi from mixing and help to achieve an attractive presentation. Originally, these were cut leaves from the Aspidistra elatior (\u8449\u862d, haran) and Sasa veitchii (\u718a\u7b39, kuma-zasa) plants, respectively. Using actual leaves had the added benefit of releasing antimicrobial phytoncides when cut, thereby extending the limited shelf life of the sushi.[100] Sushi bento boxes are a staple of Japanese supermarkets and convenience stores. As these stores began rising in prominence in the 1960s, the labor-intensive cut leaves were increasingly replaced with green plastic to lower costs. This coincided with the increased prevalence of refrigeration, which extended sushi's shelf life without the need for cut leaves. Today plastic strips are commonly used in sushi bento boxes and, to a lesser degree, in sushi presentations found in sushi bars and restaurants. In store-sold or to-go packages of sushi, the plastic leaf strips are often used to prevent the rolls from coming into early or unwanted contact with the ginger and wasabi included with the dish.[101] The main ingredients of traditional Japanese sushi, raw fish and rice, are naturally low in fat and high in protein, carbohydrates (the rice only), vitamins, and minerals, as are gari and nori. Other vegetables wrapped in sushi[102] may also offer nutrients.[medical citation needed] Potential chemical and biological hazards in sushi include environmental contaminants, pathogens, and toxins. Large marine apex predators such as tuna (especially bluefin) can harbor high levels of methylmercury, one of many toxins of marine pollution. Frequent or significantly large consumption of methylmercury can lead to developmental defects when consumed by certain higher-risk groups, including women who are pregnant or may become pregnant, nursing mothers, and young children.[103] A 2021 study in Catalonia, Spain reported that the estimated exposure to methylmercury in sushi consumption by adolescents exceeded the tolerable daily intake.[104] A 2011 article reported approximately 18 million people infected with fish-borne flukes worldwide.[105] Such an infection can be dangerous for expecting mothers due to the health risks that medical interventions or treatment measures may pose on the developing fetus.[105] Parasitic infections can have a wide range of health impacts, including bowel obstruction, anemia, liver disease, and more.[105] These illnesses' impact can pose health concerns for the expecting mother and baby.[105] Sashimi or other types of sushi containing raw fish present a risk of infection by three main types of parasites: For these reasons, EU regulations forbid using raw fish that had not previously been frozen. It must be frozen at temperatures below \u221220\u00a0\u00b0C (\u22124\u00a0\u00b0F) in all product parts for no less than 24 hours.[109] Fish for sushi may be flash frozen on fishing boats and by suppliers to temperatures as low as \u221260\u00a0\u00b0C (\u221276\u00a0\u00b0F).[110] Super-freezing destroys parasites, and also prevents oxidation of the blood in tuna flesh that causes discoloration at temperatures above \u221220\u00a0\u00b0C (\u22124\u00a0\u00b0F).[111] Calls for stricter analysis and regulation of seafood include improved product description. A 2021 DNA study in Italy found 30%\u201340% of fish species in sushi incorrectly described.[112] Some forms of sushi, notably those containing the fugu pufferfish and some kinds of shellfish, can cause severe poisoning if not prepared properly. Fugu consumption, in particular, can be fatal. Fugu fish has a lethal dose of tetrodotoxin in its internal organs and, by law in many countries, must be prepared by a licensed fugu chef who has passed the prefectural examination in Japan.[113] Licensing involves a written test, a fish-identification test, and a practical test that involves preparing the fugu and separating out the poisonous organs; only about 35 percent of applicants pass.[114] Sustainable sushi is made from fished or farmed sources that can be maintained or whose future production does not significantly jeopardize the ecosystems from which it is acquired. Traditionally, sushi is served on minimalist Japanese-style, geometric, mono- or duo-tone wood or lacquer plates, keeping with this cuisine's aesthetic qualities.[citation needed] Many sushi restaurants offer fixed-price sets selected by the chef from the catch of the day. These are often graded as \u677e\u7af9\u6885 (sh\u014d-chiku-bai), sh\u014d/matsu (\u677e, pine), chiku/take (\u7af9, bamboo), and bai/ume (\u6885, plum), with matsu the most expensive and ume the cheapest.[citation needed] Sushi restaurants will often have private booth dining, where guests are asked to remove their shoes, leaving them outside the room; However, most sushi bars offer diners a casual experience with an open dining room concept. Sushi may be served kaiten zushi (sushi train) style: color-coded plates of sushi are placed on a conveyor belt from which diners pick as they please. After finishing, the bill is tallied by counting how many plates of each color have been taken. Newer kaiten zushi restaurants use barcodes or RFID tags embedded in the dishes to manage elapsed time after the item was prepared.[115] There is a practice called nyotaimori which entails serving sushi on the naked body of a woman.[116][117][118] Some specialized or slang terms are used in the sushi culture. Most of these terms are used only in sushi bars. Unlike sashimi, which is almost always eaten with chopsticks, nigirizushi is traditionally eaten with the fingers, even in formal settings.[122] Although it is commonly served on a small platter with a side dish for dipping, sushi can also be served in a bento, a box with small compartments that hold the various dishes of the meal. Soy sauce is the usual condiment, and sushi is normally served with a small sauce dish or a compartment in the bento. Traditional etiquette suggests that the sushi is turned over so that only the topping is dipped to flavor it; the rice\u2014which has already been seasoned with rice wine vinegar, sugar, salt, mirin, and kombu\u2014would otherwise absorb too much soy sauce and would fall apart.[123] Traditionally, the sushi chef will add an appropriate amount of wasabi to the sushi while preparing it, and the diner should not add more.[123] However, today, wasabi is more a matter of personal taste, and even restaurants in Japan may serve wasabi on the side for customers to use at their discretion, even when there is wasabi already in the dish.[124]", "Pad Thai": "Pad Thai, phat Thai, or phad Thai (/\u02ccp\u0251\u02d0d \u02c8ta\u026a/ or /\u02ccp\u00e6d \u02c8ta\u026a/; Thai: \u0e1c\u0e31\u0e14\u0e44\u0e17\u0e22, RTGS:\u00a0phat thai, ISO: p\u0304h\u1ea1d th\u1ecby, pronounced [p\u02b0\u00e0t\u031a t\u02b0\u0101j] \u24d8, 'Thai stir fry'), is a stir-fried rice noodle dish commonly served as a street food in Thailand as part of the country's cuisine.[1][2] As Thailand's national dish, it is typically made with rice noodles, shrimp, peanuts, scrambled egg and bean sprouts. The ingredients are fried in a wok.[3] Pad Thai was originally called \"Kuai Tiao Pad Thai\" but this was later shortened to simply Pad Thai.[4][5] Kuai tiao (\u0e01\u0e4b\u0e27\u0e22\u0e40\u0e15\u0e35\u0e4b\u0e22\u0e27) is a Thai borrowing of the Teochew word gu\u00ea2 diao5 (\u7cbf\u689d), a type of thick Chinese rice noodle also known as shahe fen. The word kuai tiao has cognates in several other Southeast Asian countries where Chinese immigrants settled; with kuyteav in Cambodia, h\u1ee7 ti\u1ebfu in Vietnam, and kway teow in Malaysia and Singapore being analogues.[6] Although stir-fried rice noodles were introduced to Thailand from China centuries ago, the dish pad Thai was invented in the mid-20th century.[7] Author Mark Padoongpatt[8] maintains that pad Thai is \"...not this traditional, authentic, going back hundreds of years dish. It was actually created in the 1930s in Thailand. The dish was created because Thailand was focused on nation-building.[2] So this dish was created using rice noodles and it was called Pad Thai as a way to galvanize nationalism.\"[9] Another explanation of pad Thai's provenance holds that, during World War II, Thailand suffered a rice shortage due to the war and floods. To reduce domestic rice consumption, the Thai government under Prime Minister Plaek Phibunsongkhram promoted consumption of noodles instead.[10] His government promoted rice noodles and helped to establish the identity of Thailand.[2] As a result, a new noodle called sen chan pad Thai (named after Chanthaburi Province) was created. Pad Thai has since become one of Thailand's national dishes.[11][12] Today, some food vendors add pork or chicken (although the original recipe did not contain meat because of the government's perception that pork was a Chinese meat).[13] Some food vendors still use the original recipe. Thai-American food writer Kasma Loha-unchit disputes the claim of a native Thai origin and suggests that pad Thai was actually invented by the Chinese immigrants themselves, because \"for a dish to be so named in its own country clearly suggests an origin that isn't Thai\".[14] Noodle cookery in most Southeast Asian countries was introduced by the wave of immigrants from southern China settling in the region the past century. Loha-unchit states that the ethnic Chinese of Thailand were aware that \"Central Thai people were very fond of the combination of hot, sour, sweet and salty flavors, they added these to their stir-fried noodle dishes and gave it a fusion name, much like Western chefs today are naming their dishes Thai this or Thai that on their East-West menus.\"[15] At least as early as 2001, the Thai government used pad Thai as a form of \"soft power,\"[16] creating \"the Global Thai Restaurant Company, Ltd., in an effort to establish at least 3,000 Thai restaurants worldwide.\"[17] The plan included numerous government agencies and resulted in nearly tripling the number of Thai restaurants globally in seventeen years.[17] Pad Thai is listed at number five on a list of \"World's 50 most delicious foods\" readers' poll compiled by CNN Go in 2011.[18] Pad Thai is made with rice noodles, which are stir fried with eggs and chopped firm tofu, flavored with tamarind juice, fish sauce, dried shrimp, garlic, shallots, and sometimes red chili pepper and palm sugar, and served with lime wedges and often crushed roasted peanuts.[19][20] It may contain other vegetables like bean sprouts, garlic chives, preserved radish, and raw banana flowers. It may also contain fresh shrimp, crab, squid, chicken, or other fish or meat.[19][20] Many of the ingredients are provided on the side as condiments, such as red chili pepper, lime wedges, roasted peanuts, bean sprouts, garlic chives, and other miscellaneous fresh vegetables.[21] Vegetarian versions may substitute soy sauce for the fish sauce and omit the shrimp entirely. Hot", "Beef Stroganoff": "Beef Stroganoff or beef Stroganov[a] is a Russian dish of saut\u00e9ed pieces of beef in a sauce of mustard and smetana (sour cream). From its origins in mid-19th-century Tsarist Russia, it has become popular around the world, with considerable variation from the original recipe. Mushrooms are common in many variants. The dish is named after one of the members of the Stroganov family.[2][3][4][5] A legend attributes its invention to French chefs working for the family,[6] but several researchers point out that the recipe is a refined version of older Russian dishes.[3][4] In Russian the dish is called \u0411\u0435\u0444\u0441\u0442\u0440\u043e\u0301\u0433\u0430\u043d\u043e\u0432 from the French B\u0153uf Stroganoff.[7] Elena Molokhovets\u00a0[ru]'s classic Russian cookbook A Gift to Young Housewives gives the first known recipe for Govjadina po-strogonovski, s gorchitseju, \"Beef \u00e0 la Stroganov, with mustard\", in its 1871 edition.[8][3][4] The recipe involves beef cubes (not strips) prepared in a dry marinade of salt and allspice, and then saut\u00e9ed in butter. The sauce is a simple roux mixed with prepared mustard and broth, and finished with a small amount of sour cream: no onions, no mushrooms and no alcohol. In 1891, the French chef Charles Bri\u00e8re, who was working in Saint Petersburg, submitted a recipe for beef Stroganoff to a competition sponsored by the French magazine L'Art culinaire.[4] This led Larousse Gastronomique to assume that he was the inventor of this dish, but both the recipe and the name existed before then. Another recipe, this one from 1909, adds onions and tomato sauce, and serves it with crisp potato straws, which are considered the traditional side dish for beef Stroganoff in Russia.[8][9]  The version given in the 1938 Larousse Gastronomique includes beef strips, and onions, with either mustard or tomato paste optional. After the fall of Tsarist Russia, the recipe was popularly served in the hotels and restaurants of China before the start of World War II.[10] Russian and Chinese immigrants, as well as US servicemen stationed in pre-Communist China, brought several variants of the dish to the United States, which may account for its popularity during the 1950s.[citation needed] It came to Hong Kong in the late fifties,[11] with Russian restaurants and hotels serving the dish with rice but not sour cream.[citation needed] In 1960s United States, several manufacturers introduced dehydrated beef stroganoff mixes, which were mixed with cooked beef and sour cream.[12][13] It was also available freeze-dried for campers.[14] Beef Stroganoff preparation varies significantly not only based on geography, but based on other factors as well, such as the cut of meat and seasonings selected. Meat for the dish can be cut in different ways and is sometimes diced, cubed, or cut into strips. Some variations include mushrooms and onions or other vegetables and varied seasonings such as sugar, salt, black pepper, and bottled marinades (especially Worcestershire sauce) and rubs.[15] In the version often prepared in the United States today in restaurants and hotels, it consists of strips of beef filet with a mushroom, onion, and sour cream sauce, and is served over rice or noodles.[16] Today, the dish is generally served over wide or twisted egg noodles in the United States. British pubs usually serve a version of the dish with a creamy white wine sauce, whereas more \"authentic\" versions are often red stews with a scoop of sour cream separately served on top.[citation needed] Larousse Gastronomique lists Stroganoff as a cream, paprika, veal stock and white wine recipe.\nThe Brazilian variant includes diced beef or strips of beef with tomato sauce, onions, mushrooms and heavy cream. Brazilians also prepare Stroganoff with chicken or even shrimp instead of beef. It is commonly served with a side of shoe-string potatoes and white rice. In Portuguese it is called Strogonoff or Estrogonofe. Stroganoff is also popular in Nordic countries. In Sweden, a common variant is korv Stroganoff\u00a0[sv] (lit.\u2009'sausage Stroganoff'), which uses the local falukorv sausage as a substitute for the beef.  In Finland, the dish is called makkara-stroganoff, makkara meaning any kind of sausage. Beef Stroganoff is, however, also a common dish. Diced brined pickles are also a normal ingredient in Finnish Stroganoff. Stroganoff's popularity extends to Japan, where it is most commonly served with white rice, or white rice seasoned with parsley and butter.  Its popularity increased dramatically with the introduction of \"instant sauce cubes\" from S&B Foods.  These are cubes with dried seasoning and thickening agents that can be added to water, onion, beef, and mushrooms to make a Stroganoff-style sauce.  Additionally, Japanese home recipes for Stroganoff frequently call for ingredients that are outside of Russian tradition, such as small amounts of soy sauce.[citation needed] Hot", "Tacos": " A taco (US: /\u02c8t\u0251\u02d0ko\u028a/, UK: /\u02c8t\u00e6ko\u028a/, Spanish:\u00a0[\u02c8tako]) is a traditional Mexican dish consisting of a small hand-sized corn- or wheat-based tortilla topped with a filling. The tortilla is then folded around the filling and eaten by hand. A taco can be made with a variety of fillings, including beef, pork, chicken, seafood, beans, vegetables, and cheese, and garnished with various condiments, such as salsa, guacamole, or sour cream, and vegetables, such as lettuce, onion, tomatoes, and chiles.[1] Tacos are a common form of antojitos, or Mexican street food, which have spread around the world.[2] Tacos can be contrasted with similar foods such as burritos, which are often much larger and rolled rather than folded; taquitos, which are rolled and fried; or chalupas/tostadas, in which the tortilla is fried before filling. The origins of the taco are not precisely known, and etymologies for the culinary usage of the word are generally theoretical.[3][4] Taco in the sense of a typical Mexican dish comprising a maize tortilla folded around food is just one of the meanings connoted by the word, according to the Real Academia Espa\u00f1ola, publisher of Diccionario de la Lengua Espa\u00f1ola.[5] This meaning of the Spanish word \"taco\" is a Mexican innovation,[4] but the word \"taco\" is used in other contexts to mean \"wedge; wad, plug; billiard cue; blowpipe; ramrod; short, stocky person; [or] short, thick piece of wood.\"[5] The etymological origin of this sense of the word is Germanic and has cognates in other European languages, including the French word tache and the English word \"tack\".[6] In Spain, the word \"taco\" can also be used in the context of tacos de jam\u00f3n\u00a0[es]:  these are diced pieces of ham, or sometimes bits and shavings of ham leftover after a larger piece is sliced.[7] They can be served on their own as tapas or street food, or can be added to other dishes such as salmorejo, omelettes, stews, empanadas, or mel\u00f3n con jam\u00f3n\u00a0[es].[8][9][10] According to one etymological theory, the culinary origin of the term \"taco\" in Mexico can be traced to its employment, among Mexican silver miners, as a term signifying \"plug.\" The miners used explosive charges in plug form, consisting of a paper wrapper and gunpowder filling.[3] Indigenous origins are also proposed. One possibility is that the word derives from the Nahuatl word tlahco, meaning \"half\" or \"in the middle\",[11] in the sense that food would be placed in the middle of a tortilla.[12] Furthermore, dishes analogous to the taco were known to have existed in Pre-Columbian society\u2014for example, the Nahuatl word tlaxcalli (a type of corn tortilla).[11] There is significant debate about the origins of the taco in Mexico, with some arguing that the taco predates the arrival of the Spanish in Mexico, since there is anthropological evidence that the indigenous people living in the lake region of the Valley of Mexico traditionally ate tacos filled with small fish.[13] Writing at the time of the Spanish conquistadors, Bernal D\u00edaz del Castillo documented the first taco feast enjoyed by Europeans, a meal which Hern\u00e1n Cort\u00e9s arranged for his captains in Coyoac\u00e1n.[14][15] Others argue that the advent of the taco is much more recent, with one of the more popular theories being that the taco was invented by silver miners in the 18th century,[16] One of the oldest mentions of the term taco comes from an 1836 cookbook \u2014Nuevo y sencillo arte de cocina, reposteria y refrescos\u2014 by Antonia Carrillo; in a recipe for a rolled pork loin (lomo de cerdo enrollado), she instructs the readers to roll the loin like they would a \u201ctaco de tortilla\u201d or tortilla taco.[17] Another mention of the word taco comes from the novel \u2014El hombre de la situaci\u00f3n (1861)\u2014 by Mexican writer Manuel Payno:[18] \u201cThey surrounded the father's bed, and he, putting a pillow on his legs, which served as a table, began to give the example, and a pleasant gathering was formed, which was completed by the mother, who always entered last, waving with one hand (from right to left) a large cup of white atole, while with the other, she carried right to her mouth, a tortilla taco filled with a spread of red chile. These instances predate the theory that the first mention of the word \"taco\" in Mexico was in the 1891 novel Los bandidos de R\u00edo Fr\u00edo by Manuel Payno.[19] The term taco was regional, specifically from Mexico City and surrounding areas, and that other regional names existed. In Guanajuato, Guerrero, Michoac\u00e1n, and San Luis Potos\u00ed, the term used was burrito, while in Yucat\u00e1n and Quintana Roo the term used was codzito (co\u00e7ito).[20][21][22] Due to the cultural influence of Mexico City, the term taco became the default, and terms like burrito and codzito, either became forgotten or evolved to mean something different in modern times.[citation needed] In 2024, El Califa de Le\u00f3n in Mexico City became the first taco stand to win a Michelin star.[23] As an accompaniment to tacos, many taco stands will serve whole or sliced red radishes, lime slices, salt, pickled or grilled chilis (hot peppers), and occasionally cucumber slices, or grilled cambray onions. The hard-shell or crispy taco is a tradition that developed in the United States. The most common type of taco in the US is the hard-shell, U-shaped version, first described in a cookbook in 1949.[36] This type of taco is typically served as a crisp-fried corn tortilla filled with seasoned ground beef, cheese, lettuce, and sometimes tomato, onion, salsa, sour cream, and avocado or guacamole.[37] Such tacos are sold by restaurants and by fast food chains, while kits are readily available in most supermarkets. Hard shell tacos are sometimes known as tacos dorados (\"golden tacos\") in Spanish,[38] a name that they share with taquitos. Various sources credit different individuals with the invention of the hard-shell taco, but some form of the dish likely predates all of them.[38] Beginning from the early part of the twentieth century, various types of tacos became popular in the country, especially in Texas and California but also elsewhere.[39] By the late 1930s, companies like Ashley Mexican Food and Absolute Mexican Foods were selling appliances and ingredients for cooking hard shell tacos, and the first patents for hard-shell taco cooking appliances were filed in the 1940s.[38] In the mid-1950s, Glen Bell opened Taco Tia, and began selling a simplified version of the tacos being sold by Mexican restaurants in San Bernardino, particularly the tacos dorados being sold at the Mitla Cafe, owned by Lucia and Salvador Rodriguez across the street from another of Bell's restaurants.[38] Over the next few years, Bell owned and operated a number of restaurants in southern California including four called El Taco.[40] The tacos sold at Bell's restaurants were many Anglo Americans' first introduction to Mexican food.[38] Bell sold the El Tacos to his partner and built the first Taco Bell in Downey in 1962. Kermit Becky, a former Los Angeles police officer, bought the first Taco Bell franchise from Glen Bell in 1964,[40] and located it in Torrance. The company grew rapidly, and by 1967, the 100th restaurant opened at 400 South Brookhurst in Anaheim. In 1968, its first franchise location east of the Mississippi River opened in Springfield, Ohio.[41] Traditionally, soft-shelled tacos referred to corn tortillas that were cooked to a softer state than a hard taco \u2013 usually by grilling or steaming. More recently, the term has come to include flour-tortilla-based tacos mostly from large manufacturers and restaurant chains. In this context, soft tacos are tacos made with wheat flour tortillas and filled with the same ingredients as a hard taco.[42] The breakfast taco, found in Tex-Mex cuisine, is a soft corn or flour tortilla filled with meat, eggs, or cheese, which can also contain other ingredients.[43] Some have claimed that Austin, Texas, is the home of the breakfast taco.[44] However, food writer and OC Weekly editor Gustavo Arellano responded that such a statement reflects a common trend of \"whitewashed\" foodways reporting, noting that predominantly Hispanic San Antonio, Texas, \"never had to brag about its breakfast taco love\u2014folks there just call it 'breakfast'\".[45] Indian tacos, or Navajo tacos, are made using frybread instead of tortillas. They are commonly eaten at pow-wows, festivals, and other gatherings by and for indigenous people in the United States and Canada.[46][47] This kind of taco is not known to have been present before the arrival of Europeans in what is now the Southwestern United States. Navajo tradition indicates that frybread came into use in the 1860s when the government forced the tribe to relocate from their homeland in Arizona in a journey known as the Long Walk of the Navajo. It was made from ingredients given to them by the government to supplement their diet since the region could not support growing the agricultural commodities that had been previously used.[48] Since at least 1978, a variation called the \"puffy taco\" has been popular. Henry's Puffy Tacos, opened by Henry Lopez in San Antonio, Texas, claims to have invented the variation, in which uncooked corn tortillas (flattened balls of masa dough[49]) are quickly fried in hot oil until they expand and become \"puffy\".[50][51] Fillings are similar to hard-shell versions. Restaurants offering this style of taco have since appeared in other Texas cities, as well as in California, where Henry's brother, Arturo Lopez, opened Arturo's Puffy Taco in Whittier, not long after Henry's opened.[52][53] Henry's continues to thrive, managed by the family's second generation.[50] Kits are available at grocery and convenience stores and usually consist of taco shells (corn tortillas already fried in a U-shape), seasoning mix and taco sauce. Commercial vendors for the home market also market soft taco kits with tortillas instead of taco shells.[54][55] The tacodilla contains melted cheese in between the two folded tortillas, thus resembling a quesadilla.[56]          ", "Ramen": " Ramen (/\u02c8r\u0251\u02d0m\u0259n/) (\u62c9\u9eba, \u30e9\u30fc\u30e1\u30f3 or \u3089\u30fc\u3081\u3093, r\u0101men, [\u027ea\ua71c\u02d0me\u0274] \u24d8) is a Japanese noodle dish. It consists of Chinese-style wheat noodles (\u4e2d\u83ef\u9eba, ch\u016bkamen) served in a broth; common flavors are soy sauce and miso, with typical toppings including sliced pork (ch\u0101sh\u016b), nori (dried seaweed), menma (bamboo shoots), and scallions. Ramen has its roots in Chinese noodle dishes and is a part of Japanese Chinese cuisine.[1] Nearly every region in Japan has its own variation of ramen, such as the tonkotsu (pork bone broth) ramen of Kyushu and the miso ramen of Hokkaido. The origins of ramen can be traced back to Yokohama Chinatown in the early 20th century. The word \"ramen\" is a Japanese borrowing of the Chinese word lamian (\u62c9\u9eb5), meaning \"pulled noodles\", but is not derived from the northern Chinese dish of lamian. Instead, the dish evolved from southern Chinese noodle dishes from regions such as Guangzhou, reflecting the demographics of Chinese settlers in Yokohama. Ramen gained popularity in Japan, especially during food shortages following World War II. In 1958, instant noodles were invented by Momofuku Ando, further popularizing the dish. Today, ramen is a cultural icon in Japan, with many regional varieties and a wide range of toppings. Examples include Sapporo's rich miso ramen, Hakodate's salt-flavored ramen, Kitakata's thick, flat noodles in pork-and-niboshi broth, Tokyo-style ramen with soy-flavored chicken broth, Yokohama's Iekei Ramen with soy flavored pork broth, Wakayama's soy sauce and pork bone broth, and Hakata's milky tonkotsu (pork bone) broth. Ramen is offered in various establishments and locations, with the best quality usually found in specialist ramen shops called ramenya (\u30e9\u30fc\u30e1\u30f3\u5c4b). Ramen's popularity has spread outside of Japan. In Korea, ramen is known as ramyeon (\ub77c\uba74). In China, ramen is called r\u00ecsh\u00ec l\u0101mi\u00e0n (\u65e5\u5f0f\u62c9\u9eb5 \"Japanese-style lamian\"). Ramen has also made its way into Western restaurant chains. Instant ramen was exported from Japan in 1971 and has since gained international recognition. The word ramen is a Japanese borrowing of the Mandarin Chinese l\u0101mi\u00e0n (\u62c9\u9eb5, 'pulled noodles').[2][3] The word ramen (\u62c9\u9eba) first appeared in Japan in Seiichi Yoshida's How to Prepare Delicious and Economical Chinese Dishes (1928).[4] In the book, Yoshida describes how to make ramen using flour and kansui, kneading it by hand, and stretching it with an illustration. He also states that ramen is better suited for soup or cold noodles than for baked noodles. In this case, however, ramen refers to Chinese noodles, not the dish. The first mention of ramen as a dish appears in Hatsuko Kuroda's Enjoyable Home Cooking (1947).[5] Early ramen or ramen-like dishes went by different names, such as Nankin soba (\u5357\u4eac\u305d\u3070, lit.\u2009'Nanjing noodles'), named after the city which was the then capital of China), Shina soba (\u652f\u90a3\u305d\u3070, lit.\u2009'Chinese noodles') or Ch\u016bka soba (\u4e2d\u83ef\u305d\u3070, lit.\u2009'Chinese noodles').[6][7][8] For example, in 1903, in Yokohama Chinatown (then known as Nanjing Town), there was a Nanjing noodle restaurant (\u5357\u4eac\u854e\u9ea6\u6240, Nankin soba dokoro).[9] Until the 1950s, ramen was most commonly called Shina soba, but today Ch\u016bka soba or just ramen (\u30e9\u30fc\u30e1\u30f3) are more common, as the word \u652f\u90a3 (Shina, meaning 'China') has acquired a pejorative connotation through its association with Japanese imperialism.[10] Ramen is a Japanese adaptation of Chinese wheat noodle soups.[11][12][13][14][15] It is first recorded to have appeared in Yokohama Chinatown in the early 20th century.[16][17] Although ramen takes its name from l\u0101mi\u00e0n, it did not originate from the hand-pulled lamian noodles of northern China, since the noodles used in ramen are cut, not pulled.[7] Rather, ramen is derived from southern Chinese noodle dishes such as char siu tangmian (roast pork noodle soup) from Guangdong, and rousi tangmian (sliced meat noodle soup) from Jiangnan.[18][8][6][19] This is reflective of Yokohama Chinatown's demographics, as most Chinese settlers in the district came from the cities of Guangzhou and Shanghai.[20][21] S\u014dmen is another type of noodle of Chinese origin made from wheat flour, but in Japan it is distinguished from the noodles used in ramen. The noodles used for ramen today are called ch\u016bkamen (\u4e2d\u83ef\u9eba, lit.\u2009'Chinese noodles') and are made with kansui (\u9e79\u6c34, alkaline salt water), but since there is no natural kansui in Japan, it was difficult to make ch\u016bkamen before the Meiji Restoration (1868). The official diary of Sh\u014dkoku-ji Temple in Kyoto, Inry\u014dken Nichiroku (\u852d\u6dbc\u8ed2\u65e5\u9332), mentions eating j\u012bngd\u00e0imi\u00e0n (\u7d4c\u5e2f\u9eaa), noodles with kansui, in 1488.[22][23] J\u012bngd\u00e0imi\u00e0n is the noodle of the Yuan dynasty. This is the earliest record of kansui noodles being eaten in Japan. One theory says that ramen was introduced to Japan during the 1660s by the neo-Confucian scholar Zhu Shunsui, who served as an advisor to Tokugawa Mitsukuni after he became a refugee in Japan to escape Manchu rule. Mitsukuni became the first Japanese person to eat ramen. However, the noodles Mitsukuni ate were a mixture of starch made from lotus root and wheat flour, which is different from ch\u016bkamen with kansui.[23] According to historians, the more plausible theory is that ramen was introduced to Japan in the late 19th[11][24] or early 20th centuries by Chinese immigrants living in Yokohama Chinatown.[16][17] By 1900, restaurants serving Chinese cuisine from Guangzhou and Shanghai offered a simple dish of noodles, a few toppings, and a broth flavored with salt and pork bones. Many Chinese living in Japan also pulled portable food stalls, selling ramen and gy\u014dza dumplings to workers. By the mid-1900s, these stalls used a type of a musical horn called a charumera (\u30c1\u30e3\u30eb\u30e1\u30e9, from the Portuguese charamela) to advertise their presence, a practice some vendors still retain via a loudspeaker and a looped recording. By the early Sh\u014dwa period, ramen had become a popular dish when eating out.[citation needed] According to ramen expert Hiroshi Osaki, the first specialized ramen shop was Rairaiken\u00a0[ja] (\u6765\u3005\u8ed2), which opened in 1910 in Asakusa, Tokyo. The Japanese founder, Kan'ichi Ozaki (\u5c3e\u5d0e\u8cab\u4e00), employed twelve Cantonese cooks from Yokohama's Chinatown and served the ramen arranged for Japanese customers.[25][26] Early versions were wheat noodles in broth topped with char siu.[11] The store also served standard Chinese fare like wontons and shumai, and is sometimes regarded as the origin of Japanese-Chinese fusion dishes like ch\u016bkadon and tenshindon.[27][28] Rairaiken's original store closed in 1976, but related stores with the same name currently exist in other places, and have connections to the first store. In 1933, Fu Xinglei (\u5085\u8208\u96f7), one of the twelve original chefs, opened a second Rairaiken in Y\u016btenji, Meguro Ward, Tokyo.[29] In 1968, one of Kan'ichi Ozaki's apprentices opened a store named Shinraiken (\"New Raiken\") in Chiba Prefecture.[29] In 2020, Ozaki's grandson and great-great-grandson re-opened the original Rairaiken as a store inside Shin-Yokohama R\u0101men Museum.[30] After Japan's defeat in World War II, the American military occupied the country from 1945 to 1952.[11] In December 1945, Japan recorded its worst rice harvest in 42 years,[11][31] which caused food shortages as Japan had drastically reduced rice production during the war as production shifted to colonies in China and Formosa island.[11] The US flooded the market with cheap wheat flour to deal with food shortages.[11] From 1948 to 1951, bread consumption in Japan increased from 262,121 tons to 611,784 tons,[11] but wheat also found its way into ramen, which most Japanese ate at black market food vendors to survive as the government food distribution system ran about 20 days behind schedule.[11] Although the Americans maintained Japan's wartime ban on outdoor food vending,[11] flour was secretly diverted from commercial mills into the black markets,[11] where nearly 90 percent of stalls were under the control of gangsters related to the yakuza who extorted vendors for protection money.[11] Thousands of ramen vendors were arrested during the occupation.[11] In the same period, millions of Japanese troops returned from China and continental East Asia from their posts in the Second Sino-Japanese War. Some of them would have been familiar with wheat noodles.[11] By 1950 wheat flour exchange controls were removed and restrictions on food vending loosened, which further boosted the number of ramen vendors: private companies even rented out yatai starter kits consisting of noodles, toppings, bowls, and chopsticks.[11] Ramen yatai provided a rare opportunity for small-scale postwar entrepreneurship.[11] The Americans also aggressively advertised the nutritional benefits of wheat and animal protein.[11] The combination of these factors caused wheat noodles to gain prominence in Japan's rice-based culture.[11] Gradually, ramen became associated with urban life.[11] In 1958, instant noodles were invented by Momofuku Ando, the Taiwanese-Japanese founder and chairman of Nissin Foods. Named the greatest Japanese invention of 20th century in a Japanese poll,[32] instant ramen allowed anyone to make an approximation of this dish simply by adding boiling water. Beginning in the 1980s, ramen became a Japanese cultural icon and was studied around the world. At the same time, local varieties of ramen were hitting the national market and could even be ordered by their regional names. A ramen museum opened in Yokohama in 1994.[33] Today ramen is one of Japan's most popular foods, with Tokyo alone containing around 5,000 ramen shops,[11] and more than 24,000 ramen shops across Japan.[34] Tsuta, a ramen restaurant in Tokyo's Sugamo district, received a Michelin star in December 2015.[34] A wide variety of ramen exists in Japan, with geographical and vendor-specific differences even in varieties that share the same name. Usually varieties of ramen are differentiated by the type of broth and tare used. There are five components to a bowl of ramen: tare, aroma oil, broth, noodles and toppings.[35] Most noodles are made from four basic ingredients: wheat flour, salt, water, and kansui\u00a0[ja], derived from the Chinese ji\u01censhu\u01d0 (\u9e7c\u6c34), a type of alkaline mineral water containing sodium carbonate and usually potassium carbonate, as well as sometimes a small amount of phosphoric acid. Ramen is not to be confused with different kinds of noodle such as soba, udon, or somen. The kansui is the distinguishing ingredient in ramen noodles, and originated in Inner Mongolia, where some lakes contain large amounts of these minerals and whose water is said to be perfect for making these noodles. Making noodles with kansui lends them a yellowish hue as well as a firm texture.[citation needed] Eggs may also be substituted for kansui. Some noodles are made with neither eggs nor kansui and should only be used for yakisoba, as they have a weaker structure and are more prone to soaking up moisture and becoming extremely soft when served in soup.[citation needed] Ramen comes in various shapes and lengths. It may be thick, thin, or even ribbon-like, as well as straight or wrinkled. Traditionally, ramen noodles were made by hand, but with growing popularity, many ramen restaurants prefer to use noodle-making machines to meet the increased demand and improve quality. Automatic ramen-making machines imitating manual production methods have been available since the mid-20th century produced by such Japanese manufacturers as Yamato MFG. and others.[36] Similar to Chinese soup bases, ramen soup is generally made from chicken or pork, though vegetable and fish stock is also used. This base stock is often combined with dashi stock components such as katsuobushi (skipjack tuna flakes), niboshi (dried baby sardines),[37] shiitake, and kombu (kelp). Ramen stock is usually divided into two categories: chintan and paitan. Tare is a sauce that is used to flavor the broth. The main purpose of tare is to provide salt to the broth, but tare also usually adds other flavors, such as umami. There are three main kinds of tare.[35] After basic preparation, ramen can be adorned with any number of toppings, including but not limited to:[39] Seasonings commonly added to ramen are white pepper, black pepper, butter, chili pepper, sesame seeds, and crushed garlic.[40] Soup recipes and methods of preparation tend to be closely guarded secrets. Most tonkotsu ramen restaurants offer a system known as kae-dama (\u66ff\u3048\u7389), where customers who have finished their noodles can request a \"refill\" (for a few hundred yen more) to be put into their remaining soup.[41] While standard versions of ramen are available throughout Japan since the Taish\u014d period, the last few decades have shown a proliferation of regional variations, commonly referred to as gotouchi ramen (\u3054\u5f53\u5730\u30e9\u30fc\u30e1\u30f3 \"regional ramen\"). Some of these which have gone on to national prominence are: There are many related, Chinese-influenced noodle dishes in Japan. The following are often served alongside ramen in ramen establishments. They do not include noodle dishes considered traditionally Japanese, such as soba or udon, which are almost never served in the same establishments as ramen. Ramen is offered in various types of restaurants and locations including ramen shops, izakaya drinking establishments, lunch cafeterias, karaoke halls, and amusement parks. Many ramen restaurants only have a counter and a chef. In these shops, the meals are paid for in advance at a ticket machine to streamline the process.[48] However, the best quality ramen is usually only available in specialist ramen-ya restaurants. Some restaurants also provide Halal ramen (using chicken) in Osaka and Kyoto. As ramen-ya restaurants offer mainly ramen dishes, they tend to lack variety in the menu. Besides ramen, some of the dishes generally available in a ramen-ya restaurant include other dishes from Japanese Chinese cuisine such as fried rice (called chahan or yakimeshi), gyoza (Chinese dumplings), and beer. Ramen-ya interiors are often filled with Chinese-inspired decorations.[49] From January 2020 and September 2021 during the COVID-19 pandemic, many ramen restaurants were temporarily closed, with 34 chains filing for bankruptcy by September 2020. Ramen restaurants are typically narrow and seat customers closely, making social distancing difficult.[50] Ramen became popular in China where it is known as r\u00ecsh\u00ec l\u0101mi\u00e0n (\u65e5\u5f0f\u62c9\u9eb5, lit.\u2009'Japanese-style lamian'). Restaurant chains serve ramen alongside  Japanese dishes, such as tempura and yakitori. In Japan, these dishes are not traditionally served with ramen, but gyoza, kara-age and others from Japanese Chinese cuisine.[citation needed] In Korea, ramen is called ramyeon (\ub77c\uba74 / \u62c9\u9eb5). There are different varieties, such as kimchi-flavored ramyeon. While usually served with egg or vegetables such as carrots and scallions, some restaurants serve variations of ramyeon containing additional ingredients such as dumplings, tteok, or cheese as toppings.[51] Outside of Asia, particularly in areas with a large demand for Asian cuisine, there are restaurants specializing in Japanese-style foods such as ramen noodles. For example, Wagamama, a UK-based restaurant chain serving pan-Asian food, serves a ramen noodle soup and in the United States and Canada, Jinya Ramen Bar serves tonkotsu ramen. Instant ramen noodles were exported from Japan by Nissin Foods starting in 1971, bearing the name \"Oodles of Noodles\".[52] One year later, it was re-branded \"Nissin Cup Noodles\", packaged in a foam food container (It is referred to as Cup Ramen in Japan), and subsequently saw a growth in international sales. Over time, the term ramen became used in North America to refer to other instant noodles. While some research has claimed that consuming instant ramen two or more times a week increases the likelihood of developing heart disease and other conditions, including diabetes and stroke, especially in women, those claims have not been reproduced and no study has isolated instant ramen consumption as an aggravating factor.[53][54] However, instant ramen noodles, known to have a serving of 43 g, consist of very high sodium.[55] At least 1,760 mg of sodium are found in one packet alone. It consists of 385k calories, 55.7 g of carbohydrates, 14.5 g of total fat, 6.5 g of saturated fat, 7.9 g of protein, and 0.6 mg of thiamine.[56][better\u00a0source\u00a0needed] In Akihabara, Tokyo, vending machines distribute warm ramen in a steel can known as ramen kan (\u3089\u30fc\u3081\u3093\u7f36). It is produced by a popular local ramen restaurant in flavors such as tonkotsu and curry, and contains noodles, soup, menma, and pork. It is intended as a quick snack, and includes a small folded plastic fork.[57] In October 2010, an emoji was approved for Unicode 6.0 U+1F35C \ud83c\udf5c STEAMING BOWL for \"Steaming Bowl\", that depicts Japanese ramen noodles in a bowl of steaming broth with chopsticks.[58] In 2015, the icon was added to Emoji 1.0.[59] The Shin-Yokohama R\u0101men Museum is a unique museum about ramen, in the Shin-Yokohama district of K\u014dhoku-ku, Yokohama.[60]", "Falafel": "  Falafel (/f\u0259\u02c8l\u0251\u02d0f\u0259l/; Arabic: \u0641\u0644\u0627\u0641\u0644, [f\u00e6\u02c8l\u00e6\u02d0f\u026al] \u24d8) is a deep-fried ball or patty-shaped fritter of Egyptian origin, featuring in Middle Eastern cuisine, particularly Levantine cuisines, and is made from broad beans, ground chickpeas, or both. Falafel is often served in a pita, samoon, laffa, or wrapped in a flatbread known as taboon; \"falafel\" also frequently refers to a wrapped sandwich that is prepared in this way. The falafel balls may be topped with salads, pickled vegetables, and hot sauce, and drizzled with tahini-based sauces. Falafel balls may also be eaten alone as a snack or served as part of a meze tray (assortment of appetizers). Falafel is eaten throughout the Middle East and is a common street food. Falafel is usually made with fava beans in Egyptian cuisine, with chickpeas in Palestinian cuisine,[1] or either just chickpeas or a combination of both in Jordan, Lebanon and Syria.[1][2][3] It is popular with vegetarians worldwide.[4] The Palestinian chickpea version of the falafel has been adopted into Israeli cuisine, where it features prominently and has been called a national dish of Israel, which Palestinians and other Arabs have criticized and characterized as cultural appropriation.[1][5] The word fal\u0101fil (Arabic: \u0641\u0644\u0627\u0641\u0644) is Arabic and is the plural of filfil (\u0641\u0644\u0641\u0644) 'pepper',[6] borrowed from Persian felfel (\u0641\u0644\u0641\u0644),[7] cognate with the Sanskrit word pippal\u012b (\u092a\u093f\u092a\u094d\u092a\u0932\u0940) 'long pepper'; or an earlier *filfal, from Aramaic pilp\u0101l 'small round thing, peppercorn', derived from palp\u0113l 'to be round, roll'.[8] The name fal\u0101fil is used world-wide. In English (where it has been written falafel, felafel, filafel and filafil), it is first attested in 1936.[9] Falafel is known as ta\u02bfmiya (Egyptian Arabic: \u0637\u0639\u0645\u064a\u0629 \u1e6da\u02bfmiyya, IPA: [t\u02e4\u0251\u0295\u02c8mejj\u0251]) in Egypt and Sudan. The word is derived from a diminutive form of the Arabic word \u1e6da\u02bf\u0101m (\u0637\u0639\u0627\u0645, \"food\"); the particular form indicates \"a unit\" of the given root in this case \u1e6c-\u0295-M (\u0637 \u0639 \u0645, having to do with taste and food), thus meaning \"a little piece of food\" or \"small tasty thing\".[10][11][12] The word falafel can refer to the fritters themselves or to sandwiches filled with them. The origin of falafel is uncertain.[13] The dish most likely originated in Egypt.[14][15][16][17][18] It has been speculated that its history may go back to Pharaonic Egypt.[19] However, the earliest written references to falafel from Egyptian sources date to the 19th century,[20][21][22] and oil was probably too expensive to use for deep frying in ancient Egypt.[22][23] As Alexandria is a port city, it was possible to export the dish and its name to other areas in the Middle East.[24] The dish later migrated northwards to the Levant, where chickpeas replaced the fava beans, and from there spread to other parts of the Middle East.[1][25][26] Falafel is a common form of street food or fast food in Egypt, across the Levant, and in the wider Middle East.[2][27] The croquettes are regularly eaten as part of meze. During Ramadan, falafel balls are sometimes eaten as part of the iftar, the meal that breaks the daily fast after sunset.[11] Falafel became so popular that McDonald's for a time served a \"McFalafel\" in its breakfast menu in Egypt.[28] Falafel is still popular in the Coptic diet, and as such large volumes are cooked during religious holidays.[2] Falafel is consumed as part of Lent diet by Arab Christians.[29][30] Waves of migration of Arabs and Turks took falafel through Europe to Germany in particular, where a large Turkish population had put down roots. At first it was a dish consumed principally by migrants. During the early 1970s, the appearance of Turkish food stalls and restaurants made falafel available to the Germans, resulting in a transformation of the recipe.[31] In North America, prior to the 1970s, falafel was found only in Middle Eastern, Mediterranean and Jewish neighborhoods and restaurants.[4][32][33][34] Today, the dish is a common and popular street food in many cities throughout North America.[35][36][37] Falafel became popular among vegetarians and vegans as an alternative to meat-based street foods.[4][40] While traditionally thought of as being used to make veggie burgers,[41] its use has expanded as more have adopted it as a source of protein.[42] Falafel is used as a meat substitute in some vegetarian recipes for meatloaf, sloppy joes and spaghetti and meatballs.[43][44] Falafel is made from fava beans or chickpeas, or a combination of both.[1] Falafel is usually made with fava beans in Egyptian cuisine, where it most likely originated, with chickpeas in Palestinian cuisine,[1] or just chickpeas or a combination of both in Jordan, Lebanon and Syria and the wider Middle East.[2][1][3][45] This version is the most popular in the West.[2] When chickpeas are used, they are not cooked prior to use (cooking the chickpeas will cause the falafel to fall apart, requiring adding some flour to use as a binder). Instead they are soaked (sometimes with baking soda) overnight, then ground together with various ingredients such as parsley, scallions, and garlic.[2] Spices such as cumin and coriander are often added to the beans for added flavor.[46] The dried fava beans are soaked in water and then stone ground with leek, parsley, green coriander, cumin and dry coriander.[47][48] The mixture is shaped into balls or patties. This can be done by hand or with a tool called an aleb falafel (falafel mould).[10] The mixture is usually deep-fried, or it can be oven-baked. Falafel is typically ball-shaped, but is sometimes made in other shapes. The inside of falafel may be green (from green herbs such as parsley or green onion), or tan. Sometimes sesame seeds are added on top of the falafel before frying it. The pita falafel sandwich was popularized after Israel's independence and in the 1950s by Jewish Yemeni immigrants. A 19 October 1939 The Palestine Post article is the first mention of the concept of falafels served in a pita bread as a street food.[49] When served as a sandwich, falafel is often wrapped with flatbread or stuffed in a hollow pita bread,[50] or it can be served with flat or unleavened bread.[51] Tomatoes, lettuce, cucumbers, and other garnishes can be added.[52][53] Falafel is commonly accompanied by tahini sauce.[2] Homemade falafel is 35% water, 32% carbohydrates, 13% protein, and 18% fat (table). In a reference amount of 100 grams (3.5\u00a0oz), homemade falafel supplies 333 calories and is a rich source (20% or more of the Daily Value, DV) of folate (20% DV) and several dietary minerals, particularly manganese (33% DV) (table). Falafel is high in soluble fiber, which has been shown to be effective in lowering blood cholesterol.[54] Falafel can be baked to avoid the high fat content associated with frying in oil.[4][52] Arguments over the relative importance of the dish in various cuisines is an example of gastronationalism.[55] In particular, discussion centers around the adoption of the dish into Israeli cuisine as an example of cultural appropriation.[55] While, according to author Claudia Roden, falafel was \u201cnever specifically a Jewish dish\u201d in Syria and Egypt, it was consumed by Syrian and Egyptian Jews,[13][25] and was adopted in the diet of early Jewish immigrants to the Jewish communities of Ottoman Syria.[5] As it is plant-based, Jewish dietary laws classify it as pareve and thus allow it to be eaten with both meat and dairy meals.[32] Falafel features prominently in Israeli cuisine and has been called a national dish.[5] Some Palestinians and other Arabs have objected to current identification of falafel with Israeli cuisine as cultural appropriation. Palestinian author Reem Kassis wrote that the term, \"Israeli food\" (including falafel) has become a proxy for political conflict.[56][5] Joseph Massad, a Jordanian-American professor at Columbia University, has characterized falafel and other Arab dishes description in American and European restaurants as Israeli to be part of a broader trend of \"colonial conquest\".[57] Dafna Hirsch of the Open University of Israel, wrote: \"Despite Khan Bar-Adon's lament, several ingredients from the Palestinian repertoire did penetrate many Jewish kitchens by the early 1940s, mostly vegetables like olives, tomatoes, eggplants, and squashes. Prepared dishes, however, were rarely adopted, except for falafel, which became a popular street food in Tel Aviv by the late 1930s. Excluding consumption by immigrants from Arab countries, both falafel and, later, hummus seem to have been adopted mainly by the first generation of Jews born in the country.\"[58] Some authors have disagreed on the politics of food and its relative merit as a topic in the conflict.[59] The Association of Lebanese Industrialists in 2008 brought a lawsuit against Israel seeking damages for lost revenues, claiming copyright infringement regarding the branding of Israeli falafel, hummus, tabbouleh, and other foods.[25][26][60] Hot", "Lasagna": " Lasagna (UK: /l\u0259\u02c8z\u00e6nj\u0259/,[1] US: /l\u0259\u02c8z\u0251\u02d0nj\u0259/, Italian: [la\u02c8za\u0272\u0272a]), also known as lasagne (Italian: [la\u02c8za\u0272\u0272e]), is a type of pasta, possibly one of the oldest types,[2] made in very wide, flat sheets. The same-named Italian dish is made of stacked layers of lasagna alternating with fillings such as rag\u00f9 (ground meats and tomato sauce), b\u00e9chamel sauce, vegetables, cheeses (which may include ricotta, mozzarella and Parmesan), and seasonings and spices.[3] The dish may be topped with grated cheese, which becomes melted during baking. Typically cooked pasta is assembled with the other ingredients and then baked in an oven (al forno). The resulting baked pasta is cut into single-serving square or rectangular portions. In ancient Rome, there was a dish similar to a traditional lasagna called lasana or lasanum (Latin for 'container' or 'pot') described in the book De re coquinaria by Marcus Gavius Apicius,[4] but the word could have a more ancient origin. The first theory is that lasagna comes from Greek \u03bb\u03ac\u03b3\u03b1\u03bd\u03bf\u03bd (laganon), a flat sheet of pasta dough cut into strips.[5][6][7][8] The word \u03bb\u03b1\u03b3\u03ac\u03bd\u03b1 (lagana) is still used in Greek to mean a flat thin type of unleavened bread baked for the holiday Clean Monday. Another theory is that the word lasagna comes from the Greek \u03bb\u03ac\u03c3\u03b1\u03bd\u03b1 (lasana) or \u03bb\u03ac\u03c3\u03b1\u03bd\u03bf\u03bd (lasanon) meaning 'trivet', 'stand for a pot' or 'chamber pot'.[9][10][11] The Romans borrowed the word as lasanum, meaning 'cooking pot'.[12] The Italians used the word to refer to the cookware in which lasagna is made. Later the food took on the name of the serving dish. Another proposed link or reference is the 14th century English dish loseyn[13] as described in The Forme of Cury, a cookbook prepared by \"the chief Master Cooks of King Richard II\",[14] which included English recipes as well as dishes influenced by Spanish, French, Italian and Arab cuisines.[15] This dish has similarities to modern lasagna in both its recipe, which features a layering of ingredients between pasta sheets, and its name. An important difference is the lack of tomatoes, which did not arrive in Europe until after Columbus reached the Americas in 1492. The earliest discussion of the tomato in European literature appeared in a herbal written in 1544 by Pietro Andrea Mattioli,[16] while the earliest cookbook found with tomato recipes was published in Naples in 1692, but the author had obtained these recipes from Spanish sources.[16] As with most other types of pasta, the Italian word is a plural form: lasagne meaning more than one sheet of lasagna, although, in many other languages, a derivative of the singular word lasagna is used for the popular baked pasta dish. When referring to the baked dish, regional usage in Italy favours the plural form lasagne in the north of the country and the singular lasagna in the south.[17] The former plural usage has influenced the usual spelling found in British English, while the southern Italian singular usage has influenced the spelling often used in American English.[17]  Both lasagna and lasagne are used as singular non-count (uncountable) nouns in English.[18] Lasagna originated in Italy during the Middle Ages. The oldest transcribed text about lasagna appears in 1282 in the Memoriali Bolognesi ('Bolognese Memorials'), in which lasagna was mentioned in a poem transcribed by a Bolognese notary;[19][20] while the first recorded recipe was set down in the early 14th century Liber de Coquina (The Book of Cookery).[21] It bore only a slight resemblance to the later traditional form of lasagna, featuring a fermented dough flattened into thin sheets, boiled, sprinkled with cheese and spices, and then eaten with a small pointed stick.[22] Recipes written in the century following the Liber de Coquina recommended boiling the pasta in chicken broth and dressing it with cheese and chicken fat. In a recipe adapted for the Lenten fast, walnuts were recommended.[22] Mass-produced lasagne with a ruffled edge is called lasagna riccia, doppio festone, sciab\u00f2 and sciabl\u00f2.[23] In the Veneto, factory-produced lasagne are called bardele or lasagnoni.[23] Narrower lasagne are mezze lasagne, and if with a ruffled edge, mezze lasagne ricche.[23] Similar pastas are the narrower lasagnette and its longer cousin, the lasagnotte (cappellasci [sic] in Liguria[23][24]), as well as the sagne of Salento (the \"heel\" of the Italian \"boot\")[23] and lagana in the remainder of Apulia.[23] The lasagna of Naples, lasagne di carnevale, is layered with local sausage, small fried meatballs, hard-boiled eggs, ricotta and mozzarella cheeses, and sauced with Neapolitan rag\u00f9, a meat sauce.[25] Lasagne al forno, layered with a thicker rag\u00f9 and b\u00e9chamel sauce and corresponding to the most common version of the dish outside Italy, is traditionally associated with the Emilia-Romagna region of Italy. Here, and especially in its capital, Bologna, layers of lasagna are traditionally green (the colour is obtained by mixing spinach or other vegetables into the dough)[26] and served with rag\u00f9 (a thick sauce made from onions, carrots, celery, finely ground pork and beef, butter and tomatoes),[27][28] b\u00e9chamel sauce and Parmesan cheese. In other regions, lasagna can be made with various combinations of ricotta or mozzarella, tomato sauce, meats (such as ground beef, pork, veal or chicken) and vegetables (such as spinach, zucchini, olives and mushrooms), and the dish is typically flavoured with wine, garlic, onion and oregano. In all cases, the lasagne are baked (al forno). Traditionally pasta dough prepared in southern Italy used semolina and water; in the northern regions, where semolina was not available, flour and eggs were used. In modern Italy, since the only type of wheat allowed for commercially sold pasta is durum wheat, industrial lasagna are made of semolina from durum wheat.[29] Nonetheless, in the north and especially in Emilia-Romagna, the tradition of egg-based dough remains popular for artisanal and homemade productions. Media related to Lasagne (layered dish) at Wikimedia Commons Hot", "Paella": " Paella (/pa\u026a\u02c8\u025bl\u0259/,[1] /p\u0251\u02d0\u02c8e\u026aj\u0259/,[2] py-EL-\u0259, pah-AY-y\u0259, Valencian: [pa\u02c8e\u028ea]; Spanish: [pa\u02c8e\u029da]) is a rice dish originally from the Valencian Community. Paella is regarded as one of the community's identifying symbols.[3][4] It is one of the best-known dishes in Spanish cuisine. The dish takes its name from the wide, shallow traditional pan used to cook the dish on an open fire, paella being the word for a frying pan in Valencian/Catalan language. As a dish, it may have ancient roots, but in its modern form, it is traced back to the mid-19th century, in the rural area around the Albufera lagoon adjacent to the city of Valencia, on the Mediterranean coast of Spain.[5] Paella valenciana is the traditional paella of the Valencia region, believed to be the original recipe, and consists of Valencian rice, olive oil, rabbit, chicken, saffron or a substitute, tomato, ferradura or flat green bean, lima beans (Phaseolus lunatus), salt and water.[6] The dish is sometimes seasoned with whole rosemary branches. Traditionally, the yellow color comes from saffron, but turmeric and Calendula can be used as substitutes. Artichoke hearts and stems may be used as seasonal ingredients. Most paella cooks use bomba rice, but a cultivar known as senia is also used in the Valencia region.[7] Paella de marisco (seafood paella) replaces meat with seafood and omits beans and green vegetables, while paella mixta (mixed paella) combines meat from livestock, seafood, vegetables, and sometimes beans, with the traditional rice. Other popular local variations of paella are cooked throughout the Mediterranean area, the rest of Spain, and internationally. Muslims in Al-Andalus began rice cultivation around the 10th century.[8] Consequently, eastern Iberian Peninsula locals often made casseroles of rice, fish, and spices for family gatherings and religious feasts, thus establishing the custom of eating rice in Spain. This led to rice becoming a staple by the 15th century. Afterward, it became customary for cooks to combine rice with vegetables, beans, and dry cod, providing an acceptable meal for Lent. Along Spain's Mediterranean coast, rice was predominantly eaten with fish.[9][10] Spanish food historian Lourdes March notes that the dish \"symbolizes the union and heritage of two important cultures, the Roman, which gives us the utensil and the Arab which brought us the basic food of humanity for centuries: rice.\"[11] Paella is a Valencian word that means frying pan,[12][13][14] from which the dish gets its name.[13][14] Valencian speakers use the word paella for all pans, including the traditional shallow pan used for cooking the homonym dish.[14] The pan is made of polished or coated steel with two side handles.[15] In many regions of Spain and other Spanish-speaking countries, the term paellera may be used for the traditional pan, while paella is reserved for the rice dish prepared in it. Both paella and paellera are correct terms for the pan.[16] According to the etymologist Joan Coromines, the Catalan word paella derives from the Old French word paelle for frying pan, which in turn comes from the Latin word patella for pan; he thinks that otherwise the word should be padella, as inter-vowel -d- dropping is not typical of Old Catalan.[17] The word paella is also related to paila used in many Latin American countries. Paila in Latin American Spanish refers to a variety of cookware resembling metal and clay pans, which are also used for both cooking and serving. The Latin root patella from which paella derives is also akin to the modern French po\u00eale,[18] the Italian padella,[19] and the Old Spanish padilla.[20] Some claim that the word paella comes from the Arabic \u0628\u064e\u0642\u064e\u0627\u064a\u064e\u0627, pronounced baqaayya, meaning \"leftovers.\"[21] This claim is based on the 8th-century custom in which Moorish kings' servants would take home the rice, chicken, and vegetables their employers left at the end of the meal.[22][23][24][25] It has been said, however, that a problem with this etymology is that the word paella is not attested until six centuries after Moorish Valencia was conquered by James I.[26] Originally, paella made in Valencia was a lunchtime meal for farmers and farm laborers. Workers would gather what was available to them around the rice fields. This often included tomatoes, onions, and snails. Rabbit or duck was a common addition, or chicken less often.[27] On special occasions, 18th-century Valencians used calderos to cook the rice in the open air of their orchards near lake Albufera. Water vole meat was one of the main ingredients of early paellas,[28] along with eel and butter beans. Novelist Vicente Blasco Ib\u00e1\u00f1ez described the Valencia custom of eating water voles in Ca\u00f1as y Barro (1902), a realistic novel about life among the fishermen and peasants near lake Albufera.[29] Living standards rose with the sociological changes of the late 19th century in Spain, giving rise to gatherings and outings in the countryside. This led to a change in paella's ingredients, as well, using instead rabbit, chicken, duck, and sometimes snails. The dish became so popular that in 1840, a local Spanish newspaper first used the word paella to refer to the recipe rather than the pan, according to food historian Lynne Olver.[9] The most widely used, complete ingredient list of this era was: short-grain white rice, chicken, rabbit, snails (optional), duck (optional), butter beans, great northern beans, runner beans, artichoke (a substitute for runner beans in the winter), tomatoes, fresh rosemary, sweet paprika, saffron, garlic (optional), salt, olive oil, and water.[9] Poorer Valencians sometimes used only snails for meat.[27] Many Valencians insist that no more than these ingredients should go into making modern paella valenciana, and, in particular, that fish and shellfish are \"absolutely out of the question.\"[30][31] Another important rule, according to Valencians, is that fresh rosemary should not be added to paella valenciana made with rosemary-eating snails.[32] On the Mediterranean coast, Valencian fishermen used seafood instead of meat and beans to make paella. In this recipe, the seafood is served in the shell. Later, Spaniards living outside of Valencia combined seafood with meat from land animals, and mixed paella was born.[33] This paella is sometimes called preparaci\u00f3n barroca (baroque preparation) due to the variety of ingredients and its final presentation.[34] During the 20th century, paella's popularity spread past Spain's borders. As other cultures set out to make paella, the dish invariably acquired regional influences. Consequently, paella recipes went from being relatively simple to including a wide variety of seafood, meat, sausage (including chorizo),[35][36] vegetables and many different seasonings.[37] However, the most globally popular recipe is seafood paella. Throughout non-Valencia Spain, mixed paella is relatively easy to find. Some restaurants in Spain and abroad that serve this mixed version refer to it as Paella valenciana. However, Valencians insist that only the original two Valencia recipes are authentic and view all others as inferior, not genuine, or even grotesque.[33] Other Valencian recipes that have similar preparations are arr\u00f2s a banda and arr\u00f2s del senyoret.[38] According to tradition in Valencia, paella is cooked over an open fire, fueled by orange tree and pine branches and pine cones.[39] This produces an aromatic smoke which infuses the paella.[40] Also, dining guests traditionally eat directly out of the pan instead of serving in plates.[5][9][33][41] Some recipes call for paella to be covered and left to settle for five to ten minutes after cooking.[citation needed] After cooking paella, a layer of scorched rice may be at the bottom of the pan, called socarrat in Valenci\u00e0. The layer develops on its own if the paella is cooked over a burner or open fire. This is traditionally considered positive (as long as it is not burnt), and Valencia natives enjoy eating it.[42] Arroz a la valenciana (Spanish) or Arroz \u00e0 valenciana (Portuguese) is considered as a part of Philippine cuisine. It is considered as the Philippine version of paella.[43] The Philippine version uses glutinous rice; otherwise, the ingredients are the same. In the Philippines, arroz a la valenciana refers to chicken, and longganisa (chorizo) versions.[44] It has become a custom at mass gatherings in the Valencia region (festivals, political campaigns, protests, etc.) to prepare enormous paellas, sometimes to win a place in the Guinness World Records book. Chefs use gargantuan paelleras for these events. Valencia restaurateur Juan Galbis claims to have made the world's largest paella with help from a team of workers on 2 October 2001. This paella fed about 110,000 people, according to Galbis' former website.[45] Galbis says this paella was even larger than his earlier world-record paella made on 8 March 1992, which fed about 100,000 people. Galbis' record-breaking 1992 paella is listed in Guinness World Records.[46] Some non-Spanish chefs include chorizo in their paellas and other ingredients, which Valencian people believe do not belong in paella of any type. The alternative name proposed for these dishes, although pejorative, is arroz con cosas ('rice with things'). Famous cases are Jamie Oliver's paella recipe (which included chorizo)[47][48] and Gordon Ramsay's.[49] The author Josep Pla once noted: \"The abuses committed in the name of Paella Valenciana are excessive \u2013 an absolute scandal.\"[50] However, in an article for El Pa\u00eds, Spanish food writer Ana Vega 'Biscayenne', citing historical references, showed that traditional Valencian paella did indeed include chorizo, exclaiming, \"Ah Jamie, we'll have to invite you to the Falles.\"[51] In 2015, an emoji for paella was proposed to Unicode.[52] The emoji was approved for Unicode 9.0 as U+1F958 \"SHALLOW PAN OF FOOD\" in June 2016. Apple Inc.'s version of the emoji originally depicted Paella de marisco, but was later changed to a more traditional appearance with chicken after online controversy.[53] Traditional Valencian cuisine offers recipes similar to paella valenciana and paella de marisco such as arr\u00f2s negre, arr\u00f2s al forn, arr\u00f2s a banda and arr\u00f2s amb fesols i naps since rice is the base of much of the local cuisine. Fideu\u00e0 is a Valencian pasta noodle dish variation cooked similarly in a paella. It may be served with allioli sauce. Other related dishes: warm", "Moussaka": " Moussaka (/mu\u02d0\u02c8s\u0251\u02d0k\u0259/, UK also /\u02ccmu\u02d0s\u0259\u02c8k\u0251\u02d0/, US also /\u02ccmu\u02d0s\u0251\u02d0\u02c8k\u0251\u02d0/) is an eggplant (aubergine)- or potato-based dish, often including ground meat, which is common in the Balkans and the Middle East, with many local and regional variations. The modern Greek variant was created in the 1920s by Nikolaos Tselementes.[citation needed]  Many versions have a top layer made of milk-based sauce thickened with egg (custard) or flour (b\u00e9chamel sauce). In Greece, the dish is layered and typically served hot. Tselementes also proposed a vegan variant for orthodox fast days. Romania also has a vegan version that replaces meat with mushrooms or a mix of saut\u00e9ed onions and rice. The versions in Egypt, Turkey and the rest of the Middle East are quite different. In Egypt, messa'aa can be made vegan  or vegetarian as well as with meat; in all cases, the main ingredient is the fried eggplant. In Turkey, mussaka consists of thinly sliced and fried eggplant served in a tomato-based meat sauce, warm or at room temperature. In Saudi Arabia, mu\u1e63agga\u2018a is eaten hot, but in other Arab countries, it is often eaten cold, but occasionally hot as well. The English name for moussaka was borrowed from Greek mousak\u00e1s (\u03bc\u03bf\u03c5\u03c3\u03b1\u03ba\u03ac\u03c2) and from other Balkan languages, all borrowed from Ottoman Turkish, which in turn borr\u03bfwed it from Arabic mu\u1e63aqqa\u2018a (\u0645\u0635\u0642\u0639\u0629, lit.\u2009'pounded'  or 'cold'). The word is first attested in English in 1862, written m\u00f9z\u00e0kk\u00e0.[1] Most versions are based primarily on saut\u00e9ed aubergine (eggplant) and tomato, usually with minced meat, mostly lamb. The Greek version includes layers of meat and eggplant topped with a b\u00e9chamel (\"white\") sauce and baked. The modern Greek version was created by the French-trained Greek chef Nikolaos Tselementes in the 1920s.[2][3] His recipe has three layers that are separately cooked before being combined for the final baking: a bottom layer of sliced eggplant saut\u00e9ed in olive oil; a middle layer of ground lamb lightly cooked with chopped or pur\u00e9ed tomatoes, onion, garlic, and spices (cinnamon, allspice and black pepper); and a top layer of b\u00e9chamel sauce or savoury custard.[4] There are variations on this basic recipe, sometimes with no top sauce, sometimes with other vegetables.  Such variants may include, in addition to the eggplant slices, saut\u00e9ed zucchini (courgette) slices, part-fried potato slices, or saut\u00e9ed mushrooms. There is a fast-day (vegan) version in Tselementes' cookbook, which includes neither meat nor dairy products, just vegetables (ground eggplant is used instead of ground meat), tomato sauce, and bread crumbs.[4] Another variant is (melitzanes) papoutsakia (\u03bc\u03b5\u03bb\u03b9\u03c4\u03b6\u03ac\u03bd\u03b5\u03c2) \u03c0\u03b1\u03c0\u03bf\u03c5\u03c4\u03c3\u03ac\u03ba\u03b9\u03b1  (lit.\u2009'eggplant, little shoe style') which consists of whole small eggplants stuffed with ground meat and topped with b\u00e9chamel and baked. In Albania,[5] Bulgaria,[6] the former Yugoslavia,[7][8][9] and Romania, potatoes are used instead of eggplant, pork or beef mince, and the top layer is usually milk or yogurt mixed with raw eggs, sometimes with a small amount of flour added. There is also a three-layer version: the bottom layer consists of ground pork and beef, the middle layer of potato slices, and the top layer is typically a custard. Each layer is cooked on its own and layered in a pan and baked until the top is browned. Typically, the Romanian version is made with potatoes or eggplant or cabbage. The layers start with the vegetable, then the layer of meat (usually pork), then vegetables, until the pot is full. Sometimes bread crumbs are used as a topping, sometimes slices of tomatoes and crushed cheese. The pot is then filled with tomato sauce. There is also a pasta variant, with pasta being used instead of vegetables. The \"fasting\" variant, which is vegan, replaces meat with mushrooms or a mix of saut\u00e9ed onions and rice. In the rest of the Balkans, the top layer is often a custard: this is the version introduced in the UK by Elizabeth David's Mediterranean Cookery and where it remains the usual presentation. Grated cheese or bread crumbs are often sprinkled on top.[citation needed] In the Levant, moussaka is a cooked dish made up primarily of tomatoes and eggplant, similar to Sicilian caponata, and may also include chickpeas. It may be served cold as a mezze dish, or hot. The Egyptian version of moussaka is made from layers of fried eggplant immersed in tomato sauce and then baked. A layer of seasoned cooked ground beef is usually added between the eggplant before baking. The dish can be served hot but is usually chilled for a day or so to improve the taste. Turkish musakka is not layered.[10] Instead, thinly sliced eggplant is fried and served in tomato-based meat sauce seasoned with green peppers, garlic and onions.[11] It is generally eaten with pilav and cac\u0131k. There are also variants with zucchini (courgettes, kabak musakka), carrots (havu\u00e7 musakka) and potatoes (patates musakka). Hot or cold", "Ratatouille": "Ratatouille (/\u02ccr\u00e6t\u0259\u02c8tu\u02d0i/ RAT-\u0259-TOO-ee, French: [\u0281atatuj] \u24d8; Occitan: ratatolha [\u0280ata\u02c8tu\u028e\u0254] \u24d8) is a French Proven\u00e7al dish of stewed vegetables that originated in Nice and is sometimes referred to as ratatouille ni\u00e7oise (French: [niswaz]).[1] Recipes and cooking times differ widely, but common ingredients include tomato, garlic, onion, courgette (zucchini), aubergine (eggplant, brinjal), capsicum (bell pepper), and some combination of leafy green herbs common to the region, such as chives or fennel. The word ratatouille derives from the Occitan ratatolha[2] and is related to the French ratouiller and tatouiller, expressive forms of the verb touiller, meaning \"to stir up\".[3][4] From the late 18th century, in French, it merely indicated a coarse stew. Modern ratatouille uses tomatoes as a foundation for saut\u00e9ed garlic, onion, zucchini (courgette), aubergine (eggplant), bell pepper, marjoram, fennel and basil. Instead of basil, bay leaf and thyme, or a mix of green herbs like herbes de Provence can be used. The modern version does not appear in print until c.1930.[5] The Guardian's food and drink writer Felicity Cloake wrote in 2016 that, considering ratatouille's relatively recent origins (it first appeared in 1877[unreliable source]), there exists a great variety of methods of preparation for it.[6] The Larousse Gastronomique claims \"according to the purists, the different vegetables should be cooked separately, then combined and cooked slowly together until they attain a smooth, creamy consistency\", so that (according to the chair of the Larousse's committee, Jo\u00ebl Robuchon) \"each [vegetable] will taste truly of itself.\"[7] Similar dishes exist in many cuisines. These include: piperade (South-West of France), boh\u00e9mienne (Vaucluse), chichoumeille (Languedoc), tian (South east of France), Confit byaldi (created by Michel Gu\u00e9rard), pisto (Castilian-Manchego, Spain), samfaina (Catalan, Spain),  tombet (Majorcan), ciambotta, caponata and peperonata (Italy),  bri\u00e1m and tourlo\u00fa (Greek), \u015fak\u015fuka and t\u00fcrl\u00fc (Turkish), ajapsandali (Georgian), lecs\u00f3 (Hungarian),  pinakbet (Filipino), ghiveci (Romanian) and zaalouk (Moroccan). Different parts of the Indian subcontinent have their own versions of winter vegetable stew. Gujarat makes undhiyu, Kerala avial (with coconut and local spices), and Bengal shukto. In 2007, Walt Disney Pictures and Pixar Animation Studios released the film Ratatouille. The film features Remy, a young rat with an exceptional sense of taste and smell who dreams of becoming a chef. The climax of the film sees Remy prepare the titular dish in the form of confit byaldi for the notoriously harsh food critic Anton Ego, who unexpectedly loves the dish due to nostalgia for his mother's cooking of traditional ratatouille. The movie gave widespread exposure to this dish around the world.", "Bibimbap": " Bibimbap[1] (/\u02c8bi\u02d0b\u026amb\u00e6p/ BEE-bim-bap;[2] Korean:\u00a0\ube44\ube54\ubc25; lit.\u00a0\"mixed rice\"), sometimes romanized as bi bim bap or bi bim bop, is a Korean rice dish. The term bibim means \"mixing\" and bap is cooked rice. It is served as a bowl of warm white rice topped with namul (saut\u00e9ed or blanched seasoned vegetables) and gochujang (chili pepper paste). Egg and sliced meat (usually beef) are common additions, stirred together thoroughly just before eating.[3] In South Korea, Jeonju, Jinju, and Tongyeong are especially famous for their versions of bibimbap.[4] In 2017, the dish was listed at number 40 on the World's 50 most delicious foods readers' poll compiled by CNN Travel.[5] Bibimbap has gone by a number of names over time. Its earliest names appear in Korean hanja texts. Its first name was hondon-ban (\u6df7\u6c8c\u98ef). This name appeared in the Yeokjogumun (\uc5ed\uc870\uad6c\ubb38; \u6b77\u671d\u820a\u805e) portion of the book Historical Notes of Gijae (\uae30\uc7ac\uc7a1\uae30; \u5bc4\u9f4b\u96dc\u8a18), which was written by Bak Dongnyang (\ubc15\ub3d9\ub7c9; \u6734\u6771\u4eae) around 1590.[6][7][8] In the Diary of Cheongdae by another Joseon scholar Gwon Sang-il (1679\u20131760), it was recorded as goldong-ban (\u9aa8\u8463\u98ef).[9] The dish was also recorded in Complete Works of Seongho by Yi Ik (1681\u20131764) as goldong (\u9aa8\u8463),[7] in Complete Works of Cheongjanggwan by Yi deok-mu (1741\u20131793) as goldong-ban (\u6c68\u8463\u98ef), and in Works of Nakhasaeng by Yi Hak-gyu (1770\u20131835) as both goldong-ban (\u9aa8\u8463\u98ef) and goldong (\u9aa8\u8463).[9] The hangul transcription beubwieum (\ube0c\ubdd4\uc74c) first appears in the 1810 encyclopedia Mongyupyeon by Jang Hon.[8] The 1870 encyclopedia Myeongmul giryak states that the dish name is written as goldong-ban (\u9aa8\u8463\u98ef) in hanja but is read as bubaeban (\u634a\u6392\u98ef), a probable transcription of the native Korean bubim-bap (\ubd80\ube54\ubc25).[9] Another name is beubwieumbap (\ube0c\ubdd4\uc74c\ubc25). The hanja dictionary (\ud55c\ub300\uc790\uc804; \u6f22\u5927\u5b57\u5c55) indeed contained \"bubwida (\ubd80\ubdd4\ub2e4)\" or \"bubwium (\ubd80\ubdd4\uc6c0), Dong (\u8463)\" in hanja, which meant \"mix\" or \"bibida\" in Korean.[6] By the late 19th century, it went by a number of names in hangul: bubwiumbap (\ubd80\ubdd4\uc6c0\ubc25), bubieumbap (\ubd80\ube44\uc74c\ubc25), bubwimbap (\ubd80\ubde4\ubc25), bubuimbap (\ubd80\ube38\ubc25), bubwinbap (\ubd80\ubdd8\ubc25), and bubimbap (\ubd80\ube54\ubc25)bubaeban (\u634a\u6392\u98ef) and goldongban (\u9aa8\u8463\u98ef). Other names in hanja include goldongban (\u9aa8\u8463\u98ef, \u6c68\u8463\u98ef), hondonban (\u6df7\u6c8c\u98ef), and bubaeban (\u634a\u6392\u98ef) and also banyuban (\u76e4\u904a\u98ef).[6] The exact origin of bibimbap is unknown. People could have started mixing bap (rice) with banchan (side dishes) after the outdoor jesa (rites), such as sansinje (rite for mountain gods) or dongsinje (rite for village gods), where they needed to \"eat with the god\" but did not have as many cooking pots and items of crockery to hand as they would normally have at home. Jeonju Bibimbap is an old-fashioned dish.[10] Some scholars assert that bibimbap originates from the traditional practice of mixing all the food offerings made at an jesa (ancestral rite) in a bowl before partaking of it.[11] Ordinary people ate bibimbap on the eve of the lunar new year as the people at that time felt that they had to get rid of all of the leftover side dishes before the new year. The solution to this problem was to put all of the leftovers in a bowl of rice and to mix them together.[12] Farmers ate bibimbap during farming season as it was the easiest way to make food for a large number of people.[13] Bibimbap was served to the king, usually as a lunch or a between-meal snack.[14] There was more than vegetables in this bibimbap.[15] In Collected Works of Oju written by Yi Gyu-gyeong (1788\u20131856), recorded varieties of bibimbap, such as vegetable bibimbap, miscellany bibimbap, hoe bibimbap, shad bibimbap, prawn bibimbap, salted shrimp bibimbap, shrimp roe bibimbap, marinated crab bibimbap, wild chive bibimbap, fresh cucumber bibimbap, gim flake bibimbap, gochujang bibimbap, soybean sprout bibimbap, and also stated that bibimbap was a local specialty of Pyongyang, along with naengmyeon and gamhongno.[7][9] The first known recipe for bibimbap is found in the Siuijeonseo, an anonymous cookbook from the late 19th century.[16][17][18] The late 20th century brought about the globalization of the Korean culture, traditions, and food to many areas of the world with many restaurant chains being opened up in various international airports that encourage the sale of bibimbap.[19] Bibimbap is an extensively customizable food with a variety of ingredients that can be used in its creation. It has existed in Korea for centuries and even has a place in society today. It came from early rural Koreans taking leftover vegetables, sometimes having meat, with rice and mixing them in a bowl. This was cheap and did not require all of the time and space of a traditional meal.[20] There are two separate ancient writings that suggest the original reasoning behind the creation and use of bibimbap. The first one, \"People's Unofficial Story of Jeonju\" (\u5168\u5dde\u91ce\u53f2), tells of Jeonju bibimbap being used in occasions such as parties that included government officials of provincial offices. The second being, \"Lannokgi\" (\u862d\u7da0\u8a18), which told of bibimbap being made by the wives, of farmers, who had no time to prepare meals the traditional way with many side dishes, and instead they were able to throw most of the ingredients in a bowl sometimes adding whatever they happened to be cultivating.[20]  Although bibimbap was originally rarely mentioned and mostly only in hanja records, it began to be more frequently referenced and in Hangul (Korean alphabets) records as well upon the creation of Hangul by the King Sejong the Great to improve the state's literacy.[20] The division of Korea in the 20th century caused a cultural divide in the creation of bibimbap with two types related to both North and South Korea. The most famous regions for traditional bibimbap happen to be Pyongyang for its vegetable bibimbap in the North and Jeonju for its Jeonju bibimbap.[20] In the late 20th century, bibimbap started to become widespread in many countries in the West, due to its simplicity, cheap cost, and delicious taste. Many airlines connecting to South Korea via Incheon International Airport began to serve it, and it was accepted more globally as a popular Korean dish.[21] Bibimbap has also been described as a symbol of the Korean culture to non-Koreans due to Korea becoming more acceptable to foreigners and multicultural traditions.[19] Bibimbap can be various kinds of bibimbap depending on the ingredients. Vegetables commonly used in bibimbap include julienned oi (cucumber), aehobak (courgette/zucchini), mu (radish), mushrooms, doraji (bellflower root), and gim, as well as spinach, soybean sprouts, and gosari (bracken fern stems). Dubu (tofu), either plain or saut\u00e9ed, or a leaf of lettuce may be added, or chicken or seafood may be substituted for beef.[3] For visual appeal, the vegetables are often placed so adjacent colors complement each other. In the South Korean version, sesame oil, red pepper paste (gochujang), and sesame seeds are added.[21] Jeonju is a South Korean province known for its long standing food preparation style, which has been praised and passed down throughout thousands of years. Jeonju is the most famous place for Bibimbap. Jeonju bibimbap along with kongnamul-gukbap (bean sprout and rice soup) are signature dishes of Jeonju.[22] Jeonju bibimbap is one of the most popular dishes in Korea and around the world. It is usually topped with quality Jeonju soy bean sprouts, hwangpo-muk, gochujang, jeopjang, and seasoned raw beef and served with kongnamul-gukbap. The rice of Jeonju bibimbap is specially prepared by being cooked in beef shank broth for flavor and finished with sesame oil for flavor and nutrients.[22] Jeonju also holds a Jeonju Bibimbap Festival every year.[23] Hot stone pot bibimbap (dolsot-bibimbap, \ub3cc\uc1a5 \ube44\ube54\ubc25)[1] is a variation of bibimbap served in a very hot dolsot (stone pot) in which a raw egg is cooked against the sides of the bowl. The bowl is so hot that anything that touches it sizzles for minutes. Before the rice is placed in the bowl, the bottom of the bowl is coated with sesame oil, making the layer of the rice touching the bowl cook to a crisp, golden brown known as nurungji (\ub204\ub989\uc9c0). This variation of bibimbap is typically served to order, with the egg and other ingredients mixed in the pot just prior to consumption. Yakcho-bibimbap (\uc57d\ucd08\ube44\ube54\ubc25) is from Jecheon. Yak (\uc57d) is a historical term for medicinal. Jecheon is a great place for medicinal herbs to grow. People could get a thicker root and more medicinal herb than other areas. The combination of the medicinal herbs and popular bibimbap made it one of the most popular foods in Jecheon.[24] Hoedeopbap (\ud68c\ub36e\ubc25) is a bibimbap with a variety of raw seafood, such as tilapia, salmon, tuna or sometimes octopus, but each bowl of rice usually contains only one variety of seafood. The term hoe in the word means raw fish. The dish is popular along the coasts of Korea where fish are abundant.[citation needed] Some people[who?] attach symbolism to the ingredients of bibimbap. Black or dark colours represent north and the kidneys \u2013 for instance, shiitake mushrooms, bracken ferns or nori seaweed. Red or orange represents south and the heart, with chilli, carrots, and jujube dates. Green represents east and the liver, with cucumber and spinach. White is west or the lungs, with foods such as bean sprouts, radish, and rice. Yellow represents the centre, or stomach. Foods include pumpkin, potato or egg.[26]", "Peking Duck": "Peking duck is a dish from Beijing[a] that has been prepared since the Imperial era. The meat is characterized by its thin, crispy skin, with authentic versions of the dish serving mostly the skin and little meat, sliced in front of the diners by the cook. Ducks bred especially for the dish are slaughtered after 65 days and seasoned before being roasted in a closed or hung oven. The meat is often eaten with spring onion, cucumber, and sweet bean sauce, with pancakes rolled around the fillings. Sometimes pickled radish is also inside. Crispy aromatic duck is a similar dish to Peking duck and is popular in the United Kingdom. Duck has been roasted in China since the Southern and Northern dynasties.[1] A variation of roast duck was prepared for the emperor of China in the Yuan dynasty. The dish, originally named \"sh\u0101o y\u0101zi\" (\u71d2\u9d28\u5b50), was mentioned in the Complete Recipes for Dishes and Beverages (\u98f2\u81b3\u6b63\u8981) manual in 1330 by Hu Sihui (\u5ffd\u601d\u6167), an inspector of the imperial kitchen.[2][3] The Peking roast duck that came to be associated with the term was fully developed during the later Ming dynasty,[1][4][5] and by then, Peking duck was one of the main dishes on imperial court menus.[6] The first restaurant specialising in Peking duck, Bianyifang, was established in the Xianyukou, close to Qianmen of Beijing in 1416.[7] By the Qianlong period (1736\u20131796) of the Qing dynasty, the popularity of Peking duck spread to the upper classes, inspiring some poets and scholars who enjoyed the dish. For instance, one verse of D\u016bm\u00e9n zh\u00fazh\u012bc\u00ed, a Beijing local poem, was \"Fill your plates with roast duck and suckling pig\".[8]\n[9] In 1864, the Quanjude (\u5168\u805a\u5fb7) restaurant was established in Beijing. Yang Quanren (\u694a\u5168\u4ec1), the founder of Quanjude, developed the hung oven to roast ducks.[citation needed] By the mid-20th century, Peking duck had become a national symbol of China, favored by tourists and diplomats alike. For example, Henry Kissinger, the secretary of state of the United States, met Premier Zhou Enlai in the Great Hall of the People on 10 July 1971, during his first (secret) visit to China. After a round of inconclusive talks in the morning, the delegation was served Peking duck for lunch, which became Kissinger's favourite. The Americans and Chinese issued a joint statement the following day, inviting President Richard Nixon to visit China in 1972. Following Zhou's death in 1976, Kissinger paid another visit to Beijing to savor Peking duck.[10][11] Peking duck, at the Quanjude in particular, has also been a favorite dish for various political leaders ranging from Cuban Fidel Castro to former German chancellor Helmut Kohl.[12][13] Two notable restaurants in Beijing which serve this dish are Quanjude and Bianyifang, both centuries-old establishments which have become household names, each with their own style: Quanjude is known for using the hung oven roasting method, while Bianyifang uses the oldest technique of closed oven roasting.[14][15] The ducks used to prepare Peking duck originated in Nanjing. They were large, had black feathers, and lived in the canals that linked the city to major waterways. With the relocation of the Chinese capital to Beijing, supply barge traffic increased in that area. Often these barges spilled water into side-canals, providing a habitat for the ducks. By the time of adoption of five-spice powder, a new breed of duck had been domesticated by Chinese farmers.[16] Nowadays, Peking duck is prepared from the American Pekin[failed verification] duck (Anas platyrhynchos domestica).[17] Newborn ducks are raised in a free range environment for the first 45\u00a0days of their lives, and force fed 4\u00a0times a day for the next 15\u201320\u00a0days, resulting in ducks that weigh 5\u20137\u00a0kg (11\u201315\u00a0lbs).[18] The force feeding of the ducks led to an alternate name for the animal, \"Peking stuffed duck\" (simplified Chinese: \u5317\u4eac\u586b\u9e2d; traditional Chinese: \u5317\u4eac\u586b\u9d28; pinyin: b\u011bij\u012bng ti\u00e1n y\u0101).[19] Fattened ducks are killed, plucked, eviscerated and rinsed thoroughly with water. Air is pumped under the skin through the neck cavity to separate the skin from the fat.[20] The duck is then blanched in boiling hot water for two to three minutes before it is hung up to dry. This tightens the skin.[21] While it is hung, the duck is glazed with a layer of syrup with honey, and the duck's inside is rinsed once more with water.[22][23] A second layer of glaze/marinade of soy sauce, five-spice powder, and more maltose is then applied inside and out, and the duck is left to stand for 24\u00a0hours in a cool, dry place (or a refrigerator).[24] It is then roasted in an oven until the skin turns shiny brown.[25] Besides two traditional methods to prepare Peking duck, recipes have been compiled by chefs all around the world to produce the dish at home.[20][21] Peking duck is traditionally roasted in a closed oven (Chinese: \u7116\u7089). Bianyifang, a restaurant in Beijing, China, is famous for keeping this tradition. The closed oven is built of brick and fitted with metal griddles (Chinese: \u7b85\u5b50; pinyin: b\u00ec zi). The oven is preheated by burning Gaoliang sorghum straw (Chinese: \u79eb\u79f8; pinyin: sh\u00fa ji\u0113) at the base. The duck is placed in the oven immediately after the fire burns out, allowing the meat to be slowly cooked through the convection of heat within the oven.[citation needed] Controlling the fuel and the temperature is the main skill. In closed-oven style, duck meat is combined well with the fat under the skin, and therefore is juicy and tender.[citation needed] The open oven (Chinese: \u6302\u7089; lit. 'hung oven') was developed in the imperial kitchens during the Qing dynasty and adopted by the Quanjude restaurant chain. It is designed to roast up to 20\u00a0ducks at the same time with an open fire fueled by hardwood from peach or pear trees.[24] The ducks are hung on hooks above the fire and roasted at a temperature of 270\u00a0\u00b0C (518\u00a0\u00b0F) for 30\u201340\u00a0minutes. While the ducks are roasting, the chef may use a pole to dangle each duck closer to the fire for 30-second intervals.[24] In open-oven style, the fat is usually melted during the cooking process, so the skin is crispy.[citation needed] Peking duck is traditionally carved in front of the guests and served in three stages. First, slices of duck skin are served with sugar and sweet bean sauce as a dip. Duck skin is best enjoyed hot and crisp to the bite. The meat is then served with steamed pancakes (simplified Chinese: \u6625\u997c; traditional Chinese: \u6625\u9905; pinyin: ch\u016bn b\u01d0ng) and an assortment of vegetable dishes, typically julienned cucumber and spring onion. Traditionally, diners dip slices of duck into the condiments and wrap into the pancake with cucumber and any other ingredients. The wrap is then eaten by hand or with chopsticks. The carved duck (\u9e2d\u67b6) \u2013 the remainder of the roast duck, with choice cuts removed \u2013 can be cooked in three ways. The traditional way is in a broth with ingredients such as Chinese cabbage and soft tofu. The carved duck can also be chopped and stir-fried in sweet bean sauce, or rapidly saut\u00e9ed and served with salt and pepper (\u6912\u9e7d). Otherwise, the carved duck is packed to be taken home by the customers.[26][27][28] Whole Peking ducks can be ordered as takeaway. The ducks can be reheated at home with an oven or stove. When an oven is used, the duck is heated at a temperature of 150\u00a0\u00b0C (302\u00a0\u00b0F) for 20 minutes, and then at 160\u00a0\u00b0C (320\u00a0\u00b0F) for another 10 minutes. The stove method involves submerging the duck in boiling water before placing it on a griddle 70\u00a0cm (28\u00a0in) above the cooking fire. The water is replaced every 3\u20134 minutes until the duck is piping hot. To reheat the Peking duck with oil, the duck is sliced into thin pieces and placed in a strainer held over a wok of hot oil. The duck is then rinsed several times with the oil.[28] A number of restaurants in Beijing specialise in Peking duck. Examples include Quanjude, Bianyifang, Changan Yihao (\u9577\u5b89\u4e00\u865f), Dayali, Beijing Xiaowangfu (\u5317\u4eac\u5c0f\u738b\u5e9c) and Dadong Kaoyadian (\u5927\u8463\u70e4\u9d28\u5e97).[29] Some restaurants, in particular Quanjude and Bianyifang, have long histories of serving high quality duck that they are now household names, or Lao zihao (\u8001\u5b57\u53f7), literally \"old brand name\".[30] In addition, Quanjude has received worldwide recognition, having been named a China Renowned Trademark in 1999.[31] Duck Chang's Restaurant, established in 1975 in Virginia, United States, was the first Chinese restaurant to prepare and serve Peking duck without a 24-hour advanced notice.[32] In 2018, the James Beard Foundation awarded Sun Wah BBQ in Chicago, Illinois, with their America's Classics award, specifically citing Sun Wah's three-course \"Beijing Duck Feast\" in their announcement of the award.[33] Crispy aromatic duck (\u9999\u9165\u9d28 xi\u0101ng s\u016b y\u0101) is a similar dish to Peking duck. It is popular in the United Kingdom,[34] where it was created in the latter half of the twentieth century.[35] The duck is first marinated with spices, then steamed until tender, and finally deep fried until crispy.[36] The meat has less fat and is drier and crispier compared to that of Peking duck.[37] In Germany, some Asian fusion restaurants also serve crispy aromatic duck (Knusprige Ente), sometimes also labeled as Peking duck (Peking-Ente, also Pekingente). The duck is marinated with spices and deep-fried, served together with stir-fried vegetables (Wokgem\u00fcse) over fried noodles or with rice.[38][39]", "Croissant": " A croissant (UK: /\u02c8krw\u028cs\u0252\u0303, \u02c8krw\u00e6s\u0252\u0303/,[1] US: /kr\u0259\u02c8s\u0252nt, krw\u0251\u02d0\u02c8s\u0252\u0303/; French: [k\u0281was\u0251\u0303] \u24d8) is a French pastry made from puff pastry in a crescent shape.[2] It is a buttery, flaky, viennoiserie pastry inspired by the shape of the Austrian kipferl, but using the French yeast-leavened laminated dough.[3] Croissants are named for their historical crescent shape. The dough is layered with butter, rolled and folded several times in succession, then rolled into a thin sheet, in a technique called laminating. The process results in a layered, flaky texture, similar to a puff pastry. Crescent-shaped breads have been made since the Renaissance, and crescent-shaped cakes possibly since antiquity.[4] The modern croissant was developed in the early 20th century, when French bakers replaced the brioche dough of the kipferl with a yeast-leavened laminated dough.[5] In the late 1970s, the development of factory-made, frozen, preformed but unbaked dough made them into a fast food that could be freshly baked by unskilled labor. The croissant bakery, notably the La Croissanterie chain, was a French response to American-style fast food,[6] and as of 2008, 30\u201340% of the croissants sold in French bakeries and patisseries were baked from frozen dough.[7] Croissants are a common part of a continental breakfast in many European countries. The kipferl, an Austrian crescent-shaped pastry, can be dated back to at least the 13th century in Austria, and came in various shapes.[8][9] The kipferl can be made plain or with nuts or other fillings (some consider the rugelach a form of kipferl).[10] In either 1838 or 1839, an Austrian artillery officer, August Zang, founded a Viennese bakery (\"Boulangerie Viennoise\") at 92, rue de Richelieu in Paris.[9][11] This bakery, which served Viennese specialties including the kipferl and the Vienna loaf, quickly became popular and inspired French imitators (and the concept, if not the term, of viennoiserie, a 20th-century term for supposedly Vienna-style pastries). The French version of the kipferl was named for its crescent (croissant) shape and has become a universally identifiable shape across the world.[citation needed] The earliest known recipe for the present-day croissant appears in 1905, although the name croissant appears among the \"fantasy or luxury breads\" in 1853.[12] Earlier recipes for non-laminated croissants can be found in the 19th century and at least one reference to croissants as an established French bread appeared as early as 1850.[13] Zang himself returned to Austria in 1848 to become a press magnate, but the bakery remained popular for some time afterwards, and was mentioned in several works of the time: \"This same M. Zank  [sic]...founded around 1830 [sic], in Paris, the famous Boulangerie viennoise\".[14] Several sources praise this bakery's products: \"Paris is of exquisite delicacy; and, in particular, the succulent products of the Boulangerie Viennoise\";[15] \"which seemed to us as fine as if it came from the Viennese bakery on the rue de Richelieu\".[16] By 1869, the croissant was well established enough to be mentioned as a breakfast staple,[17] and in 1872, Charles Dickens wrote (in his periodical All the Year Round) of \"the workman's pain de m\u00e9nage and the soldier's pain de munition, to the dainty croissant on the boudoir table\"[18] The puff pastry technique that now characterizes the croissant was already mentioned in the late 17th century, when La Varenne's Le Cuisinier fran\u00e7ois gave a recipe for it in the 1680 \u2013 and possibly earlier \u2013 edition. It was typically used not on its own but for shells holding other ingredients (as in a vol-au-vent). It does not appear to be mentioned in relation to the croissant until the 20th century. The first recipe corresponding to the modern croissant, not only for the shape but also the texture of the dough and the taste, was published in 1906, in Paris, in Colombi\u00e9's Nouvelle Encyclop\u00e9die culinaire.[19] Sylvain Claudius Goy was a French chef who is sometimes said to have recorded the earliest recipe of the modern croissant.[20] His 1915 book La Cuisine Anglo-Americaine contains a croissant recipe which Frey Fine Books consider to be the first such recipe published, and they describe the recipe as having \"[given] birth to the croissant of present day\".[21] Goy's recipe uses a laminated yeast dough known in French as p\u00e2te feuillet\u00e9e lev\u00e9e.[citation needed] Stories of how the kipferl \u2014 sometimes confused with the croissant \u2014 was created are widespread and persistent culinary legends, going back to the 19th century.[22] However, there are no contemporary sources for any of these stories, and an aristocratic writer, writing in 1799, does not mention the kipferl in a long and extensive list of breakfast foods.[23] The legends include tales that it was invented in Europe to celebrate the defeat of the Umayyad forces by the Franks at the Battle of Tours in 732, with the shape representing the Islamic crescent; that it was invented in Buda; or, according to other sources, in Vienna in 1683 to celebrate the defeat of the Ottomans by Christian forces in the siege of the city, as a reference to the crescents on the Ottoman flags, when bakers staying up all night heard the tunneling operation and gave the alarm.[22] The Islamic origin story seems to have originated with the 20th-century writer Alfred Gottschalk, who gave two versions:[24] According to one of a group of similar legends, which vary only in detail, a baker of the 17th century, working through the night at a time when his city (either Vienna in 1683 or Budapest in 1686) was under siege by the Turks, heard faint underground rumbling sounds which, on investigation, proved to be caused by a Turkish attempt to invade the city by tunneling under the walls. The tunnel was blown up. The baker asked no reward other than the exclusive right to bake crescent-shaped pastries commemorating the incident, the crescent being the symbol of Islam. He was duly rewarded in this way, and the croissant was born.The story seems to owe its origin, or at least its wide diffusion, to Alfred Gottschalk, who wrote about the croissant for the first edition of the Larousse Gastronomique (1938) and there gave the legend in the 'Turkish attack on Budapest in 1686' version; but who subsequently, in his own book (1948) on the history of food, opted for the 'siege of Vienna in 1683' version.[25] For this reason, the Islamic State attempted to ban croissants during the Syrian civil war.[26] Uncooked croissant dough can also be wrapped around any praline, almond paste, or chocolate before it is baked (in the last case, it becomes like pain au chocolat, which has a different, non-crescent, shape), or sliced to include sweet or savoury fillings. It may be flavored with dried fruit such as sultanas or raisins, or other fruits such as apples. In France and Spain, croissants are generally sold without filling and eaten without added butter, but sometimes with almond filling. In the United States, sweet fillings or toppings are sometimes used, and warm croissants may be filled with ham and cheese, or feta cheese and spinach. In the Levant, croissants are sold plain or filled with chocolate, cheese, almonds, or zaatar. In Germany, croissants are sometimes filled with Nutella or persipan; in southern Germany, there is also a popular variety of a croissant glazed with lye (Laugencroissant). In the German-speaking part of Switzerland, the croissant is typically called a Gipfeli; this usually has a crisper crust and is less buttery than the French-style croissant. Croissants are commonly served alongside coffee for breakfast, aperitivo (a light mid-morning meal), or merienda (a mid-afternoon meal). They are referred to as medialunas (\"half moons\") because of their shape and are typically coated with a sweet glaze (medialunas de manteca, \"half moons of butter\"). Another variant is a medialuna de grasa (\"half moon of lard\"), which is not always sweet. A cousin of the croissant is the Italian cornetto (in the center and south) or brioche (in the north). These variants are often considered to be the same, but that is not completely true: the French version tends to be crispy, whereas an Italian cornetto or brioche is usually softer. Furthermore, the cornetto vuoto (lit.\u2009'empty cornetto') is commonly accompanied by variants with filling, which include crema pasticciera (custard), apricot jam or chocolate cream. They often come covered with powdered sugar or other toppings. Cornetto with cappuccino at the bar is one of the most common breakfasts in Italy.[citation needed] On 11 November, St. Martin's Day is celebrated in the Polish region of Greater Poland, mainly in its capital city Pozna\u0144. On this day, the people of Pozna\u0144 purchase and eat considerable amounts of sweet, crescent-shaped pastries called rogale \u015bwi\u0119tomarci\u0144skie (\"St. Martin's croissants\"). They are made specially for this occasion from puff pastry filled with ground white poppy seeds, almonds, raisins, and nuts. The first type of Portuguese croissant is similar to the French, and can be plain or filled with custard, chocolate, fruit jam, or a typical Portuguese cream made of egg yolk and sugar, \"doce de ovo\". It is customary for these to also have powdered sugar on top. The second version has a similar consistency to brioche and is commonly eaten with ham and cheese. Sometimes this type is also served like toast, with a spread of butter. While the first type of croissant is considered sweet and is eaten during breakfast or tea, the second type is a more filling meal and is usually considered a sandwich and often prepared for picnics or as travel food. Both types share the same name (French/Portuguese: \"croissant\") but are typically found in different bakeries: the sweet croissant is more commonly found in Portuguese p\u00e2tisseries and the brioche croissant is usually found in coffeehouses.[citation needed] Besides the regular croissant, a variation called Xuixos (pronounced [\u0283u\u0283u])[27] is sold. It is half of a croissant, usually stuffed with cream. A pastry with croissant shape is the Turkish ay \u00e7\u00f6re\u011fi. It is filled with cinnamon, walnut, hazelnut, cacao and raisin.[28] Its rectangular shape variant is known as pasti\u00e7 or \u0130zmir \u00e7\u00f6re\u011fi.[29] It is generally eaten during breakfast or with tea. The first step of manufacturing croissants is the \"predough\" formation. To prepare predough, flour, water, in-dough fat, yeast, salt, and sugar are mixed together in a single step.[30] Typically, croissant predough is mixed in a relatively cool environment, for a longer time than other pastries. The ideal temperature of the dough should be around 19\u00a0\u00b0C (66\u00a0\u00b0F), to best hydrate the ingredients.[31] In comparison to the mixing of bread dough ingredients, pastry predough is considered underdeveloped in that mixing is stopped as soon as the dough appears homogeneous, to allow for further dough development in the next step.[30] The second step is the lamination process. Lamination is necessary to produce multilayered dough with alternating layers of predough and fat. Generally, there are two methods for folding fat into the dough: the English method and the French method. In the English method, one fold results in two fat layers and three dough layers.[32] After spreading out predough, roll-in fat is flattened to a similar thickness as the predough and spread over two-thirds of the surface of the laminated predough. The exposed third of predough is then folded over half of the roll-in fat, while the other end (one predough and one fat layer) is folded on top. In the French method, one fold results in one fat layer and two dough layers. After spreading out the predough and putting a layer of roll-in fat over the center surface of the dough, the corners of the predough are folded toward the middle of the fat. Croissant dough is typically laminated until 16\u201350 fat layers are obtained.[30] The optimal number of layers can be determined by balancing certain crumb properties with specific volume. On one hand, a low number of layers yields large specific heights as well as irregular crumb structure with large voids. On the other hand, a large number of relatively thin layers leads to interconnections between different dough layers as well as less dough lift. After lamination, the dough is formed into its famous crescent shape. First, the laminated dough is cut into triangles of the desired size. The triangles are then rolled with three-and-a-half to four full turns, and finally, the ends of the roll are curved inwards to form a crescent.[31] The third step is the fermentation process. Croissants are different from other puff pastries in that they include yeast, which, during proofing, increases the dough volume. Ideally, the optimum croissant quality is achieved at a yeast level of 7.5%, with a proof time of 60 minutes at 31\u00a0\u00b0C (88\u00a0\u00b0F).[32] The croissants are finished proofing when the dough has expanded two-and-a-half times its original volume.[31] The fourth step is the baking process. Also known as \"pastry lift\" or \"dough lift\", the dough expands as water is converted to steam, thus increasing the pressure between each dough layer. As a result, the croissant dough rises up to yield its characteristic flaky texture.[30] Depending on the type of oven used and specific size of the croissant, the baking time can range from 10 to 20 minutes and the oven temperature can be set anywhere from 165 to 205\u00a0\u00b0C (329 to 401\u00a0\u00b0F).[31] The final steps are the cooling and storage of the croissant. Croissants are generally not stored for very long and are typically consumed soon after baking. Gluten proteins affect the water absorption and viscoelastic properties of the predough.[30] The role of proteins can be divided into two stages of dough formation: hydration and deformation. In the hydration stage, gluten proteins absorb water up to two times their own weight. In the deformation or kneading stage, the action of mixing causes the gluten to undergo a series of polymerization and depolymerization reactions, forming a viscoelastic network. Hydrated glutenin proteins in particular help form a polymeric protein network that makes the dough more cohesive. On the other hand, hydrated gliadin proteins do not directly form the network, but do act as plasticizers of the glutenin network, thus imparting fluidity to the dough\u2019s viscosity.[33] Starch also affects the viscosity of predough. At room temperature and in a sufficient amount of water, intact starch granules can absorb water up to 50% of their own dry weight, causing them to swell to a limited extent.[34] The slightly swollen granules are found in the spaces between the gluten network, thus contributing to the consistency of the dough. The granules may not be intact, as the process of milling wheat into flour damages some of the starch granules. Given that damaged starch granules have the capacity to absorb around three times as much water as undamaged starch, the use of flour with higher levels of damaged starch requires the addition of more water to achieve optimal dough development and consistency.[30] Water content affects the mechanical behavior of predough.[30] As previously discussed, water is absorbed by gluten and starch granules to increase the viscosity of the dough. The temperature of the water is also important as it determines the temperature of the predough. In order to facilitate processing, cold water should be used for two main reasons. First, chilled water provides a desirable environment for gluten development, as the temperature at which mixing occurs impacts the dough\u2019s hydration time, consistency, and required amount of mixing energy.[35] Secondly, cold water is comparable to the temperature of the roll-in fat to be added later, which better facilitates the latter\u2019s incorporation.[30] In-dough fat affects the texture and lift of predough. Although higher levels of dough fat may lower dough lift during baking, it also correlates with a softer end product.[30] As such, the main function of in-dough fat is to produce a desirable softness in the final croissant. In laminated croissant dough, the gluten network is not continuous. Instead, the gluten proteins are separated as thin gluten films between dough layers. The formation of thin, well-defined layers affects the height of dough lift. Generally, laminated croissant dough contains fewer layers than other puff pastry doughs that do not contain yeast, due to the presence of small bubbles in the gluten sheets. Upon proofing, these bubbles expand and destroy the integrity of the dough layers.[32] The resulting interconnections between different dough layers would over-increase dough strength and allow water vapor to escape through micropores during baking, consequently decreasing dough lift. The role of fat also influences the separation of layers, as will be discussed next. Roll-in fat affects the flakiness and flavor of the croissant. In laminated dough, fat layers alternate with dough layers. As such, the most important function of roll-in fat is to form and maintain a barrier between the different dough layers during sheeting and folding.[30] As previously stated, the ability for fat to maintain separation between folded dough layers ensures proper dough lift. The type of roll-in fat used is typically butter or margarine. Butter and margarine are both water-in-oil emulsions, composed of stabilized water droplets dispersed in oil.[36] While butter is appealing due to its high consumer acceptance, its low melting point, 32\u00a0\u00b0C (90\u00a0\u00b0F), actually makes it undesirable for production purposes. The use of butter as roll-in fat during the lamination step will cause problems of oiling out during sheeting and fermentation if the temperature is not tightly controlled, thus disrupting the integrity of the layers.[30] On the other hand, kinds of margarine are commonly used as roll-in fat because they facilitate dough handling. Generally, roll-in margarine should have a melting point between 40 and 44\u00a0\u00b0C (104 and 111\u00a0\u00b0F), at least 3\u00a0\u00b0C (37\u00a0\u00b0F) higher than the fermentation temperature to prevent oiling out prior to baking. It is also important to consider the plasticity and firmness of the roll-in fat, which is largely determined by its solid fat content. Generally, a greater proportion of solid fat coincides with larger croissant lift.[37] At the same time, the roll-in fat should have plasticity comparable to that of the dough, such that the fat layers do not break during sheeting and folding.[30] If the fat is firmer than the dough, then the dough can rupture. If the fat is softer than the dough, then it will succumb to the mechanical stress of sheeting and potentially migrate into the dough. Croissants contain yeast, Saccharomyces cerevisiae, which is incorporated during predough formation. When oxygen is abundant, the yeast breaks down sugar into carbon dioxide and water through the process of respiration.[38] This process releases energy that is used by the yeast for growth. After consuming all of the oxygen, the yeast switches to anaerobic fermentation. At this point, the yeast partially breaks down sugar into ethanol and carbon dioxide. Once CO2 saturates the dough\u2019s aqueous phase, the gas begins to leaven the dough by diffusing to preexisting gas cells that were incorporated into the predough during mixing.[30] Yeast action does not produce new gas cells, as the immense pressure required for a single CO2 molecule to create a new gas bubble is not physically attainable[39] In order to ensure the flaky texture of the croissant, it is important to balance the yeast activity with steam production. If the yeast overproduces CO2, then the well-defined layers may collapse.[37] During the baking process, this would cause steam to escape too early from the bread, reducing dough lift and flakiness of the final product. Thus, to offset the negative effects of yeast on layer integrity and dough lift, croissants usually contain fewer layers than other puff pastries. During baking, the transient gluten network turns into a permanent network.[40] At higher temperatures, intermolecular disulfide bonds form between glutenin molecules, as well as between gliadin and glutenin. With more bonds being made, the gluten network becomes more rigid, strengthening the croissant\u2019s crumb texture. Additionally, the baking process significantly stretches the dough layers due to the large macroscopic deformation that occurred during fermentation\u2019s dough lift.[30] Starch undergoes gelatinization as a result of baking.[34] Prior to baking, starch granules absorb a small amount of water at room temperature as it is mixed with water to form predough. As long as the dough\u2019s temperature stays under the gelatinization temperature, this granule swelling is limited and reversible. However, once the baking process begins and the dough is exposed to temperatures above the gelatinization temperature, amylopectin crystallites become more disordered inside the starch granules and cause an irreversible destruction of molecular order.[30] At the same time, starch gelatinization actively draws water from the gluten network, further decreasing the flexibility of the gluten. Currently, the extent of amylose leaching and granular structure distortion during the baking of croissants is still unknown. Roll-in fat gradually melts as the temperature in the oven increases. Some of the melting fat can migrate into the dough, which could then interfere with gluten protein crosslinking.[41] The fat phase also contributes to dough lift through gas inflation, which will be described next. Water is converted to steam during the baking process, which is the main factor behind the leavening of the dough. The water for steam production comes from both the dough layers and the roll-in fat. As the fat melts, the continuous oil phase is no longer able to stabilize the water droplets, which are then released and converted to steam.[42] Although the exact mechanism of steam entrapment is still unclear, it is likely a result of both steam expanding inside each dough layer and steam migrating to oil layers, where it inflates gas bubbles. The steam migration to oil phase is likely due to the smaller pressure differential required to inflate a bubble of steam in liquid fat than in solid dough.[30] As the concentration of steam increases between dough layers, the increased pressure causes the dough to lift. During the entire baking process, only half of the water vapor contributes to dough lift, as the other half is lost through micropores and capillaries of interconnected dough layers. The effect of gluten proteins during cooling and storage is still unclear. It is possible that gluten proteins influence croissant firming through the loss of plasticizing water, which increases the stiffness of the gluten network.[43] Starch plays a major role in the degradation of croissants during storage. Amylopectin retrogradation occurs over several days to weeks, as amorphous amylopectin chains are realigned into a more crystalline structure.[30] The transformation of the starch causes undesirable firmness in the croissant. Additionally, the formation of the crystal structure of amylopectin requires the incorporation of water. Starch retrogradation actively draws water from the amorphous gluten network and some of the amorphous starch fraction, which reduces the plasticity of both.[30] Water migration influences the quality of stored croissants through two mechanisms. First, as previously stated, water redistributes from gluten to starch as a result of starch retrogradation. Secondly, during the baking process, a moisture gradient was introduced as a result of heat transfer from the oven to the croissant.[30] In fresh croissants, there is high moisture content on the inside and low moisture content on the outside. During storage, this moisture gradient induces water migration from the inside to the outer crust. On a molecular level, water is lost from the amorphous starch fraction and gluten network. At the same time, water diffuses from the outer crust to the environment, which has less moisture.[44] The result of this redistribution of water is a firming up of the croissant, caused by a decrease in starch plasticity and an increase in gluten network rigidity. Due to the presence of large pores in croissants, moisture is lost to the environment at a faster rate than bread products.[45] As such, croissants generally become harder in texture at a faster rate than breads. Fat also affects the quality of croissants in storage. On one hand, an increased amount of in-dough fat has been found to correspond to a reduction in crumb hardness immediately after baking.[30] This is likely attributed to the high-fat content of croissants, as increased fat levels decrease moisture diffusion.[45] On the other hand, although roll-in fat softens the croissant\u2019s initial crumb, its effect on croissant hardness during storage is still unclear.

The term burrito was regional, specifically from Guanajuato, Guerrero, Michoac\u00e1n, San Luis Potos\u00ed and Sinaloa, for what is known as a taco in Mexico City and surrounding areas, and codzito in Yucat\u00e1n and Quintana Roo.[2][3][4] Due to the cultural influence of Mexico City, the term taco became the default, and the meaning of terms like burrito and codzito were forgotten, leading many people to create new meanings and folk histories. In modern times, it is considered by many as a different dish in Mexican[5] and Tex-Mex cuisine[6] that took form in Ciudad Ju\u00e1rez, consisting of a flour tortilla wrapped into a sealed cylindrical shape around various ingredients.[7] In Central and Southern Mexico, burritos are still considered tacos, and are known as \u201ctacos de harina\u201d (wheat flour tacos). [4] The tortilla is sometimes lightly grilled or steamed to soften it, make it more pliable, and allow it to adhere to itself. Burritos are often eaten by hand, as their tight wrapping keeps the ingredients together. Burritos can also be served \"wet\", i.e., covered in a savory and spicy sauce, when they would be eaten with a fork and knife. Burritos are filled with savory ingredients, most often a meat such as beef, chicken, or pork, and often include other ingredients, such as rice, cooked beans (either whole or refried), vegetables, such as lettuce and tomatoes, cheese, and condiments such as salsa, pico de gallo, guacamole, or crema. Burritos are often contrasted in present times with similar dishes such as tacos, in which a small hand-sized tortilla is folded in half around the ingredients rather than wrapped and sealed, or with enchiladas, which use corn masa tortillas and are covered in a savory sauce to be eaten with a fork and knife. The word burrito means \"little donkey\" in Spanish, the diminutive form of burro, or \"donkey\". The name burrito, as applied to the dish, possibly derives from the tendency for burritos to contain a lot of different things similar to how a donkey would be able to carry a large burden.[8] Before the development of the modern burrito, the Maya civilization of Mexico used corn tortillas as early as 1500 B.C. to wrap foods, with fillings of chili peppers, tomatoes, mushrooms, squash, and avocados.[9] Historically, the Pueblo peoples of the Southwestern US also made tortillas filled with beans and meat sauce and prepared much like the modern burrito.[10] But these preparations could also be said to be the origin of the simpler taco, rather than the modern burrito. The precise origin of the modern burrito is not known, but there is evidence that in Mexico burrito was just another name, among others, for a taco, a rolled tortilla, whether corn or wheat, filled with meat or other ingredients. In the 1895 Diccionario de Mejicanismos by Feliz Ramos i Duarte, burrito was identified as the regional name given in the Mexican state of Guanajuato to what is known as a taco in other regions:[11][12] Tortilla arrollada, con carne u otra cosa dentro, que en Yucat\u00e1n llaman co\u00e7ito, y en Cuernavaca y en Mexico, taco.\n(A rolled tortilla with meat or other ingredients inside, called 'co\u00e7ito' in Yucat\u00e1n and 'taco' in the city of Cuernavaca and in Mexico City.) In his \u2014Diccionario de Mejicanismos (1959)\u2014 Mexican linguist and philologist, Francisco J. Santamar\u00eda, identifies burrito as another name for a taco in the state of Guerrero, while in the State of Sinaloa it\u2019s specifically a taco filled with salt:[3] En el Estado de Guerrero, taco, en el sentido de tortilla arrollada con comida adentro. En Yucatan le llaman coorto. En Sinaloa, taco de tortilla con sal.\n(In the State of Guerrero, taco, in the sense of a rolled tortilla with food inside. In Yucatan they call it coorto. In Sinaloa, a tortilla taco with salt.) The Dictionary of Mexican Spanish (Diccionario del Espa\u00f1ol de M\u00e9xico) by the Colegio de M\u00e9xico also provides those definitions, stating that it\u2019s a regionalism from, both, the states of Guerrero and Michoac\u00e1n for tacos; and also states that, in the state of Sinaloa, it\u2019s a \"taco de sal\" (salt taco), a rolled corn tortilla with salt in it.[4] In her book \u2014Life in Mexico (1843)\u2014 Scottish noblewoman Frances Erskine Inglis states that in Michoac\u00e1n the term \u2018burro\u2019 was the name given to a corn tortilla filled with cheese:[13] ...\u00a0the gentlemen from Morelia, suffering for their politeness in having escorted us, the two damsels of the bath, naiads of the boiling spring, pitying our hungry condition, came to offer their services; one asked me if I should like \"to eat a burro in the mean time\"? A burro being an ass, I was rather startled at the proposition, and assured her that I should infinitely prefer waiting a little longer before resorting to so desperate a measure. \"Some people call them pecadoras\", (female sinners!) said her sister. Upon this, the gentlemen came to our assistance, and burros or pecadoras were ordered forthwith. They proved to be hot tortillas, with cheese in them, and we found them particularly good. Being that \u2018burrito\u2019 was, originally, just a regional name for what is known as a \u2018taco\u2019 or \u2018codzito\u2018 in other regions of Mexico, the use of both, corn and wheat flour tortillas was understandable. In fact, references to burritos made with corn tortillas appear as late as 1938 in California. Ana B\u00e9gu\u00e9 de Packman, author of the book \u2014Early California Hospitality (1938)\u2014 wrote that corn and flour tortillas could be used interchangeably for making burritos.[14] In modern day Mexico, wheat flour tortilla burritos are known as \"tacos de harina\" (wheat flour tacos) in Central and Southern Mexico.[4]  Stemming from the belief that burritos are distinct from tacos, there are many myths and folk stories about the origin of burritos, most of them originating in the United States. An often repeated piece of folk history is the story of a man named Juan M\u00e9ndez who sold tacos at a street stand in the Bella Vista neighborhood of Ciudad Ju\u00e1rez during the Mexican Revolution period (1910\u20131921), while using a donkey as a transport for himself and his food.[15] To keep the food warm, M\u00e9ndez wrapped it in large homemade flour tortillas underneath a small tablecloth. As the \"food of the burrito\" (i.e., \"food of the little donkey\") grew in popularity, \"burrito\" was eventually adopted as the name for these large tacos.[9] Some have speculated that it may have originated with vaqueros, the cowboys of northern Mexico in the 19th century.[9][11] In 1923, Alejandro Borquez opened the Sonora Cafe in Los Angeles that later changed its name to El Cholo Spanish Cafe.[16] Burritos first appeared on American restaurant menus at the El Cholo Spanish Cafe in Los Angeles during the 1930s.[17] Burritos were mentioned in the U.S. media for the first time in 1934,[18] appearing in the Mexican Cookbook, a collection of regional recipes from New Mexico that was written by historian Erna Fergusson.[19] In 1956, a frozen burrito was developed in Southern California.[20][21]:\u200a192 Burritos are a traditional food of Ciudad Ju\u00e1rez, a city bordering El Paso, Texas, in the northern Mexican state of Chihuahua, where people buy them at restaurants and roadside stands. Northern Mexican border towns like Villa Ahumada have an established reputation for serving burritos. Authentic Mexican burritos are usually small and thin, with flour tortillas containing only one or two of several ingredients: either some form of meat or fish, potato, rice, beans, asadero cheese, chile rajas, or chile relleno.[22] Other ingredients may include: barbacoa, mole, refried beans and cheese (a \"bean and cheese\" burrito), or deshebrada (shredded slow-cooked flank steak). The deshebrada burrito has a variation with chile colorado (mild to moderately hot) and one with salsa verde (very hot). The Mexican burrito may be a northern variation of the traditional taco de Canasta, which is eaten for breakfast, lunch, and dinner.[23] Although burritos are one of the most popular examples of Mexican cuisine outside of Mexico, they are only popular in the northern part of Mexico. However, they are beginning to appear in some nontraditional venues in other parts of Mexico. Wheat flour tortillas (used in burritos) are now often seen throughout much of Mexico (possibly due to these areas being less than optimal for growing maize or corn), despite at one time being particular to northwestern Mexico, the Southwestern US Mexican-American community, and Pueblo Indian tribes. Burritos are commonly called tacos de harina (\"wheat flour tacos\") in Central Mexico and Southern Mexico, and burritas (the feminine variation with 'a') in \"northern-style\" restaurants outside of northern Mexico proper. A long and thin fried burrito called a chivichanga, which is similar to a chimichanga, is prepared in the state of Sonora and vicinity.[24] A variation of the burrito found in the Mexican state of Sonora is known as the burro percher\u00f3n.[citation needed] The origins of the Mission burrito or Mission-style burrito can be traced back to San Francisco, in the Mission District taquer\u00edas of the 1960s and 1970s. This type of burrito is produced on a steam table assembly line, and is characterized by a large stuffed flour tortilla wrapped in aluminum foil, and may include fillings such as carne asada (beef), Mexican-style rice, whole beans (not refritos), sour cream and onion. Febronio Ontiveros claims to have offered the first retail burrito in San Francisco in 1961 at El Faro (\"The Lighthouse\"), a corner grocery store on Folsom Street. Ontiveros claims credit for inventing the \"super burrito\", a style which may have led to the early development of the \"San Francisco style\". This innovative style involves the addition of rice, sour cream and guacamole to the standard burrito of meat, beans, and cheese.[25][26] The Mission burrito emerged as a regional culinary movement during the 1970s and 1980s. The popularity of San Francisco-style burritos has grown locally at Mission Street taquerias like El Farolito, and nationally at chains like Chipotle Mexican Grill,[27] Illegal Pete's, Chevy's Fresh Mex, Freebirds World Burrito, Qdoba, and Barberitos. Chili's had a brief stint with \"Fresh Mex\" foods and burritos between 2015 and 2017.[28] In 1995, World Wrapps opened in San Francisco's Marina District and brought a burrito-inspired wrap style to the restaurant industry.[29] San Diego\u2013style burritos include \"California burritos\" and carne asada burritos. The style has been described by food writers as an \"austere meal of meat, cheese and salsa\", a contrast to the Mission-style burrito, which is typically larger and always contains more ingredients.[30] A significant subgroup of Mexican restaurants in San Diego serves burritos described as \"no-frills\" and, in contrast to Mission-style burritos, the assembly line is not used.[21]:\u200a165\u200a[31] In the early 1960s, Roberto Robledo opened a tortilleria in San Diego and learned the restaurant business. Robledo began selling small bean burritos (or burrititos) at La Lomita in the late 1960s, and by 1970, he had established the first Roberto's Taco Shop. By 1999, Roberto's restaurants had expanded to a chain of 60 taco shops offering fresh burritos known for their distinctive quality. Hoping to draw on the prestige of Roberto's, new taco shops in San Diego began using the \"-bertos\" suffix, with names like Alberto's, Filiberto's, Hilberto's, and others.[21]:\u200a166\u2013169\u200a[32] The California burrito originated at an unknown -berto's named restaurant in San Diego in the 1980s.[21]:\u200a165,\u200a168\u200a The Fresh MXN chain (formerly Santana's) also claimed to be the originator of the California burrito.[33] The earliest-known published mention was in a 1995 article in the Albuquerque Tribune.[34] The California burrito[35] typically consists of chunks of carne asada meat, French fries, cheese, and either cilantro, pico de gallo, sour cream, onion, or guacamole (or some combination of these five).[21]:\u200a153\u200a[36][37][38] The ingredients are similar to those used in the \"carne asada fries\" dish, and it is considered a staple of the local cuisine of San Diego.[39][40] With the merging of French fries and more traditional burrito fillings, the California burrito is an example of fusion border food.[31][40][41] The California burrito has also been described as a \"trans-class\" food item, as it is regularly consumed by people across socioeconomic lines.[42] Variants of this burrito may add shrimp (surf and turf),[43] or substitute carnitas (pork)[44] or chicken[40] for carne asada. The carne asada burrito is considered one of the regional foods of San Diego.[45] Carolynn Carreno has said that to San Diegans, \"carne asada burritos are as integral to the experience of the place as a slice of (pizza) pie is to a New Yorker.\"[46] The San Diego\u2013style carne asada burrito is served with chunks of carne asada, guacamole, and pico de gallo salsa.[47][48] This \"wall-to-wall\" use of meat contrasts to burrito styles that use rice and beans as filler ingredients.[49] Los Angeles also has several unique local burrito varieties. The first is the most traditional and is exemplified by the versions at Mexican-American restaurants such as Al & Bea's, Lupe's #2, and Burrito King.[50][51] These restaurants have often been in existence for decades, and they offer a distinctly Americanized menu compared with the typical taqueria. The burrito of L.A. itself can take multiple forms, but is almost always dominated by some combination of: refried beans, meat (often stewed beef or chili), and cheese (usually cheddar), with rice and other ingredients typical of Mission burritos offered as add-ons, if at all.[52] The most basic version of this burrito consists of only beans and cheese; beyond this, there are the \"green chile\" and \"red chile\" burritos, which may simply mean the addition of chiles or a meatless chile sauce to the plain beans (as at Al & Bea's), meat or cheese as well.[53] Rice, again, is rarely included, which, along with the choice of chiles, is one of the style's most defining traits.[51] The menu will then usually go on to list multiple other combinations, such as beef and bean, all-beef, a \"special\" with further ingredients, etc. If the restaurant also offers hamburgers and sandwiches, it may sell a burrito version of these, such as a \"hot dog burrito\".[54] In addition to the version described, Los Angeles is also home to three burrito styles that can be said to fall under the category of Mexican fusion cuisine.[55] The first is the famed \"kosher burrito,\" served since 1946 at its eponymous restaurant at 1st Street and Main in Downtown Los Angeles.[56] Another is the Korean kogi burrito, invented by American chef Roy Choi, the first to combine Mexican and Korean cuisines.[57][58] The kogi burrito was named the seventh best burrito in Los Angeles in 2012 by the LA Weekly.[57] The kogi burrito is accented with chile-soy vinaigrette, sesame oil, and fresh lime juice. Food writer Cathy Chaplin has said that \"this is what Los Angeles tastes like.\"[59] Finally, there is the sushi burrito, most notably the version sold at the Jogasaki food truck.[60] Wrapped in flour tortillas, sushi burritos include such fillings as spicy tuna, tempura, and cucumber.[59] The existence of such a large truly Mexican community in Los Angeles also makes it possible to find a variety of authentic burrito dishes from different regions of Mexico: from Oaxaca to Hidalgo.[57]   Taco Bell research chef Anne Albertine experimented with grilling burritos to enhance portability. This grilling technique allowed large burritos to remain sealed without spilling their contents.[68] This is a well-known cooking technique used by some San Francisco taquerias and Northern Mexican burrito stands. Traditionally, grilled burritos are cooked on a comal (griddle). Bean burritos, which are high in protein and low in saturated fat, have been touted for their health benefits.[69] Black bean burritos are also a good source of dietary fiber and phytochemicals.[70]           Hot or room temperature", "Tempura": "Tempura (\u5929\u3077\u3089 or \u5929\u9ea9\u7f85, tenpura, [temp\u026f\u027ea]) is a typical Japanese dish that usually consists of seafood and vegetables that have been coated in a thin batter and deep fried. Tempura has its origins dating back to the 16th century, when Portuguese Jesuits brought the Western-style cooking method of coating foods with flour and frying, via Nanban trade.[1] A light batter is made of iced water, eggs,[2] and soft wheat flour (cake,[3] pastry[4] or all-purpose flour[2]). Sometimes baking soda[5] or baking powder is added to make the fritter light.[5] Using sparkling water in place of plain water[6] has a similar effect. Tempura batter is traditionally mixed in small batches using chopsticks for only a few seconds, leaving lumps in the mixture that, along with the cold batter temperature, result in a unique fluffy and crisp tempura structure when cooked. The batter is often kept cold by adding ice or placing the bowl inside a larger bowl with ice. Overmixing the batter will activate wheat gluten, which causes the flour mixture to become soft and dough-like when fried. Specially formulated tempura flour is available in supermarkets. This is generally light (low-gluten) flour and occasionally contains leaveners such as baking powder.[7] Tempura does not use breadcrumbs (panko) in the coating.[8] Deep-fried foods that are coated with breadcrumbs are called furai,[9] Japanese-invented Western-style deep-fried foods, such as tonkatsu or ebi furai (fried prawn).[9] No seasonings or salt are added to the batter, or the ingredients,[2] except for some recipes recommending rinsing seafood in salt water before preparation.[10] Thin slices or strips of vegetables or seafood are dipped in the batter, then briefly deep-fried in hot oil.[2] Vegetable oil[11] or canola oil are most common; however, tempura was traditionally cooked using sesame oil.[12] Many specialty shops still use sesame oil or tea seed oil, and it is thought certain compounds in these oils help to produce light, crispier batter.[citation needed] The finished fry is pale whiteish, thin and fluffy,[13] yet crunchy.[14] The bits of batter (known as tenkasu) are scooped out between batches of tempura so they do not burn and leave a bad flavor in the oil.[2] A small mesh scoop (Ami jakushi) is used for this purpose. Tenkasu are often reserved as ingredients in other dishes or as a topping. Various seafood and vegetables are commonly used as the ingredients in traditional tempura. The most popular seafood tempura is probably ebi (shrimp) tempura. Types of seafood used in tempura include: Vegetables tempura is called yasai tempura. The all-vegetable tempura might be served as a vegetarian dish. Types of vegetables include: Cooked pieces of tempura are either eaten with dipping sauce, salted without sauce, or used to assemble other dishes. Tempura is commonly served with grated daikon and eaten hot immediately after frying. In Japan, it is often found in bowls of soba or udon soup in the form of shrimp, shiso leaf, or fritter.  The most common sauce is tentsuyu sauce (roughly three parts dashi, one part mirin, and one part sh\u014dyu). Alternatively, skim tempura may be sprinkled with sea salt before eating. Mixtures of powdered green tea and salt or yuzu and salt are also used.[16]\nKakiage is a type of tempura made with mixed vegetable strips, such as onion, carrot, and burdock, and sometimes including shrimp or squid, which are deep fried as small round fritters. Tempura is also used in combination with other foods. When served over soba (buckwheat noodles), it is called tempura soba[17] or tensoba. Tempura is also served as a donburi dish where tempura shrimp and vegetables are served over steamed rice in a bowl (tendon) and on top of udon soup (tempura udon). Earlier Japanese deep-fried food was either simply fried without breading or batter or fried with rice flour.[citation needed]  However, toward the end of the 16th century, the technique of fritter-cooking with a batter of flour and eggs was acquired in Nagasaki by Portuguese missionaries.[19] Peixinhos da horta was a dish often eaten during Lent or Ember days, to fulfill the fasting and abstinence rules for Catholics. The word \"tempura\" originates from the Latin word tempora, a term referring to these fasting times[20] (Spanish: T\u00e9mporas).[21] In those days, the ingredients were covered in thick batter containing flour, sugar and sake, and then fried in lard. As the batter already contained seasoning, it was eaten without dipping sauce.[22] In the early 17th century, around the Tokyo Bay area, tempura ingredients and preparation underwent a remarkable change as the yatai (food cart) culture gained popularity. Making the best use of fresh seafood while preserving its delicate taste, tempura used only flour, eggs, and water as ingredients, and the batter was not flavored.  As the batter was mixed minimally in cold water, it avoided the dough-like stickiness caused by the activation of wheat gluten, resulting in the crispy texture, which is now characteristic of tempura. It became customary to dip tempura quickly in a sauce mixed with grated daikon just before eating it. Today in Japan, the mainstream of tempura recipes originate from \"Tokyo style\" (also known as Edo style) tempura, invented at the food stalls along the riverside fish market in the Edo period.  The main reason tempura became popular was the abundance of seafood. In addition, as oil extraction techniques advanced, cooking oil became cheaper. Serving deep-fried food indoors was prohibited during Edo because tempura oil was a fire hazard in Japanese buildings, which were made of paper and wood. Therefore, tempura gained popularity as fast food eaten at outdoor food stalls. It was skewered and eaten with a dipping sauce.  Tempura is considered one of \"the Edo Delicacies\" along with soba (buckwheat noodles) and sushi, which were also food stall take-outs. The modern tempura recipe was first published in 1671 in the cookbook called \"\u6599\u7406\u732e\u7acb\u6284\". After the Meiji period, tempura was no longer considered a fast food item but developed as a high-class cuisine. The word \"tempura\", or the technique of dipping fish and vegetables into a batter and frying them, comes from the word tempora, a Latin word meaning \"times\", \"time period\" used by both Spanish and Portuguese missionaries to refer to the Lenten period or Ember Days (ad tempora quadragesima), Fridays, and other Christian holy days. Ember Days, or quatuor anni tempora in Latin, refer to holy days when Catholics avoid meat and eat fish or vegetables instead.[23][24] The idea that the word \"tempura\" may have been derived from the Portuguese noun tempero, meaning a condiment or seasoning of any kind, or from the verb temperar, meaning \"to season\" is also possible as the Japanese language could easily have assumed the word tempero as is, without changing any vowels as the Portuguese pronunciation, in this case, is similar to the Japanese.[25] There is still today a dish in Portugal very similar to tempura called peixinhos da horta, \"garden fishes\", which consists of green beans dipped in a batter and fried. The term \"tempura\" is thought to have gained popularity in southern Japan; it became widely used to refer to any food prepared using hot oil, including some already existing Japanese foods.[citation needed] Today, particularly in western Japan, the word \"tempura\" is also commonly used to refer to satsuma-age, fried surimi fish cake which is made without batter.[26][27] In Japan, restaurants specializing in tempura are called tenpura-ya. Many restaurants offer tempura as part of a set meal or a bento (lunch box), and it is also a popular ingredient in take-out or convenience store bento boxes.  The ingredients and styles of cooking and serving tempura vary greatly throughout the country, with importance placed on using fresh, seasonal ingredients. Outside Japan (as well as recently in Japan), there are many nontraditional and fusion uses of tempura. Chefs all over the world include tempura dishes on their menus, and a wide variety of different batters and ingredients are used, including nontraditional broccoli, zucchini, asparagus and chuchu. More unusual ingredients may include nori slices, dry fruit such as bananas, and ice cream (tempura-based fried ice cream). American restaurants are known to serve tempura in the form of various types of meat, particularly chicken and cheeses, usually mozzarella.[citation needed] A variation is to use panko (breadcrumbs), which results in a crisper consistency than tempura batter, although in Japan this would be classified as a furai dish. Tempura (particularly shrimp) is often used as a filling in makizushi. A more recent variation of tempura sushi has entire pieces of sushi dipped in batter and tempura-fried. In Bangladesh, the blossoms of pumpkins or marrows are often deep-fried with a gram of rice flour spice mix, creating a Bengali-style tempura known as kumro ful bhaja. In Taiwan, tempura, as described in the preceding, is known as ti\u0101nf\u00f9lu\u00f3 (\u5929\u5a66\u7f85) and can commonly be found on the menu in Japanese restaurants all over the island. A similar-sounding dish, tianbula (Chinese: \u751c\u4e0d\u8fa3; pinyin: ti\u00e1nb\u00f9l\u00e0; lit. 'sweet', 'not spicy') is usually sold at night markets. Tianbula is Japanese satsuma-age and was introduced to Taiwan under Japanese rule by people from Kyushu, where satsuma-age is commonly known as tempura.[28][26][27]", "Goulash": " Goulash (Hungarian: guly\u00e1s) is a soup or stew of meat and vegetables seasoned with paprika[1] and other spices.[2] Originating in Hungary, goulash is a common meal predominantly eaten in Central Europe but also in other parts of Europe. It is one of the national dishes of Hungary and a symbol of the country.[3][4][5] Its origins may be traced back as far as the 10th century to stews eaten by Hungarian shepherds.[6] At that time, the cooked and flavored meat was dried with the help of the sun and packed into bags produced from sheep's stomachs, needing only water to make it into a meal.[6] Earlier versions of goulash did not include paprika, as it was not introduced to Europe until the 16th century. The name originates from the Hungarian guly\u00e1s [\u02c8\u0261uja\u02d0\u0283] \u24d8. The word gulya means 'herd of cattle' in Hungarian, and guly\u00e1s means 'herdsman' or 'cowboy'.[7][8] The word guly\u00e1s originally meant only 'herdsman', but over time the dish became guly\u00e1sh\u00fas ('goulash meat') \u2013 that is to say, a meat dish which was prepared by herdsmen. In medieval times, the Hungarian herdsman of Central Europe made use of every possible part of the animal, as was common practice. As meat was scarce, nearly all of the animal was often used to make the soup. Today, guly\u00e1s refers both to the herdsmen, and to the soup or stew. From the Middle Ages until well into the 19th century, the Puszta was the home of enormous herds of cattle. They were driven, in their tens of thousands, to Europe's biggest cattle markets in Moravia, Vienna, Nuremberg and Venice. The herdsmen made sure that there were always some cattle that had to be slaughtered along the way, the flesh of which provided them with guly\u00e1sh\u00fas.[9][10] In Hungarian cuisine, traditional bogr\u00e1csguly\u00e1s,[11] p\u00f6rk\u00f6lt, and paprik\u00e1s were thick stews made by cattle herders and stockmen.[11] If there was more water available, they could make soup  (Guly\u00e1sleves). In present-day Hungary, Gulyas can be made as a soup (Guly\u00e1sleves) or, perhaps less commonly,  as a stew (bogr\u00e1csguly\u00e1s[12]). The basic ingredients include onions, peppers, tomatoes, meat, paprika, caraway seeds, potatoes, and homemade noodles (csipetke). Wine, carrots, and other ingredients are optional and reflect regional and family variations. Except for paprik\u00e1s, Hungarian stews do not rely on flour or roux for thickening.\nTomato is a modern addition, totally unknown in the original recipe and in the whole Central European food culture until the first half of the 20th century.[citation needed] Goulash can be prepared from beef, veal,[13] pork, or lamb.  Typical cuts include the shank, shin, or shoulder; as a result, goulash derives its thickness from tough, well-exercised muscles rich in collagen, which is converted to gelatin during the cooking process. Meat is cut into chunks, seasoned with salt, and then browned with sliced onion in a pot with oil or lard. Paprika is added, along with water or stock, and the goulash is left to simmer. After cooking a while, garlic, whole or ground caraway seed, or soup vegetables like carrot, parsley root, green and/or red bell pepper and celery may be added. Other herbs and spices could also be added, especially cayenne, bay leaf and thyme.[11] Diced potatoes may be added, since they provide starch as they cook, which makes the goulash thicker and smoother. However, red peppers and potatoes are post-16th century additions, unknown in the original recipe. A small amount of white wine or wine vinegar may also be added near the end of cooking to round the taste. Goulash may be served with small egg noodles called csipetke. The name Csipetke comes from pinching small, fingernail-sized bits out of the dough (csipet being Hungarian for 'pinch') before adding them to the boiling soup. The Hungarian cook Karoly Gundel maintains that in a goulash recipe, meat should not be mixed with any grains or with potatoes.[14] However this is later contradicted by George Lang[15] and other Hungarian chefs, including Gundel himself who, in his 1935 publication, \"Hungarian Cookery Book\", includes potatoes in his recipe for \"GULY\u00c1S SOUP (GOULASH)\". Interestingly, he also includes an entry for \"GULY\u00c1S (GOULASH) \" as a stew that \"should be made the same way as Guly\u00e1s Soup (see recipe No. 1) but with less water\".[16] Hungarian goulash variations include:[17] A thicker and richer goulash, similar to a stew, originally made with three kinds of meat, is called Sz\u00e9kely guly\u00e1s, named after the Hungarian writer, journalist and archivist J\u00f3zsef Sz\u00e9kely (1825\u20131895).[11] \"Paprik\u00e1s krumpli\" is a traditional paprika-based potato stew with diced potatoes, onion, ground paprika, and some bacon or sliced spicy sausage, like the smoked Debrecener, in lieu of beef. In German-speaking countries, this inexpensive peasant stew is made with sausage and known as Kartoffelgulasch (\"potato goulash\"). Bell pepper is sometimes added. Thick stews similar to p\u00f6rk\u00f6lt and the original cattlemen stew are popular throughout almost all the former Austrian-Hungarian Empire, from Northeast Italy to the Carpathians. Like p\u00f6rk\u00f6lt, these stews are generally served with boiled or mashed potato, polenta, dumplings (e.g. nokedli, or galuska), sp\u00e4tzle or, alternatively, as a stand-alone dish with bread. Romani people have their own version of goulash.[19] Goulash (Albanian: gullash) is considered a traditional dish among some Northern Albanians.[20] In Vienna, the former center of the Austro-Hungarian Empire, a special kind of goulash has developed. The Wiener Saftgulasch or the Fiakergulasch (Fiacre being a horse-drawn cab) on the menu in traditional restaurants is a rich p\u00f6rk\u00f6lt-like stew; more onions but no tomatoes or other vegetables are used, and it usually comes just with dark bread. A variation of the Wiener Saftgulasch is the Fiakergulasch, which is served with fried egg, fried sausage, and dumplings named Semmelkn\u00f6del. Goulash (Croatian: gula\u0161) is also very popular in most parts of Croatia, especially north (Hrvatsko Zagorje) and Lika. In Gorski Kotar and Lika, venison or wild boar frequently replace beef (lova\u010dki gula\u0161). There is also a kind of goulash with porcini mushrooms (gula\u0161 od vrganja). Bacon is an important ingredient. Gula\u0161 is often served with fu\u017ei, njoki, polenta or pasta. It is augmented with vegetables. Green and red bell peppers and carrots are most commonly used. Sometimes one or more other kinds of meat are added, e.g., pork loin, bacon, or mutton. In the Czech Republic and Slovakia, goulash (Czech and Slovak: gul\u00e1\u0161) is usually made with beef, although pork varieties exist, and served with boiled or steamed bread dumplings (goulash with beef in Czech hov\u011bz\u00ed gul\u00e1\u0161 s knedl\u00edkem, in Slovak hov\u00e4dz\u00ed gul\u00e1\u0161 s kned\u013eou), in Slovakia more typically with bread. In pubs it is often garnished with slices of fresh onion, and is typically accompanied by beer. Beer can be also added to the stew in the process of cooking. Seasonal varieties of goulash include venison or wild boar goulashes. Another popular variant of gul\u00e1\u0161 is seged\u00ednsk\u00fd gul\u00e1\u0161 (Sz\u00e9kelyguly\u00e1s), with sauerkraut. In Czech and Slovak slang, the word gul\u00e1\u0161 means \"mishmash\", typically used as m\u00edt v tom gul\u00e1\u0161: to be disoriented or to lack understanding of something. Fish goulash (Amharic: \u12a0\u1223 \u1309\u120b\u123d; asa gula\u0161) is a popular dish in Ethiopia, particularly during the numerous fasting seasons as required by the Ethiopian Orthodox Church.[21] It is usually prepared with a spicy sauce having a tomato and onion base and served with injera or rice.[22] German Gulasch is either a beef (Rindergulasch), pork (Schweinegulasch), venison (Hirschgulasch), or wild boar (Wildschweingulasch)[23] stew that may include red wine and is usually served with potatoes (in the north), white rice or spirelli noodles (mostly in canteens), and dumplings (in the south). Gulaschsuppe (goulash soup) is the same concept served as a soup, usually with pieces of white bread. Goulash in Italy is eaten in the autonomous regions of Friuli-Venezia Giulia and Trentino-Alto Adige/S\u00fcdtirol, that once had been part of the Austro-Hungarian Empire. It is eaten as a regular Sunday dish.[citation needed] It can also, although less typically so, be found in the nearby Veneto. An interesting regional recipe comes from the Pustertal (Val Pusteria, Puster Valley) in South Tyrol. It is made of beef and red wine, and seasoned with rosemary, red paprika, bay leaf, marjoram and lemon zest, served with crusty white bread or polenta. Goulash is also quite popular in the city of Ancona, which is culturally quite near to eastern Europe. In the Netherlands, goulash is usually prepared with beef. It is typically consumed as a stew, and is thus closer to p\u00f6rk\u00f6lt. In Poland, goulash (Polish: gulasz) is eaten in most parts of the country. A variant dish exists that is similar to Hungarian p\u00f6rk\u00f6lt. It came to being around the 9th century. It is usually served with mashed potatoes or various forms of noodles and dumplings, such as pyzy. In Serbia, goulash (Serbian: \u0433\u0443\u043b\u0430\u0448) is eaten in most parts of the country, especially in Vojvodina, where it was probably introduced by the province's Hungarian population. [citation needed] It is actually a p\u00f6rk\u00f6lt-like stew, usually made with beef, veal or pork, but also with game meat like venison and boar. Compulsory ingredients are meat and onions, usually in 50-50% ratio, paprika, and lard or oil, other ingredients being optional: garlic, parsley, chili pepper, black pepper, cinnamon, bell peppers, carrots, tomatoes, red wine, mushrooms, bacon. Sometimes, goulash is sweetened by adding tomato paste, sugar or dark chocolate at the very end. In Serbia, goulash is most often served with macaroni or potato mash.[citation needed] In Slovene partizanski gola\u017e, \"partisan goulash\", favored by Slovenian partisans during the Second World War, is still regularly served at mass public events. \"Partisan gola\u017e\" uses onion in equal proportion to meat; two or more types of meat are usually used in preparing this dish. The most widespread form of gola\u017e in home cooking is a thick beef stew that is most commonly served with mashed potatoes. As elsewhere in the wider region, Szeged goulash, usually referred to as segedin, is also a popular dish for home preparation. North American goulash, mentioned in cookbooks since at least 1914, exists in a number of variant recipes.[24][25] Originally a dish of seasoned beef,[25] core ingredients of American goulash now usually include elbow macaroni, cubed steak, ground beef or \"hamburger\", and tomatoes in some form, whether canned whole, as tomato sauce, tomato soup, and/or tomato paste. As a descendant, of sorts, of Hungarian goulash, it probably originated as a variation of the Hungarian bogr\u00e1csguly\u00e1s which mixes all the ingredients together in the end. This mixture of ingredients has probably led to many adulterated variations where any mixture of meat and paprika is often mistakenly called goulash.[24] In English, the word \u201cgoulash\u201d has an alternative meaning of \"a mixture of heterogeneous elements or hodgepodge or jumble\".[26] hot", "Shepherd's Pie": " Shepherd's pie, cottage pie, or in French cuisine hachis Parmentier, is a savoury dish of cooked minced meat topped with mashed potato and baked, also called Sanders or Saunders. The meat used may be either previously cooked or freshly minced. The usual meats are beef or lamb. The terms shepherd's pie and cottage pie have been used interchangeably since they came into use in the late 18th and early 19th centuries, although some writers insist that a shepherd's pie should contain lamb or mutton, and a cottage pie, beef. The term was in use by 1791. Parson Woodforde mentions \"Cottage-Pye\" in his diary entry for 29 August 1791 and several times thereafter. He records that the meat was veal but does not say what the topping was.[1] The dish was known in its present form, though not under the same name, in the early 19th century: in 1806 Maria Rundell published a recipe for \"Sanders\", consisting of the same ingredients as cottage or shepherd's pie: minced beef or mutton, with onion and gravy, topped with mashed potato and baked as individual servings.[2][n 1] Sanders or Saunders could also have a filling of sliced meat.[4] The name \"Saunders\" is still used in some cookery books.[5] In 20th-century and later use the term cottage pie has widely, but not exclusively, been used for a dish of chopped or minced beef with a mashed potato topping.[6][n 2] The beef may be fresh or previously cooked;[6] the latter was at one time more usual. Well into the 20th century the absence of refrigeration made it expedient in many domestic kitchens to store cooked meat rather than raw. In the 1940s the chef Louis Diat recalled of his childhood days, \"when housewives bought their Sunday meat they selected pieces large enough to make into leftover dishes for several days\".[8] Modern recipes for cottage pie typically use fresh beef.[6] A recipe for shepherd's pie published in Edinburgh in 1849 in The Practice of Cookery and Pastry specifies cooked meat of any kind, sliced rather than minced, covered with mashed potato and baked.[9] In the 1850s the term was also used for a Scottish dish that contained a mutton and diced potato filling inside a pastry crust.[10] Neither shepherd's pie nor cottage pie was mentioned in the original edition of Mrs Beeton's Household Management in 1861.[11] More recently \"shepherd's pie\" has generally been used for a potato-topped dish of minced lamb. According to the Oxford Companion to Food, \"In keeping with the name, the meat should be mutton or lamb; and it is usually cooked meat left over from a roast\".[6] As with beef, it was commonplace in the days before refrigeration to cook a Sunday joint to last in various guises throughout the week. Dorothy Hartley quotes a traditional verse, \"Vicarage mutton\", showing not only the uses to which the joint was put, but also the interchangeability of the terms \"shepherd's\" and \"cottage\" pie: Hot on Sunday,\nCold on Monday,\nHashed on Tuesday,\nMinced on Wednesday,\nCurried Thursday,\nBroth on Friday,\nCottage pie Saturday.[12] The dish Hachis Parmentier is named after Antoine-Augustin Parmentier, who popularised the potato in French cuisine in the late 18th century.[6]  It is documented from the late 19th century.[n 3] It is usually made with chopped or minced lamb or beef; in either case it may be made with either fresh or left-over cooked meat. (The modern English term \"hash\" derives from the French hachis, meaning food \"finely chopped\".)[14][n 4] In some recipes a layer of saut\u00e9 potatoes is put in the cooking dish before the meat filling and mashed potato topping are added.[16] A more elaborate version by Auguste Escoffier, named Hachis de boeuf \u00e0 Parmentier, consists of baked potatoes, the contents of which are removed, mixed with freshly-cooked diced beef, returned to the potato shells and covered with sauce lyonnaise.[17] There are no universally agreed ingredients for any of the three dishes. The 24 recipes cited in the table show the varieties of titles and ingredients recommended by cooks and food writers from Australia, Britain, Canada, France and the US. Fillings for other pies with a mashed potato topping are numerous, and include artichoke hearts and red peppers;[42] black pudding;[43] chicken and spinach;[44] chorizo;[45] curried chicken;[46] duck;[47] rabbit;[48] salmon;[49] salt cod;[50] turkey and ham;[51] and flaked white fish with shrimps, in a white sauce.[52] Other pies with non-pastry toppings include:", "Clam Chowder": " Clam chowder is any of several chowder soups in American cuisine containing clams. In addition to clams, common ingredients include diced potatoes, salt pork, and onions. Other vegetables are not typically used. It is believed that clams were used in chowder because of the relative ease of harvesting them.[3] Clam chowder is usually served with saltine crackers or small, hexagonal oyster crackers. The dish originated in the Northeastern United States, but is now commonly served in restaurants throughout the country. Many regional variations exist, but the three most prevalent are New England or \"white\" clam chowder, which includes milk or cream, Manhattan or \"red\" clam chowder, which includes tomatoes, and Rhode Island or \"clear\" clam chowder, which omits both.[4] Early documentation of \"clam chowder\" as we know it today did not contain milk and was thickened during cooking using crackers or stale bread.[5] The first recipe for Manhattan clam chowder, with tomatoes and no milk, was published before 1919,[6] and the current name was attested in 1934. As recipes for clam chowder spread throughout the United States in the 19th and 20th centuries, many regionally developed variants have arisen. Manhattan clam chowder has a red, tomato-based broth and unlike New England clam chowder there is no milk or cream. Manhattan-style chowder also usually contains other vegetables, such as celery and carrots to create a mirepoix.[7] Thyme is often used as a seasoning. Many sources attribute its creation to Rhode Island's Portuguese fishing communities who were known both for their traditional tomato-based stews and for their frequent travels to New York City's Fulton Fish Market during the mid-1800s.[8] While Rhode Island clam chowder is clear, it was relatively common in Rhode Island for some cooks to add tomato sauce to their chowder. In Rhode Island this style chowder is also frequently referred to as \"Rocky Point Clam Chowder\"[9] as it was a popular menu item at the Rocky Point Amusement Park Shore Dinner Hall since the park opened in 1847.[10] This chowder was at times called by various names including \"Clam Chowder \u2013 Coney Island Style\" (1893).[11] Manhattan clam chowder is included in Victor Hirtzler's Hotel St. Francis Cookbook (1919) and \"The Delmonico Cook Book\" (1890) as \"clam chowder\".[6][12] The \"Manhattan\" name is first attested in a 1934 cookbook.[1] New England clam chowder, occasionally referred to as Boston or Boston-style clam chowder,[13] is a milk- or cream-based chowder, and is often of a thicker consistency than other regional styles. It is commonly made with milk, butter, potatoes, salt pork, onion, and clams.[14] Flour or, historically, crushed hard tack may be added as a thickener. New England clam chowder is usually accompanied by oyster crackers. Crackers may be crushed and mixed into the soup for thickener, or used as a garnish.[15] Rhode Island clam chowder is made with clear broth, and contains no dairy or tomatoes. It is common in southeastern Rhode Island through eastern Connecticut.[7] In Rhode Island, it is sometimes called \"South County Style\" referring to Washington County, where it apparently originated. Long Island clam chowder is part New England\u2013style and part Manhattan-style, making it a pinkish creamy tomato clam chowder. The name is intended as humorous: Long Island is between Manhattan and New England.[16] The two parent chowders are typically cooked separately before being poured in the same bowl. This variant is popular in many small restaurants across Suffolk County, New York.[17] Served throughout North Carolina's Outer Banks region, this variation of clam chowder has clear broth, bacon, potatoes, onions, and flour as a thickening agent. It is usually seasoned with copious amounts of white and/or black pepper, but occasionally with chopped green onions or even hot pepper sauce.[18][19] Minorcan clam chowder is a spicy traditional version found in Florida restaurants near St. Augustine and the northeast corner of the Sunshine State. It has a tomato broth base, with a \"secret ingredient\", Spanish datil pepper, an extremely hot chili comparable to the habanero.[20]", "Miso Soup": "Miso soup (\u5473\u564c\u6c41 or \u304a\u5473\u564c\u6c41, misoshiru or omisoshiru, \u304a-/o- being an \u2018honorific prefix\u2019) is a traditional Japanese soup consisting of a dashi stock into which softened miso paste is mixed. In addition, there are many optional ingredients (various vegetables, tofu, abura-age, etc.) that may be added depending on regional and seasonal recipes, and personal preference. In Japanese food culture, miso soup is a representative of soup dishes served with rice. Miso soup is also called omiotsuke (\u5fa1\u5473\u5fa1\u4ed8). Along with suimono (clear soup seasoned with a small amount of soy sauce and salt in a dashi stock), miso soup is considered to be one of the two basic soup types of Japanese cuisine.[1] The type of miso paste chosen for the soup defines a great deal of its character and flavor. Miso pastes (a traditional Japanese seasoning produced by fermenting soybeans with salt and the fungus Aspergillus oryzae, known in Japanese as k\u014djikin\u00a0[ja] (\u9eb9\u83cc), and sometimes rice, barley, or other ingredients) can be categorized into red (akamiso), white (shiromiso), or mixed (awase).[2] There are many variations within these themes, including regional variations, such as Shinsh\u016b miso or Sendai miso\u00a0[ja]. The amount of time taken also affects its flavor: a miso paste that has been fermented for a shorter period of time, such as a white miso, provides a lighter, sweeter flavor, while one which has been fermented for a longer period, such as a red miso, gives the miso soup a stronger, deeper one.[3] More than 80% of Japan's annual production of miso is used in miso soup, and 75% of all Japanese people consume miso soup at least once a day.[4] The most common dashi soup stocks for miso soup are made of niboshi (dried baby sardines), kombu (dried kelp), katsuobushi (thin shavings of dried and smoked bonito (similar to skipjack tuna)), or hoshi-shiitake (dried shiitake). The kombu can also be used in combination with katsuobushi or hoshi-shiitake. The kelp and/or shiitake dashi serve as a vegetarian soup stock.[5] When the ingredients involve shellfish such as Asari clam (Venerupis philippinarum), Shijimi (Corbicula japonica), or Hamaguri (Meretrix lusoria) they will impart flavorings that serve the role of dashi and thus it is not necessary to prepare any stock in advance. Outside Japan, American or European style miso soup is sometimes made by dissolving miso in a Western vegetable stock. The stock might include ingredients such as negi, carrot, potato and daikon radish. In some versions of the dish, chicken stock, Western-style fish stock, and other non-dashi bases can even be used, but there is some debate over whether or not miso soups made using these non-traditional bases count as true miso soup. According to Japanese custom, ingredients are chosen to reflect the seasons and to provide contrasts of color, texture, and flavor. Thus negi and tofu, a strongly flavored ingredient mixed with a mildly flavored ingredient, are often combined. Ingredients that float, such as wakame seaweed, and ingredients that sink, such as potatoes, are also combined. Ingredients may include mushrooms (nameko or shiitake), potato, taro, seaweed, green laver, onion, nira, common bean, mitsuba, shrimp, fish, clams, and sliced daikon. Nearly any Japanese ingredient is added to some type of miso soup. However, typical miso soup recipes contain a small number of additional ingredients beyond dashi stock and miso. If pork is added to miso soup, it is called tonjiru, meaning \"pork soup\". Tonjiru is a soup served for dinner and lunch and is not usually eaten as breakfast soup. Hearty and robust cold weather variations may include daikon, deep-fried tofu called abura-age, potatoes, onions and dark miso varieties. Lighter variations are better suited for spring or summer months and made with ingredients like cabbage, seri, myoga and/or eggplant. Miso soup can be prepared in several ways, depending on the chef and the style of soup. Japanese recipes usually call for most vegetables to be cooked in the simmering dashi, particularly mushrooms, daikon, carrots, potatoes, tofu, and fish. The miso is suspended separately in some dashi stock removed from the simmering mix, to keep the miso paste from cooking, which alters the flavour, kills beneficial bacteria, and reduces the health benefits of biologically active miso paste. When the vegetables are cooked, the stock is removed from heat, the miso suspension is added and mixed into the soup, any uncooked ingredients are added, and the dish is served. In Japan, miso soup and white rice make up the central dishes of the traditional Japanese breakfast. The soup has been a favorite of commoners and royalty alike for many centuries, but there are also many other dishes involving breakfast. They are all quite small, some include egg, fish, and natt\u014d which is a fermented soybean. The soup is usually served in lacquer bowls with lids and drunk directly from the bowl, though the solid ingredients are eaten with chopsticks. The bowl sometimes has a lid to keep heat and aroma in as well as to improve the presentation.[6] Instant miso soup is available in single-serving packets. It is usually sold in dehydrated powder and paste forms, though it is sometimes also sold freeze dried. It generally contains dried toppings such as wakame and tofu with soybeans that reconstitute rapidly on the addition of hot water.[7] These are popular in the Japanese workplace, where miso soup can be made with lunch as easily as green tea and using the same water. Instant miso soup is available in many grocery stores outside Japan. It has a shelf life of 3 to 12 months. Wappani (\u308f\u3063\u3071\u716e) is a miso-soup-based dish unique to Awashima island off the coast of Niigata, Japan. A cedar flask (\"wappa\"\u00a0[ja]) is filled with miso soup, fish and vegetables. It is then heated by dropping in hot rocks, which quickly brings it to a simmer. Hot rocks retain their heat for hours after being taken from the fire, so a hot meal can be prepared without the use of fire.[8] In 2003, researchers at Japan's National Cancer Centre suggested that eating three or more bowls of miso soup every day could lower the risk of breast cancer in women.[9] Studies in 2020 have shown that habitual consumption of miso soup has the effect of lowering blood pressure and heart rate,[10] and the effect of causing proliferation of good bacteria in the intestines and helping prevent constipation.[11] A 2003 epidemiology study in Japan discovered that persons who consume miso soup daily have a lower risk of stomach cancer and heart disease. In 2019 a research concluded that fermented soy foods, such as miso, have antidiabetic, antioxidative (anti aging), anti-obesity, anti\u2010inflammatory,  anticancer, as well as antihypertensive (lowering blood pressure) properties.[12] Hot", "Pho": "Ph\u1edf or Pho[a] (UK: /f\u025c\u02d0/, US: /f\u028c/ FUH, Canada: /f\u0254\u02d0/ FAW; Vietnamese: [f\u0259\u02d0\u02e7\u02e9\u02e7] \u24d8) is a Vietnamese soup dish consisting of broth, rice noodles (b\u00e1nh ph\u1edf), herbs, and meat (usually beef (ph\u1edf b\u00f2)), sometimes chicken (ph\u1edf g\u00e0).[3][4] Ph\u1edf is a popular food in Vietnam[5] where it is served in households, street-stalls, and restaurants country-wide. Residents of the city of Nam \u0110\u1ecbnh were the first to create Vietnamese traditional ph\u1edf. It is considered Vietnam's national dish,[6] and is said to be influenced by Cantonese and French cultures.[7] Ph\u1edf originated in the early 20th century in Northern Vietnam, and after the Vietnam War, refugees popularized it throughout the world. Because ph\u1edf's origins are poorly documented,[8][9] there is disagreement over the cultural influences that led to its development in Vietnam, as well as the etymology of the name.[10] The Hanoi (northern) and Saigon (southern) styles of pho differ by noodle width, sweetness of broth, and choice of herbs and sauce. In 2017, Vietnam made 12 December the \"Day of Pho\".[11] Ph\u1edf likely evolved from similar noodle dishes. Its origins will always be debated, but the emphasis on beef in Vietnamese cuisine and the dish's evolution is likely attributed to French influence.[citation needed]  For example, villagers in V\u00e2n C\u00f9 say they ate ph\u1edf long before the French colonial period.[12] The modern form emerged between 1900 and 1907 in northern Vietnam,[1][8] southeast of Hanoi in Nam \u0110\u1ecbnh Province, then a substantial textile market. The traditional home of ph\u1edf is reputed to be the villages of V\u00e2n C\u00f9 and Dao C\u00f9 (or Giao C\u00f9) in \u0110\u00f4ng Xu\u00e2n commune, Nam Tr\u1ef1c District, Nam \u0110\u1ecbnh Province.[12][13] Cultural historian and researcher Tr\u1ecbnh Quang D\u0169ng believes that the popularization and origins of modern pho stemmed from the intersection of several historical and cultural factors in the early 20th century.[14] These include improved availability of beef due to French demand, which in turn produced beef bones that were purchased by Chinese workers to make into a dish similar to ph\u1edf called ng\u01b0u nh\u1ee5c ph\u1ea5n.[14][15] The demand for this dish was initially the greatest with workers from the provinces of Yunnan and Guangdong, who had an affinity for the dish due to its similarities to that of their homeland, which eventually popularized and familiarized this dish with the general population.  This can be disputed as beef to this day holds a more prominent role in Vietnamese cuisine as opposed to Chinese.  The Western onion which plays a crucial role in the cooking of the dish was not introduced into Asia until the French.[15] Ph\u1edf was originally sold at dawn and dusk by itinerant street vendors, who shouldered mobile kitchens on carrying poles (g\u00e1nh ph\u1edf).[16] From the pole hung two wooden cabinets, one housing a cauldron over a wood fire, the other storing noodles, spices, cookware, and space to prepare a bowl of ph\u1edf. The heavy g\u00e1nh was always shouldered by men.[17] They kept their heads warm with distinctive felt hats called m\u0169 ph\u1edf.[18] Hanoi's first two fixed ph\u1edf stands were a Vietnamese-owned C\u00e1t T\u01b0\u1eddng on C\u1ea7u G\u1ed7 Street and a Chinese-owned stand in front of B\u1edd H\u1ed3 tram stop. They were joined in 1918 by two more on Qu\u1ea1t Row and \u0110\u1ed3ng Row.[19] Around 1925, a V\u00e2n C\u00f9 villager named V\u1ea1n opened the first \"Nam \u0110\u1ecbnh style\" pho stand in Hanoi.[20] G\u00e1nh ph\u1edf declined in number around 1936\u20131946 in favor of stationary eateries.[18] In the late 1920s, various vendors experimented with h\u00fang l\u00ecu, sesame oil, tofu, and even Lethocerus indicus extract (c\u00e0 cu\u1ed1ng). This \"ph\u1edf c\u1ea3i l\u01b0\u01a1ng\" failed to enter the mainstream.[19][21] Ph\u1edf t\u00e1i, served with cooked beef, had been introduced by 1930. Chicken pho appeared in 1939, possibly because beef was not sold at the markets on Mondays and Fridays at the time.[19] With the partition of Vietnam in 1954, over a million people fled North Vietnam for South Vietnam. Ph\u1edf, previously unpopular in the South, suddenly became popular.[13] No longer confined to northern culinary traditions, variations in meat and broth appeared, and additional garnishes, such as lime, mung bean sprouts (gi\u00e1 \u0111\u1ed7), culantro (ng\u00f2 gai), cinnamon basil (h\u00fang qu\u1ebf), Hoisin sauce (t\u01b0\u01a1ng \u0111en), and hot Sriracha sauce (t\u01b0\u01a1ng \u1edbt) became standard fare.[8][13][19] Ph\u1edf t\u00e1i also began to rival fully cooked ph\u1edf ch\u00edn in popularity. Migrants from the North similarly popularized b\u00e1nh m\u00ec sandwiches.[22] Meanwhile, in North Vietnam, private ph\u1edf restaurants were nationalized (m\u1eadu d\u1ecbch qu\u1ed1c doanh)[23] and began serving ph\u1edf noodles made from old rice. Street vendors were forced to use noodles made of imported potato flour.[24][25] Officially banned as capitalism, these vendors prized portability, carrying their wares on g\u00e1nh and setting out plastic stools for customers.[26] During the so-called subsidy period following the Vietnam War, state-owned pho eateries served a meatless variety of the dish known as pilotless pho (ph\u1edf kh\u00f4ng ng\u01b0\u1eddi l\u00e1i),[27] in reference to the U.S. Air Force's unmanned reconnaissance drones. The broth consisted of boiled water with MSG added for taste, as there were often shortages of various foodstuffs like meat and rice during that period.[28] Bread or cold rice was often served as a side dish, leading to the present-day practice of dipping qu\u1ea9y (deep-fried wheat flour dough) in pho.[29] Pho eateries were privatized as part of \u0110\u1ed5i M\u1edbi. Many street vendors must still maintain a light footprint to evade police enforcing the street tidiness rules that replaced the ban on private ownership.[26] In the aftermath of the Vietnam War, Vietnamese refugees brought pho to many countries. Restaurants specializing in ph\u1edf appeared in numerous Asian enclaves and Little Saigons, such as in Paris and in major cities in the United States, Canada and Australia.[30][31] In 1980, the first of hundreds of ph\u1edf restaurants opened in the Little Saigon in Orange County, California.[32] In the United States, ph\u1edf began to enter the mainstream during the 1990s, as relations between the U.S. and Vietnam improved.[31] At that time Vietnamese restaurants began opening quickly in Texas and California, spreading rapidly along the Gulf and West Coasts, as well as the East Coast and the rest of the country. During the 2000s, ph\u1edf restaurants in the United States generated US$500\u00a0 million in annual revenue, according to an unofficial estimate.[33] Ph\u1edf can now be found in cafeterias at many college and corporate campuses, especially on the West Coast.[31] The word \"pho\" was added to the Shorter Oxford English Dictionary in 2007.[34] Ph\u1edf is listed at number 28 on \"World's 50 most delicious foods\" compiled by CNN Go in 2011.[35] The Vietnamese Embassy in Mexico celebrated Ph\u1edf Day on April 3, 2016, with Osaka Prefecture holding a similar commemoration the following day.[36] Ph\u1edf has been adopted by other Southeast Asian cuisines, including Lao and Hmong cuisine.[4] It sometimes appears as \"Ph\u00f4\" on menus in Australia.[citation needed] Reviews of 19th and 20th-century Vietnamese literature have found that pho entered the mainstream sometime in the 1910s. Georges Dumoutier's extensive 1907 account of Vietnamese cuisine omits any mention of ph\u1edf.[10] The word appears in a short story published in 1907.[38] Nguy\u1ec5n C\u00f4ng Hoan recalls its sale by street vendors in 1913.[39] A 1931 dictionary is the first to define ph\u1edf as a soup: \"from the word ph\u1ea5n. A dish consisting of small slices of rice cake boiled with beef.\"[10][18][40] Possibly the earliest English-language reference to pho was in the book Recipes of All Nations, edited by Countess Morphy in 1935: In the book, pho is described as \"an Annamese soup held in high esteem ... made with beef, a veal bone, onions, a bay leaf, salt, and pepper, and a small teaspoon of nuoc-mam (fish sauce).\"[41] There are two prevailing theories on the origin of the word ph\u1edf and, by extension, the dish itself. As author Nguy\u1ec5n D\u01b0 notes, both questions are significant to Vietnamese identity.[16] French settlers commonly ate beef, whereas Vietnamese traditionally ate pork and chicken and used cattle as beasts of burden.[23][42] Gustave Hue (1937) equates ch\u00e1o ph\u1edf to the French beef stew pot-au-feu (literally, \"pot on the fire\").[10] Accordingly, Western sources generally maintain that ph\u1edf is derived from pot-au-feu in both name and substance.[2][10][43] However, several scholars dispute this etymology on the basis of the stark differences between the two dishes.[10][20][44] Another suggestion of a separate origin is that ph\u1edf in French has long been pronounced [fo] rather than [f\u00f8]: in Jean Tardieu's Lettre de Hano\u00ef \u00e0 Roger Martin Du Gard (1928), a soup vendor cries \"Pho-\u00f4!\" in the street.[25] Many Hanoians explain that the word ph\u1edf derives from French soldiers' ordering \"feu\" (fire) from g\u00e1nh ph\u1edf, referring to both the steam rising from a bowl of ph\u1edf and the wood fire seen glowing from a g\u00e1nh ph\u1edf in the evening.[18] Food historian Erica J. Peters argues that the French have embraced ph\u1edf in a way that overlooks its origins as a local improvisation, reinforcing \"an idea that the French brought modern ingenuity to a traditionalist Vietnam\".[25] Hue and Eug\u00e8n Gouin (1957) both define ph\u1edf by itself as an abbreviation of l\u1ee5c ph\u1edf. Elucidating on the 1931 dictionary, Gouin and L\u00ea Ng\u1ecdc Tr\u1ee5 (1970) both give l\u1ee5c ph\u1edf as a corruption of ng\u01b0u nh\u1ee5c ph\u1ea5n (Chinese: \u725b\u8089\u7c89; Cantonese Yale: ngau4 yuk6 fan2; \"cow meat noodles\"), which was commonly sold by Chinese immigrants in Hanoi.[10] ([\u0272] is an allophone of /l/ in some northern dialects of Vietnamese.) Some scholars argue that ph\u1edf (the dish) evolved from x\u00e1o tr\u00e2u, a Vietnamese dish common in Hanoi at the turn of the century. Originally eaten by commoners near the Red River, it consisted of stir-fried strips of water buffalo meat served in broth atop rice vermicelli.[45] Around 1908\u20131909, the shipping industry brought an influx of laborers. Vietnamese and Chinese cooks set up g\u00e1nh to serve them x\u00e1o tr\u00e2u but later switched to inexpensive scraps of beef[10][12] set aside by butchers who sold to the French.[46] Chinese vendors advertised this x\u00e1o b\u00f2 by crying out, \"Beef and noodles!\" (Cantonese Yale: ng\u00e0uh yuhk f\u00e1n; Vietnamese: ng\u01b0u nh\u1ee5c ph\u1ea5n).[20] Eventually the street cry became \"Meat and noodles!\" (Chinese: \u8089\u7c89; Cantonese Yale: yuhk f\u00e1n; Vietnamese: nh\u1ee5c ph\u1ea5n), with the last syllable elongated.[13][18] Nguy\u1ec5n Ng\u1ecdc B\u00edch suggests that the final \"n\" was eventually dropped because of the similar-sounding ph\u1ea9n (traditional Chinese: \u7cde; simplified Chinese: \u7caa; \"excrement\").[9][47] The French author Jean Marquet refers to the dish as \"Yoc feu!\" in his 1919 novel Du village-\u00e0-la cit\u00e9.[46] This is likely what the Vietnamese poet T\u1ea3n \u0110\u00e0 calls \"nh\u1ee5c-ph\u1edf\" in \"\u0110\u00e1nh b\u1ea1c\" (\"Gambling\"), written around 1915\u20131917.[16][44] Ph\u1edf uses a common variety of Chinese rice noodle called ho fun, (traditional Chinese: \u6cb3\u7c89; simplified Chinese: \u6cb3\u7c89; Cantonese Yale: ho4 fen3) which is believed to have originated in the town of Shahe (Chinese: \u6c99\u6cb3; pinyin: Sh\u0101h\u00e9; Jyutping: Sa1ho4*2), now part of the Tianhe District of Guangzhou in Guangdong province, southern China.[48][circular reference] The Cantonese also use the word (Chinese: \u6cb3; Cantonese Yale: ho4 ho4*2; \"(Sha)he noodles\") as well as (Chinese: \u725b\u8089\u7c89; Cantonese Yale: ngau4 yuk6 fan2; \"cow meat noodles\") to describe Ph\u1edf. The two words share close approximation and could be a cognate of one another when considering varying regional and dialectical pronunciation differences. Ph\u1edf is served in a bowl with a specific cut of flat rice noodles in clear beef broth, with thin cuts of beef (steak, fatty flank, lean flank, brisket). Variations feature slow-cooked tendon, tripe, or meatballs in southern Vietnam. Chicken pho is made using the same spices as beef, but the broth is made using chicken bones and meat, as well as some internal organs of the chicken, such as the heart, the undeveloped eggs, and the gizzard.[49][50] When eating at ph\u1edf stalls in Vietnam, customers are generally asked which parts of the beef they would like and how they want it done. Beef parts include: For chicken ph\u1edf, options might include: The thick dried rice noodle that is usually used is called b\u00e1nh ph\u1edf, but some versions may be made with freshly made rice noodles called b\u00e1nh ph\u1edf t\u01b0\u01a1i in Vietnamese or kuay tiao.[51][52] These noodles are labeled on packaging as b\u00e1nh ph\u1edf t\u01b0\u01a1i (fresh pho noodles).[53]\nPho noodles are usually medium-width; however, people from different regions of Vietnam will prefer different widths. The soup for beef ph\u1edf is generally made by simmering beef bones, oxtails, flank steak, charred onion, charred ginger, and spices. For a more intense flavor, the bones may still have beef on them. Chicken bones also work and produce a similar broth. Seasonings can include Saigon cinnamon or other kinds of cinnamon as alternatives (may use usually in stick form, sometimes in powder form in pho restaurant franchises overseas), star anise, roasted ginger, roasted onion, black cardamom, coriander seed, fennel seed, and clove.[54]  The broth takes several hours to make.[50] For chicken ph\u1edf, only the meat and bones of the chicken are used in place of beef and beef bone. The remaining spices remain the same, but the charred ginger can be omitted since its function in beef ph\u1edf is to subdue the quite strong smell of beef. The spices, often wrapped in cheesecloth or a soaking bag to prevent them from floating all over the pot, usually contain cloves, star anise, coriander seed, fennel, cinnamon, black cardamom, ginger, and onion. Careful cooks often roast ginger and onion over an open fire for about a minute before adding them to the stock, to bring out their full flavor. They also skim off all the impurities that float to the top while cooking; this is the key to a clear broth. N\u01b0\u1edbc m\u1eafm (fish sauce) is added toward the end. The Northern pho is typically served with scallion, onion and cilantro (coriander leaves). The Southern variant also adds Thai basil and bean sprouts. Thai chili peppers, lime wedges, fish sauce, chili oil, hot chili sauce (such as Sriracha sauce), pickled garlic (Northern style) or hoisin sauce (Southern style) may be added to taste as accompaniments.[55][50][56] Several ingredients not generally served with ph\u1edf may be ordered by request. Extra-fatty broth (n\u01b0\u1edbc b\u00e9o) can be ordered and comes with scallions to sweeten it. A popular side dish ordered upon request is h\u00e0nh d\u1ea5m, or vinegared white onions. The several regional variants of pho in Vietnam, particularly divided between \"Northern ph\u1edf\" (ph\u1edf B\u1eafc) or \"Hanoi ph\u1edf\" (ph\u1edf H\u00e0 N\u1ed9i), and \"Southern ph\u1edf\" (ph\u1edf Nam) or \"Saigon pho\" (ph\u1edf S\u00e0i G\u00f2n). Northern Vietnamese ph\u1edf uses a savoury, clear broth, blanched whole green onion, and garnishes offered generally include only diced green onion and cilantro, pickled garlic, chili sauce and qu\u1ea9y. The Northern pho is often described as subtle and light on spices, while having a deep savory taste from beef bones.[57] [58] On the other hand, southern Vietnamese ph\u1edf broth is sweeter and cloudier, and is consumed with bean sprouts, fresh sliced chili, hoisin sauce and a greater variety of fresh herbs. Ph\u1edf may be served with either ph\u1edf noodles or kuy teav noodles (h\u1ee7 ti\u1ebfu).[59] The variations in meat, broth, and additional garnishes such as lime, bean sprouts, ng\u00f2 gai (culantro), h\u00fang qu\u1ebf (Thai basil), and t\u01b0\u01a1ng \u0111en (hoisin sauce), t\u01b0\u01a1ng \u1edbt (chili sauce) appear to be innovations made by or introduced to the South.[8] Another style of northern ph\u1edf is Ph\u1edf Nam \u0110\u1ecbnh from Nam \u0110\u1ecbnh city which uses more fish sauce in the broth and wider noodles.[60] Other provincial variations exist where pho is served with delicacy meats other than beef or chicken such as duck, buffalo, goat or veal. Ph\u1edf has many variants including many dishes bearing the name \"ph\u1edf\", many are not soup-based: Other provinces: Vietnamese beef soup can also refer to b\u00fan b\u00f2 Hu\u1ebf, which is a spicy beef noodle soup, is associated with Hu\u1ebf in central Vietnam. Famous ph\u1edf shops in Hanoi are Ph\u1edf B\u00e1t \u0110\u00e0n, Ph\u1edf Th\u00ecn B\u1edd H\u1ed3, Ph\u1edf Th\u00ecn L\u00f2 \u0110\u00fac, Ph\u1edf 10 L\u00fd Qu\u1ed1c S\u01b0. In 2016, BBC noted Pho 10 Ly Quoc Su to be among the best pho addresses in Vietnam.[57] Ph\u1edf Th\u00ecn L\u00f2 \u0110\u00fac has also opened foreign branches in Australia, Japan and the U.S.[62] Famous ph\u1edf shops in Saigon included Ph\u1edf B\u1eafc H\u1ea3i, Ph\u1edf C\u00f4ng L\u00fd, Ph\u1edf T\u00e0u Bay, Ph\u1edf T\u00e0u Th\u1ee7y, and Ph\u1edf B\u00e0 D\u1eadu. Pasteur Street (ph\u1ed1 ph\u1edf Pasteur) was a street famous for its beef ph\u1edf, while Hien Vuong Street (ph\u1ed1 ph\u1edf Hi\u1ec1n V\u01b0\u01a1ng) was known for its chicken ph\u1edf.[63] At Ph\u1edf B\u00ecnh, American soldiers dined as Vi\u1ec7t C\u1ed9ng agents planned the T\u1ebft Offensive just upstairs.[64][65] Nowadays in Ho Chi Minh City, well-known restaurants include: Ph\u1edf H\u00f9ng, Ph\u1edf H\u00f2a Pasteur[66] and Ph\u1edf 2000, which U.S. President Bill Clinton visited in 2000.[31][42] One of the largest ph\u1edf chains in Vietnam is Pho 24, a subsidiary of Highlands Coffee, with 60 locations in Vietnam and 20 abroad.[67] The largest ph\u1edf chain in the United States is Ph\u1edf H\u00f2a, which operates over 70 locations in seven countries.[31][68][69] A similar restaurant named Pho 75 serves in the Washington, D.C., and Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, areas in the United States.[70] Numbers in the restaurant name are \"lucky\" numbers for the owners: culturally lucky numbers or to mark a date in Vietnam or their personal history.[71] Many ph\u1edf restaurants in the United States offer oversized helpings with names such as \"train ph\u1edf\" (ph\u1edf xe l\u1eeda), \"airplane ph\u1edf\" (ph\u1edf t\u00e0u bay), or \"California ph\u1edf\" (ph\u1edf Ca Li).[16][18][29] Some restaurants have offered a ph\u1edf eating challenge, with prizes for finishing as much as 10 pounds (4.5\u00a0kg) of ph\u1edf in one sitting,[72] or have auctioned special versions costing $5,000.[73][74] \"pho, n.\".

Food portal Hot", "Hummus": " Hummus (/\u02c8h\u028am\u0259s/, /\u02c8h\u028cm\u0259s/;[1][2] Arabic: \u062d\u064f\u0645\u064f\u0651\u0635 \u1e25ummu\u1e63, 'chickpeas'), also spelled hommus or houmous, is a Middle Eastern dip, spread, or savory dish made from cooked, mashed chickpeas blended with tahini, lemon juice, and garlic.[3] The standard garnish in the Middle East includes olive oil, a few whole chickpeas, parsley, and paprika.[4][5] The earliest mention of hummus was in a 13th century cookbook attributed to the Aleppine historian Ibn al-Adim.[6] Commonly consumed in Middle Eastern cuisine, it is usually eaten as a dip with pita bread. In the West, it is produced industrially and consumed as a snack or appetizer with crackers or vegetables. The word hummus is Arabic: \u062d\u064f\u0645\u064f\u0651\u0635, romanized:\u00a0\u1e25ummu\u1e63 'chickpeas'.[7][2][8] The full name of the prepared spread in Arabic is \u1e25ummu\u1e63 bi \u1e6da\u1e25\u012bna 'chickpeas with tahini'.[9] The colloquial Arabic word \u1e25ummu\u1e63 is a variant of the Arabic \u1e25imma\u1e63 or \u1e25immi\u1e63 which may be derived from the Aramaic language (\u05d7\u05de\u05e6\u05d9 \u1e25em\u1e63\u012bn, \u1e25em\u1e63\u0101y[10]), corresponding to the Syriac word for chickpeas: \u1e25em(m)\u1e63\u0113.[11] The word entered the English language around the mid-20th century from the Arabic \u1e25ummu\u1e63 or via its borrowing for the name of the dish in Turkish: humus.[12][13] Spelling of the word in English can be inconsistent, though most major dictionaries from American and British publishers give hummus as the primary spelling. Some American dictionaries give hommos as an alternative, while British dictionaries give houmous or hoummos.[14][2][11] The major British supermarkets use houmous.[15][16][17][18][19] Other spellings include homous, houmos, houmus, and similar variants. While humus (as it is spelled in Turkish) is sometimes found, it is avoided as a heteronym of humus, organic matter in soil.[14] Although multiple different theories and claims of origins exist in various parts of the Middle East, evidence is insufficient to determine the precise location or time of the invention of hummus.[20] Its basic ingredients\u2014chickpeas, sesame, lemon, and garlic\u2014have been combined and eaten in Egypt and the Levant for centuries.[21][22] Though regional populations widely ate chickpeas, and often cooked them in stews and other hot dishes,[23] pur\u00e9ed chickpeas eaten cold with tahini do not appear in records before the Abbasid Caliphate in Egypt and the Levant.[24] The earliest mention of Hummus comes from Syria, in a 13th-century cookbook attributed to the Aleppine historian Ibn al-Adim.[6][25] Other early written recipes for a dish resembling \u1e25ummu\u1e63 bi \u1e6da\u1e25\u012bna are recorded in cookbooks written in Cairo in the 13th century.[20][26] A cold pur\u00e9e of chickpeas with vinegar and pickled lemons with herbs, spices, and oil, but no tahini or garlic, appears in the Treasure Trove of Benefits and Variety at the Table (\u0643\u0646\u0632 \u0627\u0644\u0641\u0648\u0627\u0626\u062f \u0641\u064a \u062a\u0646\u0648\u064a\u0639 \u0627\u0644\u0645\u0648\u0627\u0626\u062f);[27][24] and a pur\u00e9e of chickpeas and tahini called hummus kasa appears in Mu\u1e25ammad ibn al-\u1e24asan ibn al-Kar\u012bm's The Book of Dishes:[28] it is based on pur\u00e9ed chickpeas and tahini, and acidulated with vinegar (not lemon), but it also contains many spices, herbs, and nuts, and no garlic. It is also served by rolling it out and letting it sit overnight.[29] As an appetizer and dip, diners scoop hummus with flatbread, such as pita.[30] It is also served as part of a meze or as an accompaniment to falafel, grilled chicken, fish, or eggplant.[30] Hummus is a common dip in Egypt where it is eaten with pita,[31] and frequently flavored with cumin or other spices.[30][31][32] In the Levant, hummus has long been a staple food, often served as a warm dish, with bread for breakfast, lunch or dinner. All of the ingredients in hummus are easily found in gardens, farms and markets, thus adding to the availability and popularity of the dish. Hummus is usually garnished with olive oil, \"nana\" mint leaves, paprika, and parsley.[33] Hummus is a common part of everyday meals in Israel. It is made from ingredients that, following Kashrut (Jewish dietary laws), can be combined with both meat and dairy meals. Chickpea dishes have long been part of the cuisine of Jews who lived in the Middle East and Northern Africa. The many Mizrahi Jewish immigrants from these countries brought their own unique variations, such as hummus with fried eggplant and boiled eggs prepared by Iraqi Jews. Israeli versions use large amounts of tahini for a creamier texture.[34] One author calls hummus, \"One of the most popular and best-known of all Syrian dishes\" and a \"must on any mezzeh table.\"[35] Syrian and Lebanese in Canada's Arab diaspora prepare and consume hummus along with other dishes like falafel, kibbeh and tabbouleh, even among the third- and fourth-generation offspring of the original immigrants.[36] In Cyprus, hummus is part of the local cuisine in both Turkish Cypriot and Greek Cypriot communities where it is called \"humoi\" (Greek: \u03c7\u03bf\u03cd\u03bc\u03bf\u03b9).[37][38] In the United Kingdom, hummus was popularized by Greek Cypriot caterers, sometimes leading to a perception of it being a Greek food.[39] In Turkey, hummus is considered a meze.[40] In France, in the region of Provence, there is a dish called poichichade that resembles hummus.[41] In the United States and Europe, hummus is commercially available in numerous traditional and non-traditional varieties, such as beet or chocolate.[42] Chickpeas, the main ingredient of conventional hummus, have appreciable amounts of dietary fiber, protein, vitamin B6, manganese and other nutrients.[43] As hummus recipes vary, so does nutritional content, depending primarily on the relative proportions of chickpeas, tahini, and water. Hummus provides roughly 170 calories for 100 grams, and is a good to excellent (more than 10% of the Daily Value) source of dietary fiber, vitamin B6, and several dietary minerals.[44][45] Fat content, mostly from tahini and olive oil, is about 14% of the total; other major components are 65% water, 17% total carbohydrates, including a small amount of sugar, and about 10% protein.[44][45] In the 1980s, the supermarket Waitrose was the first British supermarket to stock hummus. Hummus was popularized in the UK by chefs such as Yotam Ottolenghi, Claudia Roden and Anissa Helou. As of 2013, \u00a360 million worth of hummus was sold in the UK each year, and one survey found that 41% of Britons had hummus in their fridge, twice as many as the rest of Europe. A Waitrose spokesperson said it had become a grocery staple.[46] In 2006, hummus was present in 12 percent of American households, rising to 17 percent by early 2009.[47] One commentator attributed the growth of hummus to America's embrace of ethnic and exotic foods.[47] While in 2006\u201308 when some 15 million Americans consumed hummus, and annual national sales were about $5 million, sales growth in 2016 was reflected by an estimated 25% of US households consuming hummus.[48] By 2016, the leading American hummus manufacturer, Sabra Dipping Company, held a 62% market share for hummus sales in the United States, and was forecast to exceed $1 billion in sales in 2017.[48][49][50] To meet the rising consumer demand for hummus, American farmers increased their production of chickpeas four-fold since 2009, harvesting more than 100,000,000 pounds (45,000,000\u00a0kg) in 2015, an increase from 25,000,000 pounds (11,000,000\u00a0kg) in 2009.[48] Hummus consumption has been so popular that many tobacco farmers have switched to growing chickpeas to meet demand.[51] Hummus is often seen as an unofficial \"national dish\" of Israel, reflecting its huge popularity and significance among the entire Israeli population,[30] which Israel's critics describe as an appropriation of Lebanese,[52] Palestinian or Arab culture.[53] According to Ofra Tene and Dafna Hirsch, the dispute over ownership of hummus, exposes nationalism through food and the important role played by the industrialization of hummus made by Israeli private companies in 1958.[54][55] Although, hummus has traditionally been part of the cuisine of the Mizrahi Jews who lived in Arabic-speaking lands, the dish was also popularized among the Jewish immigrants from Europe in the late 19th and early 20th century. Historian Dafna Hirsch describes its adoption in their diet as part of an attempt of blending in the Middle Eastern environment,[56] while sociologist Rafi Grosglick points out the importance of its health aspects to their diet.[57] In recent years, through a process of gourmetization, the Arab identity of hummus became a marker of its authenticity, making famous Arab-Israeli villages such as Abu Gosh and Kafr Yasif. Hence, enthusiasts travel to the more remote Arab and Druze villages in the northern Galilee region in search of culinary experiences.[30][58][59] In October 2008, the Association of Lebanese Industrialists petitioned to the Lebanese Ministry of Economy and Trade to request protected status from the European Commission for hummus as a uniquely Lebanese food, similar to the Protected Geographical Status rights held over regional food items by various European Union countries.[60][61][62] As of 2009[update], the Lebanese Industrialists Association was still \"collecting documents and proof\" to support its claim.[63] The 2005 short film West Bank Story features a rivalry between two fictional restaurants, the Israeli \"Kosher King\" and the Palestinian \"Hummus Hut\". A parody of West Side Story, the film won the 2006 Academy Award for Best Live Action Short Film.[64] In 2012, Australian filmmaker Trevor Graham released a documentary, Make Hummus Not War, on the political and gastronomic aspects of hummus.[65] Lebanon and Israel's chefs have been engaged in a competition over the largest dish of hummus, as validated by the Guinness World Record, as a form of contestation of \"ownership\".[52] The \"title\" has gone back and forth between Israel (2008), Lebanon (2009), Israel (January 2010),[66] and, as of 2021[update], Lebanon (May 2010).[52][67][68] The winning dish, cooked by 300 cooks in the village of al-Fanar, near Beirut, weighed approximately 10,450 kilograms (23,040\u00a0lb), more than double the weight of the Israeli-Arab previous record.[69][70][71] According to local media, the recipe included eight tons of boiled chick peas, two tonnes of tahini, two tonnes of lemon juice, and 70 kilograms (150\u00a0lb) of olive oil.[67] Israeli author Meir Shalev claims that \u1e25ummu\u1e63 was mentioned in the Hebrew Bible, specifically Ruth 2:14 as \u1e25ome\u1e63;[72] even though \u1e25ome\u1e63 is glossed by the New Revised Standard Version (NRSV) as 'sour wine' (Ruth 2:14) and means 'vinegar' in modern Hebrew, Shalev traces \u1e25ome\u1e63 and \u1e25ummu\u1e63 as well as \u1e25im\u1e63a \"chickpea\" to one Semitic root \u1e25-m-\u1e63, claiming that chickpeas are named thus in Hebrew owing to their rapid fermentation.[72] However, Bristol-based author Harriet Nussbaum criticizes Shalev's identification of \u1e25ome\u1e63 in Ruth 2:14 with \u1e25ummu\u1e63: while accepting the linguistic connection proposed by Shalev, Nussbaum objects that \u1e25ome\u1e63 might not be \u1e25ummu\u1e63 but just another dish seasoned or preserved with fermented foodstuffs; and even if \u1e25ome\u1e63  meant chickpeas, there is no proof that in Biblical times chickpeas were prepared in the same manner as \u1e25ummu\u1e63 is.[73] Moreover, linguists Pelio Fronzaroli (1971) and Leonid Kogan (2011) reconstruct Proto-Semitic root *\u1e25m\u1e63\u0302- for Hebrew \u05d7\u05b9\u05de\u05b6\u05e5 \u1e25ome\u1e63 'vinegar', Arabic \u062d\u064e\u0627\u0645\u0650\u0636 \u1e25\u0101mi\u1e0d 'to be sour; acid' and Jewish Palestinian Aramaic \u1e25m\u0295.[74][75][76] Room temperature or warm", "Shakshuka": "Shakshouka (Arabic: \u0634\u0643\u0634\u0648\u0643\u0629\u00a0: \u0161ak\u0161\u016bkah, also spelled shakshuka or chakchouka) is a Maghrebi[1][2][3] dish of eggs poached in a sauce of tomatoes, olive oil, peppers, onion, and garlic, commonly spiced with cumin, paprika and cayenne pepper. Shakshouka is a popular dish throughout North Africa and the Middle East.[4] The word shakshouka (Arabic: \u0634\u0643\u0634\u0648\u0643\u0629) is a Maghrebi Arabic[5] term for \"a mixture\".[6][7][8][9] According to Mary Fitzgerald, the word is allegedly believed to come from the Berber languages,[10] although most sources agree on the term's Arabic origin. In Morocco, it is referred to as b\u012b\u1e0d w-ma\u1e6di\u0161a (\u0628\u064a\u0636 \u0648\u0645\u0637\u064a\u0634\u0629 \"egg and tomato\").[11] The term shakshouka may have derived from \"shak\", another Arabic word meaning \"to combine things together\", as the dish combines tomatoes, chilies and eggs.[4] Gil Marks, while noting some similarities with the Ottoman dish menemen, suggests that shakshouka evolved from \u015fak\u015fuka which spread to the Maghreb through the influence of the Ottoman Empire.[1] Anthony Buccini noted similarities between a wider range of vegetable stews. He and Noam Sienna conclude that both shakshouka and menemen, among other dishes like piperade and ratatouille, are members of a wider family of vegetable stews of common ancestry appearing throughout the western Mediterranean.[2][3] The migration of Maghrebi Jews in the 1950s brought the dish to Israel, where it was subsequently widely adopted despite not being previously present in Palestinian or Levantine cuisine.[1][2] Shakshouka began appearing in Israeli restaurants in the 1990s.[10] Many variations of the basic sauce are possible, varying in spice and sweetness. Some cooks add preserved lemon, salty sheep milk cheeses, olives, harissa or a spicy sausage such as chorizo or merguez.[12] Shakshouka is made with eggs, which are commonly poached but can also be scrambled, like in the Turkish menemen.[13][14] In Algeria, shakshouka is commonly eaten as a side dish, and there are countless variations of it, each with their own unique blend of ingredients. One such variation is hmiss, which is often served alongside traditional kesra bread. Hmiss typically includes grilled peppers, tomatoes, and garlic. In Tunisia, a similar dish called slata meshouia is enjoyed, but it differs from hmiss with the addition of onions, cumin and tuna. Some variations of shakshouka can be made with lamb mince, toasted whole spices, yogurt and fresh herbs.[15] Spices can include ground coriander, caraway, paprika, cumin and cayenne pepper.[16][17] Tunisian cooks may add potatoes, broad beans, artichoke hearts or courgettes to the dish.[18] The North African dish matbukha can be used as a base for shakshouka.[19] Because eggs are the main ingredient, it often appears on breakfast menus in English-speaking countries, but in the Arab world as well as Israel, it is also a popular evening meal,[20] and like hummus and falafel, is a Levantine regional favorite.[21] On the side, pickled vegetables and North African sausage called merguez might be served, or simply bread, with mint tea.[22] In Jewish culture, a large batch of tomato stew is made for the Sabbath dinner and the leftovers used the following morning to make a breakfast shakshouka with eggs.[14] In Andalusian cuisine, the dish is known as huevos a la flamenca; this version includes chorizo and serrano ham.[23] In Italian cuisine, there is a version of this dish called uova in purgatorio (eggs in purgatory) that adds garlic, basil or parsley.[24] Vegan variants replace the eggs with tofu.[25]", "Chili con Carne": " Chili con carne[a] is a spicy stew of Mexican origin containing chili peppers (sometimes in the form of chili powder), meat (usually beef), tomatoes, and often pinto beans or kidney beans.[2] Other seasonings may include garlic, onions, and cumin. The types of meat and other ingredients used vary based on geographic and personal tastes. Recipes provoke disputes among aficionados, some of whom insist that the word chili applies only to the basic dish, without beans and tomatoes. Chili con carne is a common dish for cook-offs, and may be used as a side, garnish, or ingredient in other dishes, such as soups or salsas.[3] In writings from 1529, the Franciscan friar Bernardino de Sahag\u00fan described chili pepper-seasoned stews being consumed in the Aztec capital, Tenochtitlan, now the location of Mexico City. The use of beef as the primary meat originated when the Spanish introduced cattle to Mexico.[2] Most of the beef being consumed in Mexico, especially by the Rancheros or cowboys in the 17th, 18th, and 19th centuries, was dried salted beef known as \u201ctasajo\u201d or \u201ccecina\u201d.[4] Tasajo was consumed in many dishes, including a stew of red chili sauce known as Carne con Chile, or meat with chili. Carne con chile was very common throughout much of Mexico, as it was an easy and cheap meal. An English naval officer and explorer, George Francis Lyon, wrote in 1826 about eating dried beef in a chili sauce with Rancheros while travelling through northern Veracruz, near P\u00e1nuco:[5] I then joined a party of Rancheros who had assembled to kill a cow and cut her flesh into tasajo, \u2014an operation which they performed with extraordinary skill and dispatch, separating the sinews from the flesh with anatomical precision. Two men devoted themselves to cutting the meat into long strings or ropes, which they threw to another who rubbed them well with salt: after this, no other process remained but to hang the beef in festoons over long poles to dry in the sun. I breakfasted with the Rancheros, when their work was done, on dry meat with chili sauce and piping hot tortillas served up in rapid succession. Our second course was a dish of cow's blood stewed with sweet herbs: and having prefaced our meal by a glass of white brandy distilled in the Rancho, we all ate heartily. French colonist Mathieu de Fossey had a similar experience in 1831 when he was served tasajo cooked in chili in the village of J\u00e1ltipan near Coatzacoalcos in southern Veracruz:[6] \u201cThat day we had a completely Indian meal, in which they served us tasajo cooked with chili, beans and tortillas. They call tasajo the meat that is dried in the sun after being salted and cut into long, thin strips to prevent putrefaction, which would be more active than the absorptive force of the sun, if one tried to dry it in thicker pieces, and despite this caution, it always retains an unpleasant smell and taste. In her book \u2014Life in Mexico (1843)\u2014 Scottish noblewoman Frances Erskine Inglis wrote about eating a dish called embarrado, a composition of meat and chili, while attending the rodeo (cattle roundup) and herradero (cattle branding celebration) in the village of Santiago in the state of Hidalgo in 1840:[7] \u201dThe Indians had cooked meat under the stones for us, which I found horrible, smelling and tasting of smoke. But we had also boiled fowls, and quantities of burning chili, hot tortillas, atole, or atolli, as the Indians call it, a species of cakes made of very fine maize and water, and sweetened with sugar or honey; embarrado, a favourite composition of meat and chili, very like mud, as the name imports, which I have not yet made up my mind to endure; quantities of fresh tunas, granaditas, bananas, aguacates, and other fruits, besides pulque, \u00e0 discr\u00e9tion. American traveler Theodore Taylor Johnson also wrote about eating carne con chile while in San Blas, Nayarit in 1849:[8] Returning to the town we obtained a true Mexican dinner, consisting of jerked beef stewed with onions and plenty of cayenne pepper, which they call \"carne con chile colorado\". This was accompanied by the ever lasting frijoles or beans; and for desert, delicious chocolate and tortillas. In Spanish, the term \"chile con carne\", consisting of the word chile (from the Nahuatl ch\u012blli) and con carne, Spanish for 'with meat', is first recorded in a book from 1857 about the Mexican\u2013American War.[2] A recipe dating back to the 1850s describes dried beef, suet, dried chili peppers and salt, which were pounded together, formed into bricks and left to dry, which could then be boiled in pots in an army encampment in Monterrey, of what is now Nuevo Le\u00f3n, Mexico.[2][9] Chili also became commonly prepared in northern Mexico and southern Texas.[10] Unlike some other Texas foods, such as barbecued brisket, chili largely originated with working-class Tejana and Mexican women.[10] The \"chili queens\" of San Antonio, Texas, were particularly famous in previous decades for selling their inexpensive chili-flavored beef stew in their casual \"chili joints\".[10] The San Antonio Chili Stand, in operation at the 1893 Columbian Exposition in Chicago, helped popularize chili by giving many Americans their first taste of it. San Antonio was a tourist destination and helped Texas-style chili con carne spread throughout the South and West of the United States.[11] Chili con carne is the official dish of the U.S. state of Texas as designated by the House Concurrent Resolution Number 18 of the 65th Texas Legislature during its regular session in 1977.[12] Before World War II, hundreds of small, family-run chili parlors could be found throughout Texas and other states, particularly those in which \u00e9migr\u00e9 Texans had made new homes. Each establishment usually had a claim to some kind of secret recipe. By 1904, chili parlors were opening outside of Texas, in part due to the availability of commercial versions of chili powder, first manufactured in Texas in the late 19th century.[13] After working at the Louisiana Purchase Exposition, Charles Taylor opened a chili parlor in Carlinville, Illinois, serving Mexican Chili.[14] Varallo's, the oldest restaurant in Tennessee, opened as a chili parlor in 1907, competing with other chili parlors that had opened in Nashville during the 1890s.[15] In the 1920s and 1930s, chains of diner-style chili parlors began opening in the Midwest. Cincinnati chili is a substantially different dish developed by Macedonian and Greek immigrants, deriving from their own culinary traditions. Dozens of restaurants offer this style throughout the Cincinnati area. It can be traced back to at least 1922, when the original Empress Chili location opened.[16] In Green Bay, Wisconsin, the chili parlor Chili John's has existed since 1913. As with Cincinnati chili, it is most commonly served over spaghetti with oyster crackers, but the recipe has more chili powder and a higher proportion of fat.[17] The original proprietor's son opened a second location in Burbank, California in 1946, which remains open. The Green Bay location closed in 2020.[18] Until the late 2000s, a chili parlor dating to 1904, O.T. Hodge, continued to operate in St. Louis. It featured a chili-topped dish called a slinger: two cheeseburger patties, hash browns, and two eggs, and smothered in chili.[19] As of 2014 no O.T. Hodge-branded locations remain, though Tully's Tap, a pub and restaurant in O'Fallon, Missouri, offers what it claims to be the original O.T. Hodge recipe on its menu. Beans, a staple of Tex-Mex cuisine, have been associated with chili as far back as the early 20th century.[20] The question of whether beans belong in chili has long been a matter of contention among chili cooks. While it is generally accepted that the earliest chilis did not include beans, proponents of their inclusion contend that chili with beans has a long enough history to be considered authentic.[21] The Chili Appreciation Society International specified in 1999 that, among other things, cooks are forbidden to include beans in the preparation of chili for official competition\u2014nor are they allowed to marinate any meats.[22] Small red or pink common beans are commonly used for chili, as are black beans, black-eyed peas, kidney beans, pinto beans, great northern beans, or navy beans. Most commercially prepared canned chili includes beans.[citation needed] Commercial chili prepared without beans is usually called \"chili no beans\" in the United States.[citation needed] Some U.S. manufacturers, notably Bush Brothers and Company and Eden Organic, also sell canned precooked beans (without meat) that are labeled \"chili beans\"; these beans are intended for consumers to add to a chili recipe and are often sold with spices added.[citation needed] Tomatoes are another ingredient on which opinions differ. Wick Fowler, a north Texas newspaperman and inventor of \"Two-Alarm Chili\" (which he later marketed as a kit of spices), insisted on adding tomato sauce to his chili in the ratio of one 15-ounce can per three pounds of meat (425 g per 1.36\u00a0kg). He also believed that chili should never be eaten freshly cooked, but refrigerated overnight to seal in the flavor. Matt Weinstock, a Los Angeles newspaper columnist, once remarked that Fowler's chili \"was reputed to open eighteen sinus cavities unknown to the medical profession\".[23] Vegetarian chili (also known as chili sin carne, chili without meat, chili non carne, and chili sans carne) acquired wide popularity in the U.S. during the 1960s and 1970s with the rise of vegetarianism. It is also popular with those on a diet restricting the use of red meat. To make the chili vegetarian, the cook leaves out the meat or replaces it with a meat analogue, such as textured vegetable protein or tofu, quinoa, or a starchy vegetable, such as potatoes. These chilis nearly always include beans. Variants may contain corn, squash, saut\u00e9ed mushrooms, pearl onions, shallots or beets. Chile verde ('green chile') is a moderately to extremely spicy New Mexican stew or sauce usually made from chunks of pork that have been slow-cooked in chicken broth, garlic, green tomatillos, and roasted green chile.[24] The spiciness of the chile is adjusted by the use of various peppers: Hatch chile, poblano, jalape\u00f1o, serrano, and occasionally habanero. Chile verde is a common filling for the Mission burrito.[citation needed] Cactus chili is a spicy Southwestern stew that is a variation on traditional chili con carne, usually containing traditional ingredients such as chili peppers, beef, tomatoes, and pinto beans, along with sliced cactus pieces.[25] It is traditionally cooked in a slow cooker and served with a side of salted crackers. Cactus chili is a relatively rare variation of chili con carne. However, it has gained prominence as a menu item at restaurant chains such as Showmars. White chili is made using chicken or turkey meat and broth, white beans, and green chili peppers. The resulting dish appears light in color when cooked. A white cheese, such as Monterey Jack, or sour cream are often added when served. The dish may be served with toppings or accompaniments; grated cheese, diced onions, and sour cream are common toppings, as are saltine crackers, tortilla chips or corn chips, cornbread, rolled-up corn or flour tortillas, and pork tamales. Chili can also be served over rice or pasta in dishes such as chili mac. Willie Gebhardt, originally of New Braunfels, Texas, and later of San Antonio, produced the first canned chili in 1908. Rancher Lyman Davis near Corsicana, Texas, developed Wolf Brand Chili in 1895. He owned a meat market and was a particular fan of Texas-style chili. In the 1880s, in partnership with an experienced range cook, he began producing heavily spiced chili based on chunks of lean beef and rendered beef suet, which he sold by the pot to local caf\u00e9s. In 1921, Davis began canning his product, naming it for his pet wolf, Kaiser Bill. Wolf Brand canned chili was a favorite of Will Rogers, who always took along a case when traveling and performing in other regions of the world. Ernest Tubb, the country singer, was such a fan that one Texas hotel maintained a supply of Wolf Brand for his visits. Both the Gebhardt and Wolf brands are now owned by ConAgra Foods, Inc. Another major maker of canned chili, Hormel, sells chili available with or without beans, made with turkey or in vegetarian varieties, under their own name and other brands like Stagg. Another method of marketing commercial chili in the days before widespread home refrigerators was \"brick chili\". It was produced by pressing out nearly all of the moisture, leaving a solid substance roughly the size and shape of a half-brick. Wolf Brand was originally sold in this form.[26] Commonly available in small towns and rural areas of the American Southwest in the first three-quarters of the 20th century, brick chili has largely been superseded by canned chili. A few manufacturers, such as XLNT Foods and Dolores Canning in Southern California, continue to distribute brick chili to supermarkets.[27][28] Home cooks may also purchase seasoning mixes for chili, including packets of dry ingredients such as chili powder, masa flour, salt, and cayenne pepper, to flavor meat and other ingredients.[citation needed] ", "French Onion Soup": "French onion soup (French: soupe \u00e0 l\u2019oignon [sup a l\u0254\u0272\u0254\u0303]) is a soup of onions, gently fried and then cooked in meat stock or water, usually served gratin\u00e9ed with croutons or a larger piece of bread covered with cheese floating on top. Onion soups were known in France since medieval times, but the version now familiar dates from the mid-19th century. Onion soups have been popular at least since Roman times.[1] Onions, a widely grown and generally inexpensive vegetable, were familiar in France, as elsewhere, from time immemorial.[2] Simone Beck, Louisette Bertholle and Julia Child comment in their Mastering the Art of French Cooking, \"It is hard to imagine a civilization without onions\".[3] In general the onion was regarded as peasant food and the upper classes avoided it:[2] in the middle of the 18th century a cookery book by the head chef to a French prince included a recipe for \"peasant-style onion soup\" \u2013 soupe \u00e0 l'oignon \u00e0  la Paysanne.[4] The food writer Waverley Root comments that the origins of French onion soup may lie in Alsace, although the dish is popular throughout France and \"apparently no region lays particular claim to it\".[5] Onion soups from other regions include the tourain from Quercy-P\u00e9rigord and the ouliat from the B\u00e9arn.[6] Although onions were plentiful and affordable by the poor,[1] a medieval recipe in Le M\u00e9nagier de Paris, published in 1393, includes among its ingredients ginger and saffron \u2013 rare and expensive spices \u2013 making this version of the dish one for wealthy households.[7] In his Le cuisinier fran\u00e7ois, published in 1680, Fran\u00e7ois Pierre de la Varenne offered two recipes for onion soup, in the first of which the onions are cooked in oil or butter and then simmered in water and meat broth. Hard-boiled egg yolks are added, and the finished soup is passed through a sieve.[8] According to Alexandre Dumas in his Grand dictionnaire de cuisine (1873), onion soup was introduced to the royal court at Versailles in the 18th century after Louis XV's father-in-law, the exiled Polish King Stanislas, enjoyed it at an inn and insisted on learning the recipe. As reported by Dumas, it consisted of three main ingredients: fried onions, water and croutons.[9] A recipe in the  Dictionnaire des alimens, vins et liqueurs, published during Louis XV's reign, is similar, but adds \"a spoonful of good lean broth\" before serving. None of these recipes call for grated cheese or gratinating.[n 2] A dining club called the \"D\u00eener de la soupe \u00e0 l'oignon\" was founded in Paris in the 1810s. Its twenty members all aspired to \u2013 and eventually did \u2013 become members of the Acad\u00e9mie fran\u00e7aise. They met every three months, and every dinner began with onion soup.[11] The modern version of French onion soup dates from the mid-19th century, in Les Halles, the large open-air market in Paris. The restaurants around the market \u2013 La Poule au Pot, Chez Baratte, Au Pied de Cochon \u2013 served the soup with a substantial topping of grated cheese, put under a grill and served au gratin.[7] According to one writer, the classic gratin\u00e9e des Halles transcended class distinctions: In Britain, a recipe for French onion soup was printed in The Cook and Housewife's Manual, published in Edinburgh in 1827. It is similar to the modern version, with the onions gently cooked and then simmered in veal stock.[12] The dish was introduced to the United States in 1861 at the New York restaurant of Henri Mouquin.[13] More papers in Britain began giving recipes described as \"French onion soup\" in the 1880s, but the cooking liquid was either milk or water thickened with flour, and no cheese, crouton or gratinating was specified.[14] In the first half of the 20th century onion soup bars became popular in London, around Piccadilly Circus, staying open all night to sell onion soup to late-night party-goers.[15] Recipes for onion soup vary greatly. Gently cooking sliced onions in butter or oil until softened and golden is the norm, but cooks differ about the cooking liquid. Beef stock is the most popular,[n 3] but some cooks specify chicken or veal stock or plain water.[n 4] Many cooks add alcohol to the cooking liquid, in the form of white wine, cider, calvados or brandy.[17] The cheese for the gratin is usually Gruy\u00e8re, Comt\u00e9 or Emmental.[17] Elizabeth David wrote in French Provincial Cooking, \"The onion soup generally regarded as 'French', with sodden bread, strings of cheese, and half-cooked onion floating about in it, seems to me a good deal overrated and rather indigestible\"; she suggested instead another French onion soup, \"Tourin Bordelais\", in which the onions are gently softened in lard and then cooked in water, with egg yolks added before serving to enrich the soup.[23] The gratin\u00e9e lyonnaise, originating in the restaurants of Lyon, is a more luxurious version of the basic soupe \u00e0 l'oignon, enriched with wine, bread, eggs and gratin\u00e9ed cheese.[7] Another French onion soup is velout\u00e9 Soubise, in which pur\u00e9ed onions are blended with veal stock, enriched with cream and egg yolks and served with croutons.[24] In America, mozzarella cheese is sometimes used as a variant.[25] Hot", "Tiramisu": " Tiramisu (Italian: tiramis\u00f9) is an Italian dessert made of ladyfinger pastries (savoiardi) dipped in coffee, layered with a whipped mixture of eggs, sugar, and mascarpone and flavoured with cocoa. The recipe has been adapted into many varieties of cakes and other desserts.[1][2] Its origin is disputed between the Italian regions of Veneto and Friuli-Venezia Giulia. The name comes from the Italian tirami su (lit.\u2009'pick me up'  or 'cheer me up').[3] Tiramisu appears to have been invented in the late 1960s or early 1970s, but where and when exactly is unclear.[4][5] Some believe the recipe was modeled after sbatudin, a simpler dessert made of egg yolks and sugar.[6] Others argue it originated from another dish, dolce Torino.[7] The tiramisu recipe is not found in cookbooks before the 1960s.[8][9][10] It is mentioned in a Sydney Morning Herald restaurant column published in 1978.[11] It is not mentioned in encyclopaedias and dictionaries of the 1970s,[12][13][14] first appearing in an Italian dictionary in 1980,[15] and in English in 1982.[16] It is mentioned in a 1983 cookbook devoted to cooking of the Veneto region.[17] Obituaries for the restaurateur Ado Campeol (1928\u20132021) reported that it was invented at his restaurant Le Beccherie in Treviso on 24 December 1969 by his wife Alba di Pillo (1929\u20132021) and the pastry chef Roberto Linguanotto (1943\u20132024).[18][19][20] The dish was added to its menu in 1972.[21][22][23] According to Carminantonio Iannaccone, he created the tiramisu at his bakery, Le Beccherie, on 24 December 1969.[24] It has been claimed that tiramisu has aphrodisiac effects and was concocted by a 19th century Treviso brothel madam, as the Accademia Del Tiramis\u00f9 explains, to \"solve the problems they may have had with their conjugal duties on their return to their wives\".[20][25] There is evidence of a tiremes\u00f9 semi-frozen dessert served by the Vetturino restaurant in Pieris, in the Friuli-Venezia Giulia region, since 1938.[26] This may be the name's origin, while the recipe for tiramisu may have originated as a variation of another layered dessert, zuppa inglese.[27] Others claim it was created towards the end of the 17th century in Siena in honour of Grand Duke Cosimo III.[28] On 29 July 2017, tiramisu was entered by the Ministry of Agricultural, Food and Forestry Policies on the list of traditional Friulian and Giulian agri-food products in the Friuli-Venezia Giulia region.[29][30] In 2013, Luca Zaia, President of Veneto, sought European Union protected status certification for the dessert, based on the ingredients used in 1970, so substitute ingredients, such as strawberries, could not be used in a dish called tiramisu.[31][32][33] Traditional tiramisu contains ladyfingers (savoiardi), egg yolks, sugar, coffee, mascarpone, and cocoa powder. A common variant involves soaking the savoiardi in alcohol, such as Marsala wine, amaretto or a coffee-based liqueur. The original tiramisu made at Le Beccherie was circular.[34] The original shape of the cake is round, although the shape of the biscuits also allows the use of a rectangular or square pan. However, it is often assembled in round glasses, which show the various layers, or pyramids. Modern versions can have the addition of whipped cream or whipped egg whites, or both, combined with mascarpone. This makes the dish lighter, thick and foamy. Among the most common alcoholic changes includes the addition of Marsala wine. The cake is usually eaten cold.[35] Another variation involves the preparation of the cream with eggs heated to sterilize it, but not so much that the eggs scramble. Over time, replacing some of the ingredients, mainly coffee, there arose numerous variants such as tiramisu with chocolate, amaretto, berry, lemon, strawberry, pineapple, yoghurt, banana, raspberry, and coconut. Numerous variations of tiramisu exist. Some cooks use other cakes or sweet, yeasted bread, such as panettone, in place of ladyfingers (savoiardi).[36] Bakers living in different Italian regions often debate the use and structural qualities of utilising other types of cookies, such as pavesini for instance, in the recipe.[37] Other cheese mixtures are used as well, some containing raw eggs, and others containing no eggs at all. Marsala wine can be added to the recipe, but other liquors are frequently substituted for it in both the coffee and the cheese mixture, including dark rum, Madeira, port, brandy, Malibu or Irish cream and especially coffee-flavoured liqueurs such as Tia Maria and Kahl\u00faa.[38] Amaretto liqueurs, such as Disaronno, are also often used to enhance the taste of tiramisu.[citation needed] Tiramisu is similar to other desserts, in particular with the Charlotte, in some versions composed of a Bavarian cream surrounded by a crown of ladyfingers and covered by a sweet cream; the Turin cake (dolce Torino), consisting of ladyfingers soaked in rosolio and alchermes with a spread made of butter, egg yolks, sugar, milk, and dark chocolate; and the bavarese lombarda, which is a similar composition of ladyfingers and egg yolks (albeit cooked ones). In bavarese, butter and rosolio (or alchermes) are also used, but not mascarpone cream or coffee.[citation needed] Media related to Tiramisu at Wikimedia Commons Cold", "Panna Cotta": "Panna cotta (lit.\u2009'cooked cream') is an Italian dessert of sweetened cream thickened with gelatin and molded. The cream may be aromatized with coffee, vanilla, or other flavorings.[1] The name panna cotta is not mentioned in Italian cookbooks before the 1960s,[2][3] yet it is often cited as a traditional dessert of the northern Italian region of Piedmont.[4][5] One unverified story says that it was invented by a Hungarian woman in the Langhe in the early 19th century.[6] An 1879 dictionary mentions a dish called latte inglese (lit.\u2009'English milk'), made of cream cooked with gelatin and molded,[7] although other sources say that latte inglese is made with egg yolks, such as cr\u00e8me anglaise;[8] perhaps the name covered any thickened custard-like preparation. The dish might also come from the French recipe of fromage bavarois from Marie-Antoine Car\u00eame in le p\u00e2tissier royal parisien, which is the same as the modern panna cotta, except that one part of the cream is whipped to make chantilly and included in the preparation before adding the gelatin.[9] The Piedmont region includes panna cotta in its 2001 list of traditional food products.[10] Its recipe includes cream, milk, sugar, vanilla, gelatin, rum, and marsala poured into a mold with caramel.[11] Another author considers the traditional flavoring to be peach eau de vie, and the traditional presentation not to have sauce or other garnishes.[12] Panna cotta became fashionable in the United States in the 1990s.[13][14] Sugar is dissolved in warm cream. The cream may be flavored by infusing spices and the like in it or by adding rum, coffee, vanilla, and so on. Gelatin is dissolved in a cold liquid (usually water), then added to the warm cream mixture. This is poured into molds and allowed to set.[2] The molds may have caramel in the bottoms, giving a result similar to a cr\u00e8me caramel.[15][16] After it solidifies, the panna cotta is usually unmolded onto a serving plate. Although the name means 'cooked cream',[17][16] the ingredients are only warm enough to dissolve the gelatin and sugar.[3] Italian recipes sometimes call for colla di pesce ('fish glue'), which may literally be isinglass or, more probably, simply a name for common gelatin. Panna cotta is often served with a coulis of berries or a sauce of caramel or chocolate. It may be covered with other fruits[18] or liqueurs.[2] Bavarian cream is similar to panna cotta but usually includes eggs as well as gelatin and is mixed with whipped cream before setting.[19] Blancmange is sometimes thickened with gelatin or isinglass, and sometimes with cornstarch.[20] Panna cotta is sometimes called a custard,[3] but true custard is thickened with egg yolks, not gelatin. A lighter version substitutes cream with Greek yogurt.[16] Media related to Panna cotta at Wikimedia Commons\n Panna Cotta with Red Fruit Sauce at the Wikibooks Cookbook subproject", "Creme Brulee": " Cr\u00e8me br\u00fbl\u00e9e or cr\u00e8me brul\u00e9e (/\u02cckr\u025bm bru\u02d0\u02c8le\u026a/; French: [k\u0281\u025bm b\u0281y.le]), also known as burnt cream or Trinity cream,[1] and virtually identical to crema catalana,[2] is a dessert consisting of a rich custard base topped with a layer of hardened caramelized sugar. It is normally served slightly chilled; the heat from the caramelizing process tends to warm the top of the custard, while leaving the center cool. The custard base is generally flavored with vanilla in French cuisine, but can have other flavorings. It is sometimes garnished with fruit. The earliest known recipe of a dessert called cr\u00e8me br\u00fbl\u00e9e appears in Fran\u00e7ois Massialot's 1691 cookbook Cuisinier royal et bourgeois,[3][4] but its ultimate origins are unclear.[5] The recipe is based on egg yolks and milk, with a pinch of flour. Once cooked, Fran\u00e7ois Massialot specifies \"that it must be sweetened on top, in addition to the sugar that is put in it: we take the shovel from the fire, very red at the same time we burn the cream, so that it takes a beautiful color of gold\". Some authors mention Bartolomeo Stefani's Latte alla Spagnuola (1662) as describing crema catalana,[5] but it calls for browning the top of the custard before serving with sugar on top.[6] The practice of browning dishes with a hot iron was already documented in La Varenne's Cuisinier fran\u00e7ois, published in 1651.[7] La Varenne applies the process to his Oeufs au laict [sic] 'eggs with milk', Oeufs \u00e0 la cr\u00e8me 'eggs with cream', as well as non-custard dishes such as oeufs au miroir de cresme 'fried eggs in cream', ramequin de fromage 'cheese toast', and ramequin de roignon 'kidney ramequin'.[7] But none of these had a layer of hard caramel on top. The name \"burnt cream\" was later used to refer to the dish in the 1702 English translation of Massialot's Cuisinier royal et bourgeois.[8] In 1740, he referred to a similar recipe as cr\u00eame \u00e0 l'Angloise, or 'English cream', which further cast doubt on its origins. The dessert was introduced at Trinity College, Cambridge in 1879 as \"Trinity Cream\" or \"Cambridge burnt cream\", with the college arms \"impressed on top of the cream with a branding iron\".[1] No dessert by the name cr\u00e8me br\u00fbl\u00e9e appeared again in French cookbooks until the 1980s.[3] Cr\u00e8me br\u00fbl\u00e9e was generally uncommon in both French and English cookbooks of the nineteenth and twentieth centuries.[3] It became extremely popular in the 1980s, \"a symbol of that decade's self-indulgence and the darling of the restaurant boom\",[2][9] probably popularised by Sirio Maccioni at his New York restaurant Le Cirque. He claimed to have made it \"the most famous and by far the most popular dessert in restaurants from Paris to Peoria\". It also spread from France to other parts in Asia.[3][10] Cr\u00e8me br\u00fbl\u00e9e is usually served in individual ramekins. Discs of caramel may be prepared separately and put on top just before serving, or the caramel may be formed directly on top of the custard immediately before serving. To do this, sugar is sprinkled onto the custard, then caramelized under a red-hot salamander (a cast-iron disk with a long wooden handle) or with a butane torch.[11] There are two methods for making the custard. The more common creates a \"hot\" custard by whisking egg yolks in a double boiler with sugar and incorporating the cream, adding vanilla once the custard is removed from the heat.[12] Alternatively, the egg yolk/sugar mixture can be tempered with hot cream, then adding vanilla at the end. In the \"cold\" method, the egg yolks and sugar are whisked together until the mixture reaches the ribbon stage. Then, cold heavy cream is whisked into the yolk mixture, followed by the vanilla. It is then poured into ramekins and baked in a bain-marie.[13] Room temperature", "Mochi": "Mochi (\u3082\u3061, \u9905) [mot\u0255i] \u24d8 is a Japanese rice cake made of mochigome (\u3082\u3061\u7c73), a short-grain japonica glutinous rice, and sometimes other ingredients such as water, sugar, and cornstarch. The steamed rice is pounded into paste and molded into the desired shape. In Japan, it is traditionally made in a ceremony called mochitsuki (\u9905\u6417\u304d).[1] While eaten year-round, mochi is a traditional food for the Japanese New Year, and is commonly sold and eaten during that time. Mochi is a multicomponent food consisting of polysaccharides, lipids, protein, and water. Mochi has a heterogeneous structure of amylopectin gel, starch grains, and air bubbles.[2] The rice used for mochi has a negligible amylose content and a high amylopectin level, producing a gel-like consistency.[3] The protein content of the japonica rice used to make mochi is higher than that of standard short-grain rice. Mochi is similar to dango, which is made with rice flour instead of pounded rice grains.[4] Red rice was the original variant used in the production of mochi.[5]\nThe cultural significance of mochi in Japan is unique, though it has elements in common with other auspicious foods in other Asian countries.[6] According to archaeological research, the homemade production of mochi increased beginning in the 6th century (Kofun period), when earthenware steamers became popular in every household, mainly in eastern Japan.[7]:\u200a267 In the Bungo no kuni fudoki, compiled in the late 8th century in the Nara period, a legend concerning mochi was described. According to the book, when a rich man made a flat mochi from leftover rice and shot an arrow at it, the mochi transformed into a white bird and flew away, and after that, the man's rice field became desolate and barren. This legend shows that round white mochi was historically held to have spiritual power.[8] In the Heian period (794\u20131185), mochi was often used in Shinto events to celebrate childbirth and marriage. According to the \u014ckagami compiled in the 12th century, emperors and nobilities used to put mochi into the mouths of babies that were 50 days old.[9]:\u200a30\u200a In this period, it became customary in the aristocratic society for the bride and groom to eat mochi together at the bride's house three days after the wedding.[10] The first recorded accounts of mochi being used as a part of New Year's festivities are from the Heian period. The nobles of the Imperial court believed that long strands of freshly made mochi symbolized long life and well-being, while dried mochi helped strengthen one's teeth. Accounts of it can also be found in The Tale of Genji.[11] The custom of kagami mochi (mirror mochi) began among the samurai class during the Muromachi period. Kagami mochi are composed of two spheres of mochi stacked on top of one another, topped with a bitter orange (daidai). In welcoming the New Year, samurai decorated kagami mochi with Japanese armour and Japanese swords and would place them in the tokonoma (alcove in a traditional Japanese room where art or flowers are displayed) to pray for the prosperity of their families in the New Year. When people ate kagami mochi after the New Year period, they avoided cutting it with a h\u014dch\u014d (knife) so as not to violate the kami, and smashed it with a wooden hammer after it naturally dried and cracked.[12] Mochi continues to be one of the traditional foods eaten around Japanese New Year and is sold and consumed in abundance around this time. A kagami mochi is placed on family altars (kamidana) on December 28 each year.[13] The cherry blossom (sakura) is a symbol of Japan and signifies the onset of full-fledged spring. Sakuramochi is a pink-coloured mochi surrounding sweet red bean paste and wrapped in an edible, salted cherry blossom leaf; this dish is usually made during the spring.[15] Children's Day is celebrated in Japan on May 5. On this day, the Japanese promote the happiness and well-being of children. Kashiwa-mochi and chimaki are made especially for this celebration.[15] Kashiwa-mochi is white mochi surrounding a sweet red bean paste filling with a kashiwa oak leaf wrapped around it.[15]\nChimaki is a variation of a dango wrapped in bamboo leaves.[15] Hishi mochi is a ceremonial dessert presented as a ritual offering on the days leading up to Hinamatsuri, or \"Girls' Day\" in Japan, on March 3 every year. Hishi mochi is rhomboid-shaped mochi with layers of red, green, and white. The three layers are coloured with jasmine flowers, water caltrop, and mugwort.[16] Traditionally, mochi making is an important cultural event in Japan that involves members of a local community or family. Although less common today, the traditional process still exists in most rural areas, as well as in urban temples, shrines, and community spaces, especially in the days leading up to the new year.[17][18] The traditional process of mochi-pounding (called mochitsuki (\u9905\u3064\u304d)) involves whole rice as the only ingredient and takes place in three basic steps: The modern preparation of mochi uses a sweet flour of sweet rice (mochiko). The flour is mixed with water and cooked on a stovetop or in the microwave until it forms a sticky, opaque, white mass.[21] This process is performed twice, stirring the mass in between[22] until it becomes malleable and slightly transparent.[23] With modern equipment, mochi can be made at home, with the technology automating the laborious dough pounding.[22] Household mochi appliances provide a suitable space where the environment of the dough can be controlled. The assembly-line sections in mochi production control these aspects: Varieties of glutinous and waxy rice are produced as major raw material for mochi. The rice is chosen for tensile strength and compressibility. One study found that in kantomochi rice 172 and BC3, amylopectin distribution varied and affected the hardness of mochi. Kantomochi rice produced harder, brittle, grainy textures, all undesirable qualities except for ease of cutting.[24] For mass production, the rice variety should be chewy, but easy to separate. Generally, two types of machines are used for mochi production in an assembly line. One machine prepares the dough, while the other forms the dough into consistent shapes, unfilled or with filling. The first type of machine controls the temperature at which the rice gelatinizes. One study found that a temperature of 62\u00a0\u00b0C (144\u00a0\u00b0F) corresponds to the gelatinization of mochi. When the temperature fell below this point, the hardening was too slow. It was concluded that a processing temperature below 62\u00a0\u00b0C (144\u00a0\u00b0F) was unsuitable for dough preparation.[25] Mochi is a variation of a low-calorie, low-fat rice cake. The cake has two essential raw materials, rice and water. Sticky rice (also called sweet rice, Oryza sativa var. glutinosa, glutinous sticky rice, glutinous rice, waxy rice, botan rice, biroin chal, mochi rice, pearl rice, and pulut),[26] whether brown or white, is best for mochi-making, as long-grain varieties will not expand perfectly. Water is essential in the early stages of preparation. Other additives such as salt and other seasonings and flavourings are important for nutritive value and taste. However, additives can cause breakage of the mass, so should not be added to the rice before the cake is formed. The balls of rice are then flattened and cut into pieces or shaped into rounds.[20] The machines for mass production are a hugely expensive investment, and the product should have the proper moisture, to appeal to consumers.[citation needed] While mochi can be refrigerated for a short storage period,[27] it can also \"become hard and not usable.\"[28] The recommended preservation method is by freezing. The best method for freezing involves wrapping each mochi cake tightly in a sealed plastic bag. Although mochi can be kept in a freezer for almost one year, the frozen mochi may lose flavor and softness or get freezer-burned.[27] Food additives, such as modified tapioca starch, can also extend the shelf life of mochi.[29] Mochi is relatively simple to make, as only a few ingredients are needed for plain mochi. The main ingredient is either shiratamako or mochiko, Japanese sweet glutinous rice flours. [inconsistent] Both shiratamako and mochiko are made from mochigome, a type of glutinous short-grain rice. The difference between shiratamako and mochiko comes from texture and processing methods. Shiratamako flour has been more refined and is a finer flour with a smoother, more elastic feel.[30] Mochiko is less refined and has a doughier texture. Other ingredients may include water, sugar, and cornstarch (to prevent sticking).[31] Additional other ingredients can be added to create different variations/flavors.[citation needed] Mochi is gluten- and cholesterol-free, as it is made from rice flour. A single serving of 44.0\u00a0g (1.55\u00a0oz) has 96 calories (kilocalories), 1.0\u00a0g (0.035\u00a0oz) of fat, but no trans or saturated fat, 1.0\u00a0mg (0.015\u00a0gr) of sodium, 22.0\u00a0g (0.78\u00a0oz) of carbohydrates, no dietary fiber, 6.0\u00a0g (0.21\u00a0oz) of sugar, and 1.0\u00a0g (0.035\u00a0oz) of protein.[32] Amylose and amylopectin are both components of starch and polysaccharides made from D-glucose units. The big difference between the two is that amylose is linear because it only has \u03b1lpha-1,4-glycosidic bonds. Amylopectin, though, is a branched polysaccharide because it has \u03b1lpha-1,4-glycosidic bonds with occasional \u03b1lpha-1,6-glycosidic bonds[33] around every 22 D-glucose units.[34] Glutinous rice is nearly 100%[35] composed of amylopectin and almost completely lacks its counterpart, amylose, in its starch granules. A nonglutinous rice grain contains amylose at about 10\u201330% weight by weight and amylopectin at about 70\u201390% weight by weight.[33] Glutinous or waxy type of starches occur in maize, sorghum, wheat, and rice. An interesting characteristic of glutinous rice is that it stains red when iodine is added, whereas nonglutinous rice stains blue.[35] This phenomenon occurs when iodine is mixed with iodide to form tri-iodide and penta-iodide. Penta-iodide intercalates between the starch molecules and stains amylose and amylopectin blue and red, respectively.[36] The gelation and viscous texture of glutinous rice is due to amylopectin being more hygroscopic[37] than amylose, thus water enters the starch granule, causing it to swell, while the amylose leaves the starch granule and becomes part of a colloidal solution.[38] In other words, the higher the amylopectin content, the higher the swelling of the starch granule.[39] Though the amylopectin content plays a major role in the defined characteristic of viscosity in glutinous rice, factors such as heat also play a very important role in the swelling, since it enhances the uptake of water into the starch granule significantly.[40] The high amylopectin content of waxy or glutinous starches is genetically controlled by the waxy or wax gene. Its quality of greater viscosity and gelation is dependent on the distribution of the amylopectin unit chains.[33] Grains that have this gene are considered mutants, which explains why most of them are selectively bred to create a grain that is close to having or has a 0% amylose content.[35] The table below summarizes the amylose and amylopectin content of different starches, waxy and nonwaxy: The soaking of the glutinous rice is an elemental step in the preparation of mochi, either traditionally or industrially. During this process, glutinous rice decreases in protein content as it is soaked in water. The chemicals that make up the flavour of plain or \"natural\" mochi are ethyl acetate, ethanol, 2-butanol, 2 methyl 1-propanol, 1-butanol, isoamyl alcohol, 1-pentanol and propane acid.[42] Mochi is usually composed solely of glutinous rice, however, some variations may include the additions of salt, spices and flavourings such as cinnamon (cinnamaldehyde).[43] Food additives such as sucrose, sorbitol or glycerol may be added to increase viscosity and therefore increase gelatinization. Additives that slow down retrogradation are not usually added since amylopectin has a very stable shelf life due to its high amylopectin content.[44] Mochi's characteristic chewiness is due to the polysaccharides in it. The viscosity and elasticity that account for this chewiness are affected by many factors such as the starch concentration, configuration of the swollen starch granules, the conditions of heating (temperature, heating period and rate of heating) as well as the junction zones that interconnect each polymer chain. The more junction zones the substance has, the stronger the cohesiveness of the gel, thereby forming a more solid-like material. The perfect mochi has the perfect balance between viscosity and elasticity so that it is not inextensible and fragile but rather extensible yet firm.[45] Many tests have been conducted on the factors that affect the viscoelastic properties of mochi. As puncture tests show, samples with a higher solid (polysaccharide) content show an increased resistance and thereby a stronger and tougher gel. This increased resistance to the puncture test indicate that an increase in solute concentration leads to a more rigid and harder gel with an increased cohesiveness, internal binding, elasticity and springiness which means a decrease in material flow or an increase in viscosity. These results can also be brought about by an increase in heating time. Sensory assessments of the hardness, stickiness and elasticity of mochi and their relationship with solute concentration and heating time were performed. Similar to the puncture test results, sensory tests determine that hardness and elasticity increase with increasing time of heating and solid concentration. However, stickiness of the samples increase with increasing time of heating and solid concentration until a certain level, above which the reverse is observed. These relationships are important because too hard or elastic a mochi is undesirable, as is one that is too sticky and will stick to walls of the container.[45] Suffocation deaths are caused by mochi every year in Japan, especially among elderly people.[46][47][48] In 2015, it was reported that according to the Tokyo Fire Department \u2013 which responds to choking cases \u2013 more than 100 people were hospitalised per year for choking on mochi in Tokyo alone. Also in Tokyo, between 2006 and 2009 there were 18 reported deaths resulting from choking on mochi. As a result of this risk, Japanese authorities put out yearly warnings, advising people to cut mochi into small pieces before consumption.[46] Mochi may be eaten alone as a major component of a main meal, and is used as an ingredient in other prepared foods. Many types of traditional wagashi and mochigashi (Japanese traditional sweets) are made with mochi. For example, daifuku is a soft round mochi stuffed with sweet filling, such as sweetened red bean paste (anko) or white bean paste (shiro an).[49] Ichigo daifuku is a version containing a whole strawberry inside.[50] Kusa mochi is a green variety of mochi flavored with mugwort (yomogi).[51][49] When daifuku is made with kusa mochi, it is called yomogi daifuku.[52][53] Small balls of ice cream are wrapped inside a mochi covering to make mochi ice cream. In Japan, this is manufactured by the conglomerate Lotte under the name Yukimi Daifuku, \"snow-viewing daifuku\". In Taiwan, a traditional Hakka and Hoklo pounded rice cake was called tauchi (Chinese: \u8c46\u7ccd; Pe\u030dh-\u014de-j\u012b: t\u0101u-ch\u00ee) and came in various styles and forms just like in Japan. Traditional Hakka tauchi is served as glutinous rice dough, covered with peanut or sesame powder. Not until the Japanese era was Japanese-style mochi introduced and gained popularity. Nowadays, Taiwanese mochi often comes with bean paste fillings. In China, tangyuan is made from glutinous rice flour mixed with a small amount of water to form balls and is then cooked and served in boiling water. Tangyuan is typically filled with black sesame paste or peanut paste and served in the water that it was boiled in. In Hong Kong and other Cantonese regions, the traditional Lo Mai Chi (Chinese: \u7cef\u7c73\u7ccd; Jyutping: no6 mai5 ci4) is made of glutinous rice flour in the shape of a ball, with fillings such as crushed peanuts, coconut, red bean paste, and black sesame paste. It can come in a variety of modern flavors such as green tea, mango, taro, strawberry, and more. In Philippines, a traditional Filipino sweet snack similar to Japanese mochi is called tikoy (Chinese: \u751c\u7cbf; Pe\u030dh-\u014de-j\u012b: ti\u207f-k\u00f3e). There is also another delicacy called espasol with a taste similar to Japanese kinako mochi, though made with roasted rice flour (not kinako, roasted soy flour). The Philippines also has several steamed rice snacks with very similar names to mochi, including moche, mache, and masi. These are small steamed rice balls with bean paste or peanut fillings. However they are not derived from the Japanese mochi, but are derivatives of the Chinese jian dui (called buchi in the Philippines). They are also made with the native galapong process, which mixes ground slightly fermented cooked glutinous rice with coconut milk. In Korea, chapssal-tteok (Hangul: \ucc39\uc300\ub5a1) varieties are made of steamed glutinous rice or steamed glutinous rice flour. In Indonesia, kue moci is usually filled with sweet bean paste and covered with sesame seeds. Kue moci comes from Sukabumi, West Java and Semarang, Central Java.[65] Another Indonesian mochi is yangko, a Yogyakarta mochi made from glutinuous rice.[66] In Pontianak, mochi is covered with ground peanut powder and the dish named kaloci.[67] In Malaysia, kuih kochi is made from glutinous rice flour and filled with coconut filling and palm sugar. Another Chinese Malaysian variant, loh mai chi is made with same ingredients but their fillings are filled with crushed peanuts.[68] There is also kuih tepung gomak\u00a0[ms], which has similar ingredients and texture to mochi but larger in size. The snack is quite popular in the east coast of Malaysia.[69][70] In Singapore, muah chee is made from glutinous rice flour and is usually coated with either crushed peanuts or black sesame seeds.[71] In Taiwan, a soft version similar to daifuku is called moachi (Chinese: \u9ebb\u7ccd; Pe\u030dh-\u014de-j\u012b: mo\u00e2-ch\u00ee) in Taiwanese Hokkien and mashu (Chinese: \u9ebb\u7cec; pinyin: m\u00e1sh\u01d4) in Taiwanese Mandarin. In Hawaii, a dessert variety called \"butter mochi\" is made with mochiko, butter, sugar, coconut, and other ingredients then baked to make a sponge cake of sorts.[72][73] Similar foods in other countries:", "Baklava": "Baklava (/b\u0251\u02d0kl\u0259\u02c8v\u0251\u02d0, \u02c8b\u0251\u02d0kl\u0259v\u0251\u02d0/,[1] or /b\u0259\u02c8kl\u0251\u02d0v\u0259/;[2] Ottoman Turkish: \u0628\u0627\u0642\u0644\u0648\u0627 listen\u24d8) is a layered pastry dessert made of filo pastry, filled with chopped nuts, and sweetened with syrup or honey. It was one of the most popular sweet pastries of Ottoman cuisine.[3] There are several theories for the origin of the pre-Ottoman version of the dish. In modern times, it is a common dessert among cuisines of countries in West Asia, Southeast Europe, Central Asia, and North Africa. The word baklava is first attested in English in 1650,[4] a borrowing from Ottoman Turkish: \u0628\u0627\u0642\u0644\u0627\u0648\u0647 /b\u0251\u02d0kl\u0251v\u0251\u02d0/.[5][6] The name baklava is used in many languages with minor phonetic and spelling variations. The earliest known reference to baklava is in a poem by the 15th century mystic Kaygusuz Abdal.[7] The historian Paul D. Buell argues that the word baklava may come from the Mongolian root ba\u03b3la- 'to tie, wrap up, pile up' composed with the Turkic verbal ending -v;[8] ba\u03b3la- itself in Mongolian is a Turkic loanword.[9] The lexicographer Sevan Ni\u015fanyan considers its oldest known forms (pre-1500) to be bakla\u011f\u0131 and bakla\u011fu, and labels it as being of Proto-Turkic origin.[10] Another form of the word is also recorded in Persian, \u0628\u0627\u0642\u0644\u0628\u0627 (b\u0101qlab\u0101).[11] Though the suffix -v\u0101 might suggest a Persian origin,[12][13] the baqla- part does not appear to be Persian and remains of unknown origin.[14] The linguist Tuncer G\u00fclensoy states that the origin of baklava is bakl-\u0131 (feed) in proto-Turkish and suffixes -la-\u011f\u0131 are added. The word changes as bak\u0131la\u011f\u0131 > bak\u0131lav\u0131 > baklava.[15] The Arabic name \u0628\u0642\u0644\u0627\u0648\u0629 baql\u0101wa originates from Turkish.[16] The three main proposals for the roots of baklava are the Greek placenta cake,[17] the Medieval Persian (Iranian) lauzinaj,[18] and the Central Asian Turkic tradition of layered breads.[19] There are also claims attributing baklava to the Assyrians, according to which baklava was prepared by them in the 8th century BC.[20] There are also some similarities between baklava and the Ancient Greek desserts gastris (\u03b3\u03ac\u03c3\u03c4\u03c1\u03b9\u03c2),[21] kopte sesamis (\u03ba\u03bf\u03c0\u03c4\u1f74 \u03c3\u03b7\u03c3\u03b1\u03bc\u03af\u03c2), and kopton (\u03ba\u03bf\u03c0\u03c4\u03cc\u03bd) found in book XIV of the Deipnosophistae.[22][23] However, the recipe there is for a filling of nuts and honey, with a top and bottom layer of honey and ground sesame similar to modern pasteli or halva, and no dough, certainly not a flaky dough.[24] Another recipe for a similar dessert is g\u00fclla\u00e7, a dessert found in Turkish cuisine and considered by some as the origin of baklava.[25] It consists of layers of filo dough that are put one by one in warmed up milk with sugar. It is served with walnut and fresh pomegranate and generally eaten during Ramadan. The first known documentation of g\u00fclla\u00e7 is attested in a food and health manual, written in 1330 that documents Mongol foods called Yinshan Zhengyao (\u98ee\u81b3\u6b63\u8981, Important Principles of Food and Drink), written by Hu Sihui, an ethnic Mongol court dietitian of the Yuan dynasty.[8] Although the history of baklava is not well documented, its Turkish version was probably developed in the imperial kitchens of the Topkap\u0131 Palace in Constantinople (modern Istanbul).[19][26] The Sultan presented trays of baklava to the Janissaries every 15th of the month of Ramadan in a ceremonial procession called the Baklava Alay\u0131.[18][27][28] Many claim that the placenta cake, and therefore likely baklava, derived from a recipe from Ancient Greece.[29] Homer's Odyssey, written around 800 BC, mentions thin breads sweetened with walnuts and honey.[29] In the fifth century BC, Philoxenos states in his poem \"Dinner\" that, in the final drinking course of a meal, hosts would prepare and serve cheesecake made with milk and honey that was baked into a pie.[30] The word \"placenta\" originally comes from the Greek language plakous (\u03c0\u03bb\u03b1\u03ba\u03bf\u1fe6\u03c2), which means something \"flat and broad\".[31][32] An early Greek language mention of plakous as a dessert (or second table delicacy) comes from the poems of Archestratos. He describes plakous as served with nuts or dried fruits and commends the honey-drenched Athenian version of plakous.[33] Antiphanes, a contemporary of Archestratos, provided an ornate description of plakous:[33][34] The streams of the tawny bee, mixed with the curdled river of bleating she-goats, placed upon a flat receptacle of the virgin daughter of Demeter [honey, cheese, flour], delighting in ten thousand delicate toppings \u2013 or shall I simply say plakous? I'm for plakous. In the Byzantine Empire, the traditional placenta cake (known as \"koptoplakous\", \u03ba\u03bf\u03c0\u03c4\u03bf\u03c0\u03bb\u03b1\u03ba\u03bf\u1fe6\u03c2), a dish similar to baklava, was consumed.[36][37][38] The earliest known detailed recipe for placenta, from the 2nd century BC, is a honey-covered baked layered-dough dessert which food historian Patrick Faas identifies as the origin of baklava.[17][39] Historian Andrew Dalby speculates as to why Cato's section on bread and cakes, which he describes as \"recipes in a Greek tradition\", are included in De Agricultura: \"Possibly Cato included them so that the owner and guests might be entertained when visiting the farm; possibly so that proper offerings might be made to the gods; more likely, I believe, so that profitable sales might be made at a neighbouring market.\"[40] Cato's original recipe for placenta follows: Shape the placenta as follows: place a single row of tracta along the whole length of the base dough. This is then covered with the mixture [cheese and honey] from the mortar. Place another row of tracta on top and go on doing so until all the cheese and honey have been used up. Finish with a layer of tracta. ... place the placenta in the oven and put a preheated lid on top of it ... When ready, honey is poured over the placenta. According to a number of scholars, koptoplakous (\u03ba\u03bf\u03c0\u03c4\u03bf\u03c0\u03bb\u03b1\u03ba\u03bf\u1fe6\u03c2) was a precursor to the modern baklava.[17][41][42] Historian Speros Vryonis describes koptoplakous as a \"Byzantine favorite\" and \"the same as the Turkish baklava\",[43] as do other writers.[31] The name (Greek: \u03c0\u03bb\u03b1\u03c4\u03c3\u03ad\u03bd\u03c4\u03b1) is used today on the island of Lesbos for thin layered pastry leaves with crushed nuts, baked, and covered in syrup.[44][45] Baklava is a common dessert in modern Arab cuisines, but the Arabic language cookbook Kitab al-Tabikh, compiled by Ibn Sayyar al-Warraq in the 10th-century, does not contain any recipe for baklava.[46] Its recipe for lauzinaj refers to small pieces of almond paste wrapped in very thin pastry (\"as thin as grasshoppers' wings\") and drenched in syrup.[47] Some writers say this is dessert that most closely resembles the modern baklava.[48] Charles Perry, however, has written that \"it was not much like baklava\".[49] There are similar recipes for lauzinaj in the 13th-century Kitab al-Tabikh by Muhammad bin Hasan al-Baghdadi. Written in 1226 in today's Iraq, the cookbook was based on an earlier collection of 9th century Persian-inspired recipes.[18] According to Gil Marks, Middle Eastern pastry makers later developed the process of layering the ingredients.[18] Baklava is normally prepared in large pans. Many layers of filo dough,[50] separated with melted butter and vegetable oil, are laid in the pan. A layer of chopped nuts\u2014typically walnuts or pistachios, but hazelnuts and almonds are also sometimes used\u2014is placed on top, then more layers of filo. Most recipes have multiple layers of filo and nuts, though some have only top and bottom pastry. Before baking, the dough is cut into regular pieces, often parallelograms (lozenge-shaped), triangles, diamonds or rectangles. After baking, a syrup, which may include honey, rosewater, or orange flower water, is poured over the cooked baklava and allowed to soak. Baklava is usually served at room temperature, and is often garnished with ground nuts. Baklava in Algeria is called Baklawa (Arabic: \u0628\u0642\u0644\u0627\u0648\u0629, Tifinagh: \u2d31\u2d30\u2d3d\u2d4d\u2d30\u2d39\u2d30). In most Algerian regions, Baklava is the centerpiece of any sweets table. This type of Baklava originates in the Algerian city of Constantine. The Algerian Baklava is distinct in that filo dough is not used. Instead, they use another type of thin dough called malsouka or warqa and instead of walnuts or pistachios they use almonds.[51][52][53][54] Like other forms of baklava, the layered pastry is cut into diamond-shaped pieces and has one almond placed on top of each piece before being baked. It is then soaked in a syrup of honey, sugar, and lemon juice.[55][56][57] In Syrian cuisine, baklava (Arabic: \u0627\u0644\u0628\u0642\u0644\u0627\u0648\u0629, Syriac: \u0712\u0729\u0720\u0718\u0710) is a dessert mostly served on special occasions like Eid al-Fitr, or Syrian Christmas.[58] It is made of 24 layers of buttered phyllo dough, a filling of either chopped pistachios or chopped walnuts (walnuts are preferred) and a syrup consisting of sugar, orange blossom water, and lemon juice.[59] Syrian baklava comes in many shapes, but the diamond shape is the most common one.[60] A Syrian baklava recipe was introduced to the Turkish city of Gaziantep in 1871 by \u00c7elebi G\u00fcll\u00fc, who had learned the recipe from a chef in the city of Damascus which transformed into the Gaziantep baklava we know today.[61] Armenian baklava, known in Armenian as pakhlava (Armenian: \u0553\u0561\u056d\u056c\u0561\u057e\u0561) is made of layers of phyllo dough, a filling of cinnamon-spiced chopped walnuts, and a syrup made from cloves, cinnamon, lemon juice, sugar and water.[62][63] It is diamond-shaped and often has either one hazelnut, almond, or half a walnut placed on each piece.[64] It is often served at special occasions like Armenian Christmas or Armenian Easter.[65][66] Armenian baklava has some variations on how many phyllo layers are supposed to be used. One variation uses 40 sheets of dough to align with the 40 days of Lent Jesus spent in the desert where he fasted.[67][68][69] Another variation is similar to the Greek style of baklava, which is supposed to be made with 33 dough layers, referring to the years of Jesus's life.[70] The city of Gavar makes Its own version of baklava. It is made with 25 dough layers, has a filling of cleaned and dried chopped walnuts, sugar and a syrup that is poured over the finished baklava consisting of honey and flowers.[71][72] This type of baklava used to be prepared in the then-Armenian city of Bayazet, but the people living there immigrated to Gavar and surrounding regions in 1830.[73] Azerbaijani baklava (Azerbaijani: Az\u0259rbaycan paxlavas\u0131) is made mostly for special occasions (like Nowruz).[74][75][76] Pastry, cardamom, and saffron are used for the preparation. Nuts (mostly hazelnuts, almonds or walnuts) and sugar are used as the filling, and syrup is used as a sweetener.[77] Ethnic groups native to different regions (like Lezgins and Tat people) have contributed to some regional variations.[78][79][80] In Bosnian cuisine, Ru\u017eice is the name of the regional variant of baklava.[88] Baklava also exists in Romanian cuisine, being known as baclava in Romanian. It is one of the most preferred desserts among Romanians together with the Kanafeh (cataif) and the sarailia. In Romania, some Turkish pastry shops that sell baklava have notable popularity. They are common in the south and southeast of the country, but some also exist in its east.[89] In Bulgaria, baklava is very popular during the winter holiday season, when people have it for dessert after dinner. In Greek cuisine, walnuts are more common than pistachios, and the dessert is flavored with cinnamon. Greek baklava (Greek: \u039c\u03c0\u03b1\u03ba\u03bb\u03b1\u03b2\u03ac\u03c2) comes in many regional guises, with different names such as samousades, zournadakia, and masourakia. Generally speaking, in southern Greece baklava is mostly made with chopped almonds and in the north with walnuts. Some recipes use hazelnuts, sesame or raisins.[90] The syrup is made of sugar, honey, water, cinnamon and orange or lemon zest.[91][92] Greek baklava is supposed to be made with 33 filo dough layers, referring to the years of Jesus's life.[70] On the island of Lesbos in Greece a type of baklava is still known as placenta (Greek: \u03c0\u03bb\u03b1\u03c4\u03c3\u03ad\u03bd\u03c4\u03b1), which is the name of an Ancient Greek pastry that is often seen as the predecessor of baklava. The latter is a baked dessert with very thinly made pastry layers and chopped nuts. The base for this modern placenta is made with leaves of filo dough, and nuts stacked upon each other. After baking, it is soaked in a simple syrup and sprinkled with cinnamon.[93][94][95] Iranian baklava (Persian: \u0628\u0627\u0642\u0644\u0648\u0627) is less crisp and uses less syrup than other baklava variations.[96] The cities of Yazd, Tabriz, Qazvin, Kashan and the Gilan province are famous for their baklava variations, which are widely distributed in Iran.[97][98][99][100] Iranian baklava uses a combination of chopped almonds, hazelnuts or walnuts and pistachios spiced with saffron, cardamom or jasmine. For the syrup, rose water, lemon juice, sugar, honey, and water are used.[101][102] Iranian baklava may be cut into diamonds or squares.[103] When it is finished it is often garnished with chopped pistachios, rose petals, jasmine or coconut powder depending on the region.[104] In Turkish cuisine, baklava is traditionally filled with pistachios, walnuts or almonds (in some parts of the Aegean Region). In the Black Sea Region hazelnuts are commonly used as a filling for baklava.[105] Hazelnuts are also used as a filling for the Turkish dessert S\u00fctl\u00fc Nuriye, a lighter version of the dessert which substitutes milk for the simple syrup used in traditional baklava recipes.[106] \u015e\u00f6biyet is a variation that includes kaymak[107] as the filling, in addition to the traditional nuts.[108] The city of Gaziantep in south-central Turkey is famous for its baklava made from locally grown pistachios,[109] often served with kaymak cream. The dessert was introduced to Gaziantep in 1871 by \u00c7elebi G\u00fcll\u00fc, who had learned the recipe from a chef in Damascus.[110] In 2008, the Turkish patent office registered a geographical indication for Antep Baklava,[111] and in 2013, Antep Baklavas\u0131 or Gaziantep Baklavas\u0131 was registered as a Protected Geographical Indication by the European Commission.[112] Gaziantep baklava is the first Turkish product to receive a protected designation from the European Commission.[113] Uzbek cuisine has pakhlava, puskal or yupka or in Tatar yoka, which are sweet and salty savories (b\u00f6rekler) prepared with 10\u201312 layers of dough.[16] In Crimean Tatar cuisine, the pakhlava is their variant of baklava.[114] There are many variants in Maghrebi cuisine as well.[115] Cold, room temperature or re-warmed", "Dim Sum": " Dim sum (traditional Chinese: \u9ede\u5fc3; simplified Chinese: \u70b9\u5fc3; pinyin: di\u01cen x\u012bn; Jyutping: dim2 sam1) is a large range of small Chinese dishes that are traditionally enjoyed in restaurants for brunch,[1][2] with a \u201cselection of over 1,000 varieties of small-plate Chinese foods, usually meat or vegetables in dough or a wrapper that is steamed, deep-fried or pan-fried.\u201d[3] Most modern dim sum dishes are commonly associated with Cantonese cuisine, although dim sum dishes also exist in other Chinese cuisines. In the tenth century, when the city of Canton (Guangzhou) began to experience an increase in commercial travel,[4] many frequented teahouses for small-portion meals with tea called \"yum cha\" (brunch).[5][4][6] \"Yum cha\" includes two related concepts.[7] The first is \"jat zung loeng gin\" (Chinese: \u4e00\u76c5\u5169\u4ef6), which translates literally as \"one cup, two pieces\". This refers to the custom of serving teahouse customers two delicately made food items, savory or sweet, to complement their tea. The second is dim sum, which translates literally to \"touch the heart\", the term used to designate the small food items that accompanied the tea. Teahouse owners gradually added various snacks called dim sum to their offerings. The practice of having tea with dim sum eventually evolved into the modern \"yum cha\".[4] Cantonese dim sum culture developed rapidly during the latter half of the nineteenth century in Guangzhou.[8] Cantonese dim sum was originally based on local foods.[8] As dim sum continued to develop, chefs introduced influences and traditions from other regions of China.[8] Cantonese dim sum has a very broad range of flavors, textures, cooking styles, and ingredients[8] and can be classified into regular items, seasonal offerings, weekly specials, banquet dishes, holiday dishes, house signature dishes, and travel-friendly items, as well as breakfast or lunch foods and late-night snacks.[8] There are over one thousand dim sum dishes originating from Guangdong alone, a total that no other areas in China comes even close to matching. In fact, the cookbooks of most Chinese food cultures tend to lump their own variations on dim sum dishes with other local snacks. But that is not the case with Cantonese dim sum, which has developed into a separate branch of cuisine.[9][8] Some estimates claim that there are at least two thousand types of dim sum in total across China, and about forty to fifty types are commonly sold outside of China.[10][11] Dim sum restaurants typically have a wide variety of dishes, usually totaling several dozen.[12][13] The tea is very important, just as important as the food.[14][15] Many Cantonese restaurants serve dim sum as early as five in the morning,[16][17] while more traditional restaurants typically serve dim sum until mid-afternoon.[16][18][19] Dim sum restaurants have a unique serving method where servers offer dishes to customers from steam-heated carts.[9][20][21] It is now commonplace for restaurants to serve dim sum at dinner and sell various dim sum items \u00e0 la carte for takeout.[22] In addition to traditional dim sum, some chefs also create and prepare new fusion-based dim sum dishes.[23][24][25][26] There are also variations designed for visual appeal on social media, such as dumplings and buns made to resemble animals.[27][28] The original meaning of the term \"dim sum\" remains unclear and contested.[29] Some references state that the term originated in the Eastern Jin dynasty (317 AD\u2013420 AD).[30][31] According to one legend, to show soldiers gratitude after battles, a general had civilians make buns and cakes to send to the front lines. \"Gratitude\" or \u9ede\u9ede\u5fc3\u610f (pinyin: di\u01cen di\u01cen x\u012bn y\u00ec; Jyutping: dim2 dim2 sam1 ji3), later shortened to \u9ede\u5fc3, of which dim sum is the Cantonese pronunciation, came to represent dishes made in a similar fashion. Some versions date the legend to the Southern Song dynasty (960\u20131279) after the term's earliest attestation in the Book of Tang (Chinese: \u5510\u66f8; pinyin: T\u00e1ng sh\u016b; Jyutping: Tong4 Syu1).[31] Written in the Five Dynasties and Ten Kingdoms period (907\u2013979), the book uses dim sum as a verb instead: \u300c\u6cbb\u599d\u672a\u7562, \u6211\u672a\u53ca\u9910, \u723e\u4e14\u53ef\u9ede\u5fc3\u300d(pinyin: \"Zh\u00ec zhu\u0101ng w\u00e8i b\u00ec, w\u01d2 w\u00e8i j\u00ed c\u0101n, \u011br qi\u011b k\u011b di\u01cen x\u012bn\"; Jyutping: \"Zi6 zong1 mei6 bat1, ngo5 mei6 kap6 caan1, ji5 ce2 ho2 dim2 sam1\"), which translates to \"I have not finished preparing myself and am not ready for a proper meal; therefore, you can treat yourself to some small snacks.\"[31] In this context, \"dim sum\" means \"to barely fill your stomach\".[31] Dim sum dishes are usually associated with \"yum cha\" (Chinese: \u98f2\u8336; pinyin: y\u01d0n ch\u00e1; Cantonese Yale: y\u00e1m ch\u00e0h), which is known as the Cantonese brunch tradition.[32][33]  Chinese food historian Yan-kit So has described dim sum as:[34][2] Literally translated as \"so close to the heart\", they are, in reality, a large range of hors d'oeuvres Cantonese people traditionally enjoy in restaurants (previously teahouses) for breakfast and lunch but never for dinner, washed down with tea. \"Let's go yum cha\" (to drink tea) is understood among the Cantonese to mean going to a restaurant for dim sum; such is the twin linkage between the food and the beverage. There are at least two thousand types of dim sum in total across China,[10][11] and over one thousand available in Guangdong alone.[8][9][35] Dim sum are usually eaten as breakfast or brunch.[18][19] Cantonese dim sum has a very broad range of flavors, textures, cooking styles, and ingredients,[8] and can be classified into regular items, seasonal offerings, weekly specials, banquet dishes, holiday dishes, house signature dishes, travel-friendly, as well as breakfast or lunch foods and late night snacks.[8] The subtropical climate of the southeast quadrant of Guangdong partly influences dim sum's portion size.[8] It can cause a decrease in appetite,[36] so that people prefer eating scaled-down meals throughout the day rather than the customary three large meals.[8] Teahouses in Guangzhou served \"three teas and two meals,\" which included lunch and dinner, and breakfast, afternoon and evening teas with dim sum.[8] Many dim sum dishes are made of seafood, chopped meats, or vegetables wrapped in dough or thin wrappings and steamed, deep-fried, or pan-fried.[37][9][38] A traditional dim sum brunch includes various types of steamed buns, such as cha siu bao (a steamed bun filled with barbecue pork), rice or wheat dumplings, and rice noodle rolls that contain a range of ingredients, including beef, chicken, pork, prawns, and vegetarian options.[39][40] Many dim sum restaurants also offer plates of steamed green vegetables, stuffed eggplant, stuffed green peppers, roasted meats, congee and other soups.[41] Dessert dim sum is also available and can be ordered at any time since there is not a set sequence for the meal.[42][43] It is customary to order \"family-style\", sharing the small dishes consisting of three or four pieces of dim sum among all members of the dining party.[18][19][44][43] Small portion sizes allow people to try a wide variety of food.[19] Dim sum restaurants typically have a wide variety of dishes, usually several dozen.[12] Tea is considered to be very important, so much so that it is considered just as important as the food itself.[14][15] Teas served during dim sum include: The tea service includes several customs.[108][109][110][111] Typically, the server starts by asking diners which tea to serve. According to etiquette, the person closest to the tea pot pours tea for the others. Sometimes, a younger person will serve an older person. Those receiving tea express thanks by tapping their index and middle fingers twice on the table.[44][111] According to one legend, the finger-tapping tradition evolved from an incident when an emperor poured tea for his servant in a public teahouse during a trip where the emperor concealed his identity to mingle with the commoners. Having been instructed by the emperor to not expose his identity to the public, the servant showed gratitude by improvising the finger-tapping gesture instead of what should have been a kowtow, which would have betrayed the emperor's noble status. The practice gradually evolved to represent gratitude for having tea poured by others. Diners also flip open the lid (of hinged metal tea pots) or offset the tea pot cover (on ceramic tea pots) to signal an empty pot; servers will then refill the pot.[40][111] Dim sum is part of the Chinese tradition of snacks originating from the Song dynasty (960\u20131279), when royal chefs created various dishes such as minced pheasant, lark tongue, and desserts made from steamed milk and bean paste.[35] Guangzhou experienced an increase in commercial travel in the tenth century[4]  At that time, travelers would frequent teahouses for small-portion meals with tea called \"yum cha\" or \"tea\" meals.[5][4][6] Yum cha includes two related concepts. The first, \u4e00\u76c5\u5169\u4ef6, translates literally as \"one cup, two pieces\". This refers to the custom of serving teahouse customers two delicately made food items, savory or sweet, to complement their tea. The second, \u9ede\u5fc3, which means dim sum, translates literally to \"touch the heart\" (i.e., heart touching). This is the term used to designate the small food items that accompanied the drinking of tea.[7] During the thirteenth century, when the Mongols invaded China, the royal court fled to southern China, bringing a royal influence to the dim sum of Guangzhou.[35] Guangzhou was a wealthy, large port city that had international visitors, a temperate climate, and a coastline where fresh and tropical ingredients were grown, resulting in an ideal environment for food and entertainment.[35] In Guangzhou, street vendors and teahouses sold dim sum.[35] The practice of having tea with dim sum at tea houses eventually evolved into modern yum cha.[4] While at the teahouses, travelers selected their preferred snacks from carts.[4] Visitors to tea houses often socialized as they ate, and business people negotiated deals over dim sum.[4] During the Ming dynasty (1368\u20131644), the Tea and Horses Bureau was established to monitor tea production and improve tea quality.[35] The improvements in tea quality also led to teahouse improvements.[35] Cantonese dim sum culture developed rapidly during the latter half of the nineteenth century in Guangzhou.[8] Teahouse dining areas were typically located upstairs, and initial dim sum fare included steamed buns.[8] Eventually, these evolved into specialized dim sum restaurants, and the variety and quality of dim sum dishes rapidly followed suit.[8] Cantonese dim sum was originally based on local foods such as sweet roast pork called \"char siu\" and fresh rice noodles.[8] As dim sum continued to develop, chefs introduced influences and traditions from other regions of China, which created a starting point for the wide variety of dim sum available today.[8] Chefs created a large range of dim sum that even today comprises most of a teahouse's dim sum offerings.[8] Part of this development included reducing portion sizes of larger dishes originally from northern China, such as stuffed steamed buns, so they could easily be incorporated into the dim sum menu.[8] The rapid growth in dim sum restaurants was due partly because people found the preparation of dim sum dishes to be time-consuming and preferred the convenience of dining out and eating a large variety of baked, steamed, pan-fried, deep-fried, and braised foods.[8] Dim sum continued to develop and also spread southward to Hong Kong.[112] Although dim sum is normally considered Cantonese, it includes many additional influences.[8] Over thousands of years, as people in China migrated in search of different places to live, they carried the recipes of their favorite foods and continued to prepare and serve these dishes.[8] Many Han Chinese migrated south, seeking warmer climates.[8] Settlements took shape in the Yangtze River Valley, the central highlands, and the coastal southeast, including Guangdong.[8] The influence of Suzhou and Hangzhou is found in vegetarian soy skin rolls and pearl meatballs. The dessert squares flavored with red dates or wolfberries are influenced by Beijing desserts.[8] Savory dishes, such as pot stickers and steamed dumplings, include Muslim influences because of people traveling from Central Asia across the Silk Road and into Guangdong.[8] These are just a few examples of how a wide range of influences became incorporated into traditional Cantonese dim sum.[8] By 1860, foreign influences had to shape Guangdong's dim sum with culinary innovations such as ketchup, Worcestershire sauce, and curry, all of which came to be used in some savory dishes.[8] Custard pies evolved into the miniature classics found in every teahouse.[8] Other dim sum dishes evolved from Indian samosas, mango puddings, and Mexican conchas (snow-topped buns).[8] Cantonese-style dim sum has an extremely broad range of tastes, textures, cooking styles, and ingredients.[8] As a result, there are more than a thousand different varieties of dim sum.[8] During the 1920s, in Guangzhou, the foremost places to enjoy tea were its tea pavilions, which had refined and expansive surroundings.[8] The customers were wealthy, and there were rather high standards for the privilege of enjoying tea pavilion service and dim sum.[8] Upon entering a tea pavilion, customers would inspect tea leaves to ensure their quality and to verify the water temperature.[8] Once satisfied, these guests were presented with a pencil and a booklet listing the available dim sum.[8] A waiter would then tear their orders out of the booklet so that the kitchen could pan-fry, steam, bake, or deep-fry these dishes on demand.[8] Customers dined upstairs in privacy and comfort.[8] Servers carefully balanced the dishes on their arms or arranged them on trays as they climbed up and down the stairs.[8] Eventually, dim sum carts were used to serve the steamers and plates.[8] People with average incomes also enjoyed tea and dim sum.[8] Early every morning, customers visited inexpensive restaurants that offered filled steamed buns and hot tea.[8] During the mid-morning, students and government employees ordered two or three kinds of dim sum and ate as they read their newspapers.[8] In the late morning, people working at small businesses visited restaurants for breakfast and to use the restaurant as a small office space.[8] By the late 1930s, Guangzhou's teahouse culture included four high-profile dim sum chefs, with signs at the front doors of their restaurants.[8] There was heavy competition among teahouses, and as a result, new varieties of dim sum were invented almost daily, including dishes influenced by the tea pastries of Shanghai, Beijing, and the Western world.[8] Many new fusion dishes were also created, including puddings, baked rolls, turnovers, custard tarts, and Malay steamed cakes.[8] There were also significant increases in the variety of thin wrappers used in both sweet and savory items.[8] If we concentrate only on the changes and developments in the variety of wrappers, the main types of dim sum wrappers during the 1920s included such things as raised (for filled buns), wheat starch, shao mai (i.e., egg dough), crystal bun, crispy batter, sticky rice, and boiled dumpling wrappers. By the 1930s, the varieties of wrappers commonly used by chefs included puff pastry, Cantonese short pastry, and so on, for a total of 23 types that were prepared by pan-frying, deep-frying, steaming, baking, and roasting.[8][113] As the Chinese Civil War progressed from 1927 to 1949, many dim sum chefs left China and settled in Hong Kong, resulting in further refinements and innovations of the dim sum there.[35] Very large dim sum restaurants in major cities like Hong Kong, San Francisco, Boston, Toronto, and New York were also established.[35] In the nineteenth century, Cantonese immigrants brought dim sum to the west and east coasts of the United States.[114] Some of the earliest dim sum restaurants in the U.S. still operating today opened in the 1920s in San Francisco and New York City.[115][116] The history of San Francisco's Chinese community is believed to have started about 30 years before the first dim sum restaurant opened in the city's Chinatown neighborhood. The Chinese preferred to live in the present Chinatown area because of its restaurants and theatres.[115] In the late 1930s, some early U.S. newspaper references to dim sum began to appear. While some Chinese restaurants in the U.S. had offered dim sum for decades, it was not until the late 1980s that there was a broader public awareness of dim sum.[4] Although there was increased awareness of dim sum around this time, one chef from Hong Kong, who immigrated to San Francisco, noted that diners in the U.S. usually focused on the food itself and not the communal aspects of eating dim sum.[117] Although dim sum is a Chinese meal, it is a communal dining and social experience that can span hours.[117] It is customary for large groups to enjoy dishes together as a leisurely social activity.[117] Diners go to restaurants early, around 10:00\u00a0AM, and rather than ordering a whole table of food, they order small amounts, have a cup of tea, read the newspaper, and wait for friends and family to join them.[117] As a result, a visit to a dim sum restaurant can last from late morning well into the afternoon.[117] For some people in Hong Kong, eating dim sum is a daily routine and a way of life.[117] Since this dim sum tradition is not always present in some U.S. dim sum restaurants, however, approaches to generate interest and attract customers include customized seasoning and flavors of traditional dishes, as well as creating novel dishes with an emphasis on enhanced flavors and visual appeal.[117] One food reviewer notes that there has been an increase in popularity in posting dim sum photos on social media feeds, and that dim sum has become so popular that every U.S. state now has at least one high-quality dim sum restaurant.[118] There is a restaurant, bar, and highly rated dance club complex in Las Vegas, NV, that features high-end Cantonese food (including dim sum), craft cocktails, dinner parties, and prominent disc jockeys in a chic setting.[119][120][121][122] The dim sum restaurants in Chicago's Chinatown serve mainly traditional dim sum dishes, but there has been recent growth in contemporary dim sum with new fusion dishes, as well as restaurants now located outside Chinatown.[123] In Hong Kong, many chefs are also introducing variants based on traditional Cantonese cuisine, which generates interest and provides both Hongkongers and tourists with new, fresh dim sum dishes.[124] In addition to traditional dim sum, some chefs also create and prepare new fusion-based dim sum dishes.[23][24][25][26][125][123][126][127]  Modern versions of buns include pork belly steamed buns with cucumber, green onion, cilantro, and ginger hoisin sauce, cocoa mushroom buns, chili lamb buns.  Dumplings include snow pea shoot and shrimp dumplings, and chili crab with fried garlic, siu mai with pork, shrimp, scallop, and caviar, dumplings stuffed with shrimp and peanut, dumplings with South Australian scallop, garoupa (grouper), caviar, gold leaf, and egg white, and bone marrow or beef short ribs in potstickers.  Pastry puff dishes include Australian Wagyu beef puff, Assam curry chicken puff, and pumpkin puffs. Toast dishes include Hong Kong\u2013style French toast with condensed milk and peanut butter and prawn toast.  Additional examples are spring rolls filled with goat and duck skin and duck hearts cooked over a wood-fired grill and served with sesame-horseradish sauce. One AAA four-diamond-award-winning Chinese restaurant in Miami Beach has a prix-fixe dim sum menu, prix-fixe \"yum cha\" menu and breakfast cocktails.[128]  Variations designed for visual appeal on social media, such as dumplings and buns made to resemble animals and fictional characters, also exist.[27][28][129] Dim sum chefs have previously used cocoa powder as coloring to create steamed bread puffs to appear like forest mushrooms, espresso powder as both flavoring and coloring for deep-fried riblets, as well as pastry cream, and French puffs to create innovative dishes while paying tribute to the history of dim sum.[8] Dim sum can often be purchased from grocery stores in major cities.[108] They can be cooked easily by steaming, frying, or microwaving.[130][131] Major grocery stores in Hong Kong, Vietnam, the Philippines, Singapore, Taiwan, China, Indonesia, Malaysia, Brunei, Thailand, Australia,[132] the United States[133][134] and Canada[135] stock a variety of frozen or fresh dim sum. These include dumplings, shumai, pork buns, and others.[133] In Hong Kong and other cities in Asia, dim sum can be purchased from convenience stores, coffee shops and other eateries.[136][137] Halal-certified dim sum that uses chicken instead of pork is very popular in Hong Kong,[138] Malaysia,[139] Indonesia[140] and Brunei.[141] Some Cantonese restaurants serve dim sum as early as five in the morning,[17] while more traditional restaurants typically serve dim sum from mid-morning until mid-afternoon.[16][18][19] It is common for restaurants to serve dim sum during dinner as well as for takeout.[22] Dim sum is served using a unique serving method[20] whereby servers offer dishes to customers from carts, including some carts that are steam-heated.[9][20][21] Diners often prefer tables nearest the kitchen since servers and carts pass by these tables first.[43] Many restaurants place lazy susans on tables to help diners reach food and tea.[142] The pricing of dishes at these types of restaurants may vary, but traditionally they are classified as \"small\", \"medium\", \"large\", \"extra-large\", or \"special\".[42] Servers record orders with a rubber stamp or an ink pen on a bill card that remains on the table.[108][39][37] Servers in some restaurants use distinctive stamps to track sales statistics for each server.[citation needed] When they have finished eating, the customer calls the server over, and their bill is calculated based on the number of stamps or quantities marked in each priced section.[35][39][143] Another way of pricing the food that was consumed uses the number and color of the dishes left on the table.[8][35] Some restaurants offer a new approach by using a conveyor belt format.[144] Other Cantonese restaurants may take orders from a pre-printed sheet of paper and serve \u00e0 la carte, much like Spanish tapas restaurants,[145][146] to provide fresh, cooked-to-order dim sum or because of real estate and resource constraints.[147][148]", "Ceviche": "Ceviche, cebiche, sebiche, or seviche[a] (Spanish pronunciation: [se\u02c8\u03b2it\u0283e]) is a dish consisting of fish or shellfish marinated in citrus and seasonings, recognized by UNESCO as an expression of Peruvian traditional cuisine and Intangible Cultural Heritage of Humanity, although different versions of ceviche are part of the culinary culture of various Spanish-American countries along the Pacific Ocean[4] where each one is native: Chile, Colombia, Costa Rica, Ecuador, El Salvador, Guatemala, Honduras, Mexico, Nicaragua, Panama and Peru. In Peru it is also considered a flagship dish and cultural heritage.[5] The fish is typically cured in lemon or sour lime juice, although sour orange was historically used. The dressing also includes some local variety of chili pepper or chili, replaced by mustard in some locations in Central America. The meat is usually marinated together with sliced or chopped onion and served with chopped cilantro. In Mexico, tomato and avocado are also usually included,[6][7] and the addition of tomato sauce is common except in Chile, Panama and Peru. The ceviche accompaniments can also be different: in Ecuador, with plantain, canguil or chifles patacones, and in Colombia, Panama and Guatemala, with salty soda crackers. The northern varieties usually use cookies or toast as a garnish. In Mexico, it is served with corn tostadas or with crackers; in Panama an extra option is the spicy chombo chili pepper to taste, and in Peru, it is served with garnishes of boiled root vegetables such as sweet potatoes, cassava or, very rarely, potatoes, and grains or seeds such as corn (boiled or roasted), legumes such as zarandaja, fried plantain (chifles), seaweed and lettuce; sometimes it can be accompanied by chilcano (broth made from fish heads).[8][9] The first documented evidence of the term ceviche is from 1820, in the patriotic song \"La Chicha,\" considered the first Peruvian national anthem. According to the Royal Spanish Academy, the word might have the same etymology as the Spanish term escabeche, which derives from Mozarabic izkeb\u00each, in turn descending from Andalusian Arabic assukkab\u00e1\u01e7, which also derives from Classical Arabic sakb\u0101j (\u0633\u0643\u0628\u0627\u062c,[10] meaning meat cooked in vinegar).[11][12] It is ultimately from the unattested Middle Persian *sikb\u0101g, from sik (\"vinegar\")[13] and *b\u0101g (\"soup\"), which also yielded the Persian word sekb\u0101 (\u0633\u06a9\u0628\u0627, a soup made with meat and vinegar).[14] Another hypothesis is that it derives from the Quechua word siwichi, meaning fresh fish.[15] The name of the dish is spelled variously as cebiche, ceviche, seviche, or sebiche, but the most common spelling is ceviche with v, which is an alternative spelling accepted by the Royal Spanish Academy.[2][3] There are also other local variants of the name, including cerbiche and serviche.[16] Various explanations of the dish's origins exist, with Peruvian researchers favoring a Pre-Hispanic origin. According to some historic sources from Peru, the Caral Civilization that developed in central Peru between 3500 BC. to 1800 BC. has left evidence of the use and consumption of raw peruvian anchovy with chili and salt, according to the investigations of archaeologist Ruth Shady.[17] Another predecessor of ceviche originated among the Moche, a coastal civilization that began to flourish in present-day northern Peru nearly 2,000 years ago.[18][19][20] The Moche used the fermented juice from the local banana passionfruit.[19] Recent investigations further show that during the Inca Empire, fish was marinated with chicha, an Andean fermented beverage. Different chronicles also report that along the Incan coast before the arrival of Spaniards, fish was consumed with salt and aj\u00ed.[20] The dish is popular in the Pacific coastal regions of western South America.[21][19] The technique of macerating raw fish and meat in vinegar, citrus, and spices (escabeche) was brought to the Americas from Spain and is linked to the Muslim heritage in Spanish cuisine. However, archeological records suggest that something resembling ceviche may have been indigenous to western South America as early as 2,000 years ago.[19] Nevertheless, some historians believe that ceviche originated during colonial times in present-day Peru and Ecuador.[22][23][24] They propose that a predecessor to the dish[specify] was brought to the area by Andalusian women of Moorish background who accompanied the Conquistadors and that this dish eventually evolved into what nowadays is considered ceviche.[23][25] The Peruvian chef Gast\u00f3n Acurio further explains that the dominant position that Lima held throughout four centuries as the capital of the Viceroyalty of Peru, which at one point included most of western South America, allowed for popular dishes such as ceviche to be brought to other administrative provinces in the region, and in time becoming local cuisine incorporating regional flavors and styles.[26] National Geographic[27] and Taste Atlas[28] recognize the origin of Ceviche in Peru.\nThe Peruvian origin of the dish is supported by chefs including the Chilean Christopher Carpentier and the Spaniard Ferran Adri\u00e0, who in an interview stated, \"Cebiche was born in Peru, and so the authentic and genuine [cebiche] is Peruvian.\"[29][30] The first recipe of this dish was published by Manual Atanasio Fuentes in \"The Guide of Lima.\"[clarification needed]\n[31] Its origin is also attributed to places ranging from Central America to Polynesia.[32][33][34][35] In Ecuador, it may have had its origins in coastal civilizations, as Ecuador shares cultural heritages (such as the Inca Empire) and a wide variety of fish and shellfish with Peru. The Ecuadorian position traces the origin of ceviche to the harvest of the Spondylus shell in the years 3500\u00a0BC to 1500\u00a0BC in the Valdivia Culture which had a diet that used marine products that were later used in ceviche.[36][37][38][39] The Spanish, who brought citrus fruits such as the lime from Europe, may have originated the dish in Spain with roots in moorish cuisine.[40] Peruvian historian Juan Jos\u00e9 Vega supports the theory put forward by Fernando Rueda Garc\u00eda, historian of M\u00e1laga and a member of the Andalusian Ethnology Commission, who suggests that it was Moorish slaves who created the cebiche by mixing local and foreign ingredients that were arriving on the Iberian Peninsula.[41] On December 2023, the practices and meanings associated with the preparation and consumption of ceviche, were recognized by UNESCO as an expression of Peruvian traditional cuisine and Intangible Cultural Heritage of Humanity. The statement was made within the framework of the eighteenth session of its Intergovernmental Committee for the Safeguarding of the Intangible Cultural Heritage. As a basis for its decision, it was considered that the preparation and consumption of ceviche in Peru, \"entail specific practices, knowledge and meanings at each stage, from fishing to cultivating the ingredients and preparing the dish. As recipes vary from one region to the next, the dish also strengthens regional cultural identity\".[42] In awarding the honor to Peru's ceviche, UNESCO highlighted the role of the dish in Peru's cultural identity, the importance of artisanal sustainable fishers and traditional female ceviche cooks in cevicher\u00edas, regional variations of the dish, and how the knowledge of ingredients and techniques are passed down through families in Peru.[43] Ceviche is marinated in a citrus-based mixture, with lemons and limes most commonly used. In addition to adding flavor, the citric acid causes the proteins in the seafood to become denatured, resulting in the dish appearing to be cooked without the application of heat. Because the dish is eaten raw and not cooked with heat, it must be prepared fresh and consumed immediately to minimize the risk of food poisoning.[44] Acid marinades will not kill bacteria or parasitic worms, unlike the heat of cooking. Traditional-style ceviche was marinated for about three hours. Modern-style ceviche, popularized in the 1970s, usually has a very short marinating period. The appropriate fish can marinate in the time it takes to mix the ingredients, serve, and carry the ceviche to the table.[45] Ceviche is often eaten as an appetizer; if eaten as a main dish, it is usually accompanied by side dishes that complement its flavors, such as sweet potato, lettuce, maize, avocado, or cooking banana.[19][46][16] Most Latin American countries have given ceviche its own touch of individuality by adding their own particular garnishes. In Peru, ceviche has been declared part of the country's national heritage and has even had a holiday declared in its honor.[47] The classic Peruvian ceviche is composed of chunks of raw fish, marinated in freshly squeezed key lime, with sliced onions, chili peppers, salt and pepper. Corvina or cebo (sea bass) was the fish traditionally used. The mixture was traditionally marinated for several hours and served at room temperature, with chunks of corn on the cob and slices of cooked sweet potato. Regional or contemporary variations include garlic, fish bone broth, minced Peruvian aj\u00ed limo, or the Andean chili rocoto, toasted corn or cancha and yuyo (seaweed). A specialty of Trujillo is ceviche prepared from shark (tollo or tojo). Lenguado (sole) is often used in Lima. The modern version of Peruvian ceviche, similar to the method used in making Japanese sashimi, consists of fish marinated for a few minutes and served promptly. It was developed in the 1970s by Peruvian-Japanese chefs, including Dario Matsufuji and Humberto Sato.[48]  Many Peruvian cevicher\u00edas serve a small glass of the marinade, which is called leche de tigre or leche de pantera, as an appetizer along with the fish. According to a study of the Inter-American Development Bank (IDB) about innovation in Peruvian Cuisine and its connection with Peruvian cultural diversity (2022),[49] an example of the impact on gastronomy of culture and population diversity throughout its territory \u2014in which fishers, farmers and chefs come together\u2014 is the great variety of ceviches offered by Peruvian marine cuisine. In his book Ceviche Power (2015),[50] Gaston Acurio  documents the different nuances through the tour of the ceviche route through Tumbes, Piura, Lambayeque, La Libertad, Ancash, the Lima coast, Lima, Ica, Arequipa, Moquegua and Tacna. This great diversity has motivated different chefs to create new types of ceviches. In Ecuador, the classic ceviche is made up of pieces of fish pickled in lemon juice and cooked[51] or shrimp cooked using the tomato juice or water along with the shrimp shells,[52] with sliced red onions, sliced tomatoes, salt, pepper, cilantro, and oil. The mixture is traditionally marinated for several hours and served with a bowl of toasted corn kernels as a side dish; fried green plantain chunks called \"patacones\", or thinly sliced plantain chips called chifles. In some regions, ceviche is served with rice on the side. Ceviches in Ecuador are seasoned with tomato sauce, mustard, and oil. The Manab\u00ed\n style, made with lemon juice, salt, and the juice provided by the cooked shrimp itself, and sometimes topped with peanut butter, is very popular. Occasionally, ceviche is made with various types of local shellfish, such as black clam (cooked or raw), oysters (cooked or raw), spondylus (raw), barnacles (cooked percebes), among others mostly cooked.  Well-cooked sea bass (corvina) or bicuda (picudo), octopus, and crab ceviches are also common in Ecuador. In all ceviches, red onion, lemon juice, cilantro, salt, and oil are ubiquitous ingredients.[53] In Chile, ceviche is often made with fillets of halibut or Patagonian toothfish[54] and marinated in lime and grapefruit juices; finely minced garlic and red chili peppers[55] and often fresh mint and cilantro are added.[56][57] On Easter Island, the preferred fish is tuna, marinated in lemon juice and coconut milk. In Colombia, cebiches or shrimp cocktails,[58] oysters, crabs, squid, chipi chipi, among others, and combinations of them are prepared. The sauce includes tomato sauce, mayonnaise, garlic sauce, cilantro, chopped white onion, lemon juice, among other seasonings. They are accompanied with salty soda cracker.[59] In Mexico, the U.S., and some parts of Central America, it is served either in cocktail cups with tostadas or as a tostada topping and taco filling. In Mexico, when served in a cup with tomato sauce, it is called a ceviche cocktail. Shrimp, octopus, squid, tuna, and mackerel are also popular bases for Mexican ceviche. The marinade ingredients include salt, lime, onion, chili peppers, avocado, and cilantro (coriander). Cut olives and tomatoes are often added to the preparation. In El Salvador and Nicaragua, one popular ceviche recipe is ceviche de concha negra (\"black conch ceviche\"), known in Mexico as pata de mula (\"mule's foot\"). It is dark, nearly black, with a distinct look and flavor. It is prepared with lime juice, onion, yerba buena, salt, pepper, tomato, Worcestershire sauce, and sometimes picante (any hot sauce or any kind of hot pepper) as desired. The dish includes marinated fish, lime juice, salt, ground black pepper, finely minced onions, cilantro, and finely minced peppers in Nicaragua and Costa Rica. It is usually served in a cocktail glass with a lettuce leaf and soda crackers on the side, as in Mexico. Popular condiments are tomato ketchup, mayonnaise, and Tabasco sauce. The fish is typically tilapia or corvina, although mahi-mahi, shark, and marlin are also popular. In Panama, ceviche is prepared with lemon juice, chopped onion, celery, cilantro, assorted peppers, and sea salt. Ceviche made with corvina (white sea bass) is very popular and is served as an appetizer in most local restaurants. It is also commonly prepared with octopus, shrimp, and squid or served with small pastry shells called \"canastitas.\" In the Caribbean, ceviche is often made using mahi-mahi prepared with lime juice, salt, onion, green pepper, habanero, and a touch of allspice. Squid and tuna are also popular. In Puerto Rico and other places in the Caribbean, the dish is prepared with coconut milk. In the Bahamas and south Florida, a conch ceviche known as conch salad is very popular. It is prepared by marinating diced fresh conch in lime, chopped onions,  and bell pepper. Diced pequin pepper or Scotch bonnet pepper is often added for spice. In south Florida, it is common to encounter a variation to which tomato juice has been added. Bad sanitary conditions in its preparation may lead to illness. Aside from contaminants, raw seafood can also be the vector for various pathogens, viral and bacterial, as well as larger parasitic creatures.[60][61] According to the United States Food and Drug Administration and studies since 2009, specific microbial hazards in ceviche include Anisakis simplex, Diphyllobothrium spp., Pseudoterranova decipiens and Pseudoterranova cattani, and Vibrio parahaemolyticus.[62][63] Anisakiasis is a zoonotic disease caused by the ingestion of larval nematodes in raw seafood dishes such as ceviche.[64][65] The Latin American cholera outbreaks in the 1990s may have been attributed to the consumption of raw cholera-infested seafood that was eaten as ceviche.[66] The American Dietetic Association urges women to avoid ceviche during pregnancy due to the health risks it introduces if not prepared properly.[67] Cold; cured with lime juice", "Kebab": " Kebab (UK: /k\u026a\u02c8b\u00e6b/, US: /k\u026a\u02c8b\u0251\u02d0b/; Persian: \u0643\u0628\u0627\u0628,[1] kab\u0101b, Arabic: \u0643\u0628\u0627\u0628,[2] [ka\u02c8ba\u02d0b]; Turkish: kebap, [keb\u0251p]), kabob (North American), kebap, or kabab (Kashmir) is a variety of roasted meat dishes that originated in the Middle East. Many variants of kebab are popular around the world, including the skewered shish kebab, Joojeh Kebab (Iranian chicken kebab) and the doner kebab with bread. Kebabs consist of cut up or ground meat, sometimes with vegetables and various other accompaniments according to the specific recipe. Although kebabs are typically cooked on a skewer over a fire, some kebab dishes are oven-baked in a pan, or prepared as a stew such as tas kebab.[3][4] The traditional meat for kebabs is most often lamb meat, but regional recipes may include beef, goat, chicken, fish, or even pork (depending on whether or not there are specific religious prohibitions). In Ibn Sayyar al-Warraq's 10th-century Baghdadi cookbook Kitab al-Tabikh (Arabic: \u0643\u062a\u0627\u0628 \u0627\u0644\u0637\u0628\u064a\u062e), a compendium of much of the legacy of Mesopotamian, Persian, and Arab cuisines, there are descriptions of kab\u0101b as cut-up meat, either fried in a pan or grilled over a fire.[5] However, while the word kebab or shish kebab may sometimes be used in English as a culinary term that refers to any type of small chunks of meat cooked on a skewer,[3] kebab is mainly associated with a diversity of meat dishes that originated in the medieval kitchens of Persia and Anatolia.[6] The word has ancient origins. It was popularized in the West by Turks to refer to a range of grilled and broiled meat, which may be cooked on skewers, including stews, meatballs, and many other forms.[3][6] This cuisine has spread around the world, in parallel with Muslim influence.[3] According to Ibn Battuta, a Maghrebi traveller, kebab was served in the royal houses during the Delhi Sultanate (1206\u20131526), and even commoners would enjoy it for breakfast with naan.[7] Kebab dishes have been adopted and integrated with local cooking styles and innovations, from the now-ubiquitous doner kebab fast food, to the many variations of shish kebab, such as the satays of Southeast Asia.[3] The word kebab likely came to English in the late 17th century from the Persian kab\u0101b, partly through Hindustani, and Turkish.[8][2] According to linguist Sevan Ni\u015fanyan, the Turkish word kebap is also derived from the Persian word kab\u0101b, meaning roasted meat. It appears in Turkish texts as early as the 14th century, in Kyssa-i Yusuf (lit.\u2009'the story of Joseph'), though still in the Persian form. Ni\u015fanyan states that the word has the equivalent meaning of 'frying, burning' with kab\u0101bu in the old Akkadian language, and kbab\u0101 \u05db\u05d1\u05d1\u05d0 in Aramaic.[9] In contrast, food historian Gil Marks says that the medieval Arabic and Turkish terms were adopted from the Persian kabab, which probably derived from the Aramaic.[6] The American Heritage Dictionary also gives a probable East Semitic root origin with the meaning of 'burn', 'char', or 'roast', from the Aramaic and Akkadian.[10] The Babylonian Talmud instructs that Temple offerings not be kabbaba (burned).[6] These words point to an origin in the prehistoric Proto-Afroasiatic language: *kab-, to burn or roast.[11] In most English-speaking countries, a kebab may be the classic shish kebab or souvlaki \u2013 small cubes of meat cooked on a skewer[3][8] \u2013 or made with minced (ground) meat, as in doner kebab.[12][8][6] By contrast, in Indian English, Bangladeshi English, Pakistani English[13][14] and in the languages of the Middle East, other parts of Asia, and the Muslim world, a kebab is any of a wide variety of grilled meat dishes. Some dishes ultimately derived from Middle Eastern kebab may have different names in their local languages, such as the Chinese chuan. Chuan (Chinese: \u4e32; pinyin: chu\u00e0n), often referred to as \"chuan\" in Mandarin throughout the north, or kawap (\u0643\u0627\u06cb\u0627\u067e) in Uyghur, is a variation of kebab originating from the Uyghur people in the western province of Xinjiang and a popular dish in Chinese Islamic cuisine. The dish has since spread across the rest of the country and become a popular street food. Although the most traditional form of chuan uses lamb or mutton, other types of meat, such as chicken, beef, pork, and seafood, may be used as well. Small pieces of meat are skewered and either roasted or deep-fried. Common spices and condiments include cumin called \"ziran\", pepper, sesame, and sesame oil. While the history of street foods in Greece goes back to ancient times, the iconic Greek gyros and souvlaki as it is known today arose only following the Second World War. Introduced to Athens in the 1950s by Greek refugees from Turkey and the Middle East, gyros was originally known simply as d\u00f6ner kebab. It is typically served as a sandwich rolled in pita bread, or on a plate, with french fries and various salads and sauces such as tzatziki. Later in the 1960s, vendors also began selling dishes in the same style made with souvlaki, which resembles Turkish shish kebab, but is usually made with pork.[15] Around the same time, the Greek word gyros replaced d\u00f6ner kebab, and the Greek style of the dish spread to become popular, particularly in North America, and various other parts of the world.[16] In contrast to other areas of Greece, in Athens, both types of sandwich may be called souvlaki, with the skewered meat being called kalamaki. Although gyros is unquestionably of Middle Eastern origin, the issue of whether modern-day souvlaki came to Greece via Turkish cuisine, and should be considered a Greek styling of shish kebab, or is a contemporary revival of Greek tradition dating as far back as 17th century BC Minoan civilization,[17] is a topic of sometimes heated debate, at least between Greeks and Turks.[18] While English speakers may refer to souvlaki skewers as kebabs,[19] they are not properly called that in Greece. Both Armenian and Azerbaijani cuisine feature oblong kofta-style mincemeats kebabs known as lula or lyulya kebab, while \nArmenian cuisine refers to shish-style kebabs as khorovats,[20][21] and doner kebab as Karsi khorovats after the city of Kars which became known for the dish during the time of the Ottoman Empire.[21] There are several distinct Persian varieties of kabab (Persian: \u06a9\u0628\u0627\u0628). Kabab may be served with either steamed, saffroned basmati or Persian rice and called chelow kabab (\u0686\u0644\u0648\u06a9\u0628\u0627\u0628), which is considered the national dish of Iran.[22] It may also be served with the various types of bread that are the most commonly eaten in Iran, such as lavash. It is served with the basic Iranian meal accompaniments, in addition to grilled tomatoes on the side of the rice and butter on top of the rice. It is an old northern tradition (probably originating in Tehran) that a raw egg yolk should be placed on top of the rice as well, though this is strictly optional, and most restaurants will not serve the rice this way unless it is specifically requested. \"Somagh\", powdered sumac, is also made available and its use varies based on tastes to a small dash on the rice or a heavy sprinkling on both rice and meat, particularly when used with red (beef/veal/lamb) meat. At Persian restaurants, the combination of one kabab barg and one kabab koobideh is typically called Soltani, meaning \"sultan's feast\". The combination of one kabab barg, one jujeh kabab and kabab koobideh is typically called Shah abbasi, meaning \"Shah Abbas' meal\". The traditional beverage of choice to accompany Persian kabab is doogh, a sour yogurt drink with mint and salt. In the old bazaar tradition, the rice (which is covered with a tin lid) and accompaniments are served first, immediately followed by the kababs, which are brought to the table by the waiter, who holds several skewers in his left hand, and a piece of flat bread (typically nan-e lavash) in his right. A skewer is placed directly on the rice and while holding the kebab down on the rice with the bread, the skewer is quickly pulled out. With the two most common kababs, barg and koobideh, two skewers are always served. In general, bazaar kabab restaurants only serve these two varieties, though there are exceptions. In Iranian Azerbaijan, \"Binab (also Bonab) Kababi\" is very famous in Iranian Azerbaijani local cuisine for its large size.[23] It is named after the city of Binab in East Azerbaijan province. This kabab and other types (e.g., Shishlik, Kubide, Berge, Gelin, etc.) can be served alone or with rice and fresh salad on the side. In this region Kababs come usually with yogurt, hot bread, tomato, onion, parsley and paprika-salt, and tarragon. Kabab koobideh (\u06a9\u0628\u0627\u0628 \u06a9\u0648\u0628\u06cc\u062f\u0647) it k\u016bbide (\u06a9\u0648\u0628\u06cc\u062f\u0647) is an Iranian minced meat kabab which is made from ground lamb, beef, or chicken, often mixed with parsley and chopped onions. Kabab Koobideh contains: ground meat, onion, salt, pepper, turmeric, and seasoning. These ingredients are mixed together until the mixture becomes smooth and sticky. One egg is added to help the mix stick together. The mixture is then pressed around a skewer. Koobideh Kabab is typically 18\u00a0to 20 centimeters (7\u20138\u00a0in) long. Kab\u0101b-e Barg (Persian: \u06a9\u0628\u0627\u0628 \u0628\u0631\u06af) is a Persian style barbecued lamb, chicken or beef kabab dish. The main ingredients of Kabab Barg\u00a0\u2013 a short form of this name\u00a0\u2013 are fillets of beef tenderloin, lamb shank or chicken breast, onions and olive oil. Marinade is prepared by the mixture of half a cup of olive oil, three onions, garlic, half teaspoon saffron, salt and black pepper. One kilogram of lamb is cut into 1\u00a0cm thick and 4\u20135\u00a0cm long pieces. It should be marinated overnight in refrigerator, and the container should be covered. The next day, the lamb is threaded on long, thin metal skewers. It is brushed with marinade and is barbecued for 5\u201310 minutes on each side. J\u016bjeh Kab\u0101b (\u062c\u0648\u062c\u0647\u200c\u06a9\u0628\u0627\u0628) consists of pieces of chicken first marinated in minced onion and lemon juice with saffron then grilled over a fire. It is sometimes served with grilled tomato and pepper. Jujeh Kabab is one of the most popular Persian dishes. Kabab Bakhtiari is a combination of Jujeh kabab (chicken kabab) and Kabab barg (beef or lamb meat) on the same skewer. Its name comes from the Bakhtiari region of Iran. Kabab Kenjeh, also known as Chenjeh (\u06a9\u0646\u062c\u0647\u200c\u06a9\u0628\u0627\u0628, \u0686\u0646\u062c\u0647) is a kabab traditionally made with chunks of marinated lamb meat. It is typically served with grilled tomatoes and rice or bread.[24] Kabab Torsh is an Iranian Kabab from the northern provinces of Gilan and Mazandaran, renowned for its sour, pomegranate based seasoning.[25] Kabab Lari, Kabab Tabei (Pan Kabab), Dande Kabab, Kabab Shandiz, Shishlik Kabab, Kabab Ghafghazi, Uzun kabab of Tabriz,  Doosh Kabab of Guilan, Chump (Jump) Kabab of Sistan, Kabab Toori of Tabriz, Kabob Golpayegan, Kabab Tanoorcheh of Baluchestan, Kabab Soltani, Kabob Vaziri, Kabob Loghmeh, Taas Kabab, Mahi Kabab (Fish Kabab) and Kabab Jegar (Sheep Liver Kaba ) are among other types of Persian Kababs popular in Iran. Several types of kebab are popular in Iraqi cuisine, although the word kebab in local use is reserved for skewers of spiced ground lamb, traditionally grilled on natural wood charcoal to give the kebab its special flavor. Skewers of grilled marinated meat chunks are called tikka.[6] Several varieties of kebabs can be found in Levantine cuisine. Among the most common are shish taouk, which are grilled chicken skewers marinated in olive oil and spices, and lahem meshwi, charcoal-grilled skewers of prime lamb cubes lightly seasoned with herbs.[6] Mizrahi Jews brought various types of grilled meat from their native Middle Eastern countries to Israel, where they have become an essential part of Israeli cuisine.[6] Among the most popular are skewers of elongated spiced ground meat, called kabab (Hebrew: \u05e7\u05d1\u05d1), which have become a staple dish of meat restaurants and the main dish of the traditional holiday barbecues, alongside the shishlik. They are commonly made of beef, though lamb is also occasionally used, and are almost always served with the local pita bread. Shawarma, although not considered a kebab in most countries of the Levant and Egypt, is another very popular type of grilled meat preparation that characterizes this region. South Asia has a rich kebab tradition with a great variety of different kebab dishes. Many modern kebabs in Bangladeshi, Indian and Pakistani cuisine trace their origins back to the time of the Mughals and the strong influence of Mughlai cuisine. Kebab dishes common to one or more of these countries include: Afghan kebab (Pashto/Dari: \u06a9\u0628\u0627\u0628) is most often found in restaurants and outdoor vendor stalls. The most widely used meat is lamb. Recipes differ with every restaurant. In Afghan cuisine, kebab is served with naan, rarely rice, and customers have the option to sprinkle sumac or ghora, dried ground sour grapes, on their kebab. The quality of kebab is solely dependent on the quality of the meat. Pieces of fat from the sheep's tail (jijeq) are usually added with the lamb skewers to add extra flavor. Other popular kebabs include the lamb chop, ribs, beef, buffalo, and chicken, all of which are found in better restaurants. Chapli kebab, a specialty of Eastern Afghanistan, is a patty made from beef mince. It is prepared flat and round, and served with naan. The original recipe of chapli kebab dictates a half meat (or less), half flour mixture, which renders it lighter in taste and less expensive. In Bangladesh they make variations of kebab (Bengali \u0995\u09be\u09ac\u09be\u09ac or \"Kabab\"). In the old Mughal province of Bengal Subah's capital of Dhaka, various Pakistani and Indian-influenced dishes started to be made. Amongst these were kebabs. In Bangladeshi cuisine, most kebabs are made using fish or beef. Modern-day kebabs in India mostly trace their origin to the influence of Mughlai cuisine.[3] Some Indian kebabs have very specific geographic attributions, such as Kakori kebab, which is made of finely ground, soft mince and attributed to the city of Kakori in Uttar Pradesh, where legend has it that it was first prepared for old and toothless pilgrims.[39] In Pakistan kebabs trace back their origin during the time of the Mughals Mughlai cuisine, and their influence on the cuisine of modern-day Pakistan. There are all sorts of kebab varieties such as seekh, chapli, shammi and other forms of roasted and grilled meats. As Pakistan is a predominantly Muslim country, pork is not used. Instead meats like beef, chicken, lamb, fish and sometimes buff are used in the making of kebabs. Satay is a kebab of seasoned, skewered, and grilled meat, served with a sauce.[40] It is a dish of Southeast Asia, particularly Indonesia, Malaysia, and Thailand.[41] Satay may consist of diced or sliced chicken, goat, lamb, mutton, beef, pork, fish, other meats, or tofu. Traditionally skewers from the midrib of the coconut palm frond are used, although bamboo skewers are often used instead. It is grilled or barbecued over a wood or charcoal fire with spicy seasonings. It may be served with various sauces, though most often a combination of soy and peanut sauce.[42] Hence, peanut sauce is often called satay sauce.[43] Satay was developed by Javanese street vendors as a unique adaptation of Indian kebab.[41][44] The introduction of satay, and other now-iconic dishes such as tongseng and gulai kambing based on meats such as goat and lamb, coincided with an influx of Indian and Arab traders and immigrants starting in the 18th century.[45] It is available almost anywhere in Indonesia, where it has become a national dish.[46][47][48] In Sri Lanka, it has become a staple of the local diet as a result of the influences from the local Malay community.[49] Sosatie (plural sosaties) is a traditional South African dish of meat (usually lamb or mutton) cooked on skewers.[50] The term derives from sate (\"skewered meat\") and saus (spicy sauce). It is of Cape Malay origin. Sosatie recipes vary, but commonly the ingredients can include cubes of lamb, beef, chicken, dried apricots, red onions and mixed peppers. Suya is a spicy kebab which is a popular food item in West Africa that originated in Nigeria.[51][52] It is traditionally prepared by the Hausa people of Nigeria, Cameroon, Niger, Ghana and some parts of Sudan (where it is called agashe). Kyinkyinga is common and popular in West Africa.[53][54] It is a Ghanaian dish, very similar to or synonymous with the Hausa suya kebab, also known as sooya, tsinga, chichinga, tsire agashi, chachanga or tankora.[55][56][57] \u0106evapi (pronounced [t\u0255\u025bv\u031e\u01ce\u02d0pi]) or \u0107evap\u010di\u0107i (formal diminutive, [t\u0255\u025bv\u031e\u01cept\u0283it\u0255i], \u045b\u0435\u0432\u0430\u043f\u0447\u0438\u045b\u0438), which comes from the word kebab, is a grilled dish of minced meat, a type of skinless sausage, found traditionally in the countries of southeastern Europe (the Balkans). They are considered a national dish in Bosnia and Herzegovina[58] and Serbia[59][60][61] and are also common in Croatia, Kosovo, Montenegro, Albania, Slovenia, as well as in North Macedonia, Bulgaria, Romania. \u0106evapi has its origins in Bosnia and Herzegovina during the Ottoman period, and represents a regional speciality similar to the kofte kebab. A dish with similar origins is in Romania called mititei.[62] Pinchitos or Pinchos Morunos is a Moorish-derived kebab dish in Spanish cuisine. The name pinchitos is used in the southern Spanish autonomous communities of Andalusia and Extremadura. They consist of small cubes of meat threaded onto a skewer (Spanish: pincho) which are traditionally cooked over charcoal braziers. Similar dishes in North Africa or other Muslim majority countries tend to be lamb-based, but pork and chicken are the most popular meats for the dish in Spain. Pinchitos are also extremely popular in Venezuela, due to the heavy influence Spain had in Venezuelan cuisine during many years. Shashlik is similar to, or sometimes a synonym for, shish kebab. It is popular in many countries, particularly in Eastern and Central Europe, the Caucasus, and the Baltics. In non-Muslim-majority countries, shashlik and equivalent dishes like Romanian frig\u0103rui[6] may sometimes be prepared with pork. Kebab cuisine has spread around the world together with Muslim influence.[3] Although non-Muslim Westerners may be increasingly familiar with some of the many other international kebab dishes, only two have become an established and widely popular part of the culture in many Western countries. In English, the word kebab commonly refers to shish kebab and, outside of North America, to d\u00f6ner kebab or related fast-food dishes.[6] These dishes are also served in many other countries, where they may have different names.[63][64] Kebabs have also met opposition: in Italy, several cities banned kebab shops in order to preserve Italian culinary culture.[65][66] Many protested against these bans as \"racist\".[65] In English, kebab, or in North America also kabob, often occurring as shish kebab, is now a culinary term for small pieces of meat cooked on a skewer.[3] The word kebab, most likely derived from Persian,[8] has been used with various spellings in this sense since at least the 17th century,[13] while the Oxford English Dictionary records the earliest known publication of the term shish kebab, derived from Turkish: \u015fi\u015f kebap, in 1914.[67] \nThere are two etymologies suggested for Shish Kabob in the Persian dictionary of Dehkhoda: Shish being the Persian word \"Shish\" for the number 6, which refers to the original six pieces of meat of a standard Kabob skewer, or \"Shish\" being driven from Late Middle Persian \"Sich\" meaning a skewer. The word \"Kabob\" is most probably driven from the Arhameic word kb\u0101b\u0101 (to roast).[68]\nIn many English-speaking countries, it refers to the now well-known dish prepared with marinated meat or seafood together with vegetables such as onions, tomatoes, and bell peppers threaded onto the skewer, also sometimes known as shashlik.[69] This preparation is different from the typical Turkish shish kebab style, where vegetables are usually cooked on a separate skewer.[35] Shish kebabs are customarily prepared in homes and restaurants, and are usually cooked on a grill or barbecue, or roasted in an oven. The word kebab may also be used as a general term in English to describe any similar-looking skewered food, such as brochette, satay, souvlaki, yakitori, or numerous small chunks of any type of food served on a stick. This is different from its use in the West Asia, where shish (Persian/Mazandarani: \u0634\u06cc\u0634, Turkish: \u015fi\u015f) is the word for skewer, while kebab comes from the word for grilling.[6] English speakers from countries outside North America may also use the word kebab generally to mean the popular fast food version of the Turkish d\u00f6ner kebab,[63] or the related shawarma or gyros, and the sandwiches made with them, available from kebab shops as take-away meals. This usage may be found in some non-English parts of Europe as well. In North America, the Greek variant gyros is most widely known. The d\u00f6ner kebab originated in 19th century Turkey, but it became widely popular in the West only in the latter half of the 20th century. Many layers of meat are stacked onto a large vertical rotating spit; the outer surface is gradually cooked and sliced off, and typically served either mixed or topped with vegetables and sauces in a sandwich made with pita or other flatbreads. Certain regional variants also include cheeses. Sandwiches served in the same manner, but with other meats or cheese, may also sometimes be called a \"kebab\". It is available in most parts of Europe, and many other countries, though sometimes with different names or serving styles. In Germany, the highly popular sandwich, introduced by Turkish immigrants, is called a D\u00f6ner, though Arab shops there serve shawarma.[70]  Hot", "Fondue": "Fondue (UK: /\u02c8f\u0252nd(j)u\u02d0/, US: /f\u0252n\u02c8d(j)u\u02d0/,[3][4] French: [f\u0254\u0303dy]) is a Swiss[5] melted cheese and wine dish served in a communal pot (caquelon or fondue pot) over a portable stove (r\u00e9chaud) heated with a candle or spirit lamp, and eaten by dipping bread and sometimes vegetables into the cheese using long-stemmed forks. It was promoted as a Swiss national dish by the Swiss Cheese Union (Schweizerische K\u00e4seunion) in the 1930s, and was popularized in North America in the 1960s. Since the 1950s, the term \"fondue\" has been generalized to other dishes in which a food is dipped into a communal pot of liquid kept hot in a fondue pot: chocolate fondue, fondue au chocolat, in which pieces of fruit or pastry are dipped into a melted chocolate mixture, and fondue bourguignonne, in which pieces of meat are cooked in hot oil or broth.[6] The word fondue is the feminine passive past participle of the French verb fondre 'to melt' and so means 'melted'; it is used as a noun.[7] It is first attested in French in 1735, in Vincent La Chapelle's Cuisinier moderne,[8] and in English in 1878.[9] The earliest known recipe for the modern form of cheese fondue comes from a 1699 book published in Z\u00fcrich, under the name \"K\u00e4ss mit Wein zu kochen\" 'to cook cheese with wine'.[10] It calls for grated or cut-up cheese to be melted with wine, and for bread to be dipped in it. However, the name \"cheese fondue\", until the late 19th century, referred to a dish composed of eggs and cheese, as in la Chapelle's 1735 Fondu\u00eb de Fromage, aux Truffes Fraiches;[8] it was something between scrambled eggs with cheese and a cheese souffl\u00e9.[11] Brillat-Savarin wrote in 1834 that it is \"nothing other than scrambled eggs with cheese\".[12] Variations included cream (\"\u00e0 la genevoise\") and truffles (\"\u00e0 la pi\u00e9montaise\") in addition to eggs, as well as what is now called \"raclette\" (\"fondue valaisanne\").[13] The first known recipe for the modern cheese fondue under that name, with cheese and wine but no eggs, was published in 1875, and was already presented as a Swiss national dish.[14] Despite its modern associations with rustic mountain life, it was a town-dweller's dish from the lowlands of western, French-speaking, Switzerland: rich cheese like Gruy\u00e8re was a valuable export item which peasants could not afford to eat.[15][16] With the introduction of corn starch to Switzerland in 1905, it became easier to make a smooth and stable emulsion of the wine and cheese, and this probably contributed to the success of fondue.[17] Fondue was popularized as a Swiss national dish by the Swiss Cheese Union (Schweizerische K\u00e4seunion) in the 1930s as a way of increasing cheese consumption. The Swiss Cheese Union also created pseudo-regional recipes as part of the \"spiritual defence of Switzerland\".[18][19] After World War II rationing ended, the Swiss Cheese Union continued its marketing campaign, sending fondue sets to military regiments and event organizers across Switzerland. Fondue is now a symbol of Swiss unity.[18] Fondue is also often associated with mountains and winter sports.[20] In the meantime, fondue continued to be promoted aggressively in Switzerland, with slogans like \"La fondue cr\u00e9e la bonne humeur\" 'fondue creates a good mood' and (1981, in Swiss German) \"Fondue isch guet und git e gueti Luune\" 'fondue is good and creates a good mood' \u2013 abbreviated as \"figugegl\".[21] Fondue was promoted to Americans at the Swiss Pavilion's Alpine restaurant at the 1964 New York World's Fair.[22] A fondue party can be great fun \"Betty Crocker\", 1970[23] Fondue was popular in the United States in the 1960s and 1970s, along with other foods made in chafing dishes.[23] The extension of the name \"fondue\" to other dishes served in a communal hot pot dates to 1950s New York. Konrad Egli, a Swiss restaurateur, introduced fondue bourguignonne at his Chalet Suisse restaurant in 1956. In the mid-1960s, he invented chocolate fondue as part of a promotion for Toblerone chocolate.[24] Cheese fondue consists of a blend of cheeses, wine, and seasoning, although there are many variations, such as using beer rather than wine.[25] Traditionally, the caquelon is rubbed with a cut garlic clove, white wine is added and heated with cornstarch, and then grated cheese is added and gently stirred until melted, although in practice all the ingredients can be combined and heated together at once. Some kirsch is often added. Fondue is very easy to prepare, even in large quantities.[26] The cornstarch or other starch stabilizes and thickens the mixture. Additional wine may be added if the fondue is too thick; its acid and ethanol decrease the fondue's viscosity.  A fondue can curdle if the protein separates from the fat, which is usually the result of not enough liquid in the mixture and an insufficiently acid mixture, so lemon juice is sometimes added.[27] A cheese fondue mixture should be kept warm enough to keep the fondue smooth and liquid but not so hot that it burns. If this temperature is held until the fondue is finished there will be a thin crust of toasted (not burnt) cheese at the bottom of the caquelon. This is called la religieuse (French for the nun). It has the texture of a cracker and is almost always lifted out and eaten. The regional names used for some of these variants are factitious, and do not reflect genuine regional traditions.[18] Refrigerated fondue blends are sold in most Swiss supermarkets as convenience food and need little more than melting in the caquelon. Individual portions heatable in a microwave oven are also sold. Fondue is eaten by spearing a piece of bread on a fork, swirling it in the pot, and putting it into the mouth.[34] Some writers recommend that the dipping fork be used only to transport the food from the pot to one's plate, not to eat from.[35] Losing a piece of bread in the caquelon is said to be penalized by buying a round of drinks, singing a song, or running around in the snow naked.[24] This is parodied in Asterix in Switzerland, where a character is sentenced to be drowned in Lake Geneva after losing his third piece of bread.[36] Other fondue etiquette rules include 'always stirring in a figure of 8', 'not scratching the bottom of the caquelon with a fork that has no side on it' and 'adding an egg and kirsch schnapps to the caquelon when the cheese is almost finished' There are various recommendations on the choice of accompanying beverage: some say white wine, others specify black tea. Some drink spirits during or after the meal, which supposedly helps digestion. Indeed, alcohol may provide short-term relief, but overall, it delays gastric emptying and prolongs perceived fullness.[37] The delayed, strong feeling of fullness after eating fondue may be caused by phase separation in the stomach, the cheese fat initially floating in the stomach not being released into the duodenum, delaying fat sensing and satiation.[27]", "Jambalaya": "Jambalaya (/\u02ccd\u0292\u00e6mb\u0259\u02c8la\u026a\u0259/ JAM-b\u0259-LY-\u0259, /\u02ccd\u0292\u028cm-/ JUM-) is a savory rice dish of mixed origins that developed in the U.S. state of Louisiana apparently with African, Spanish, and French influences, consisting mainly of meat or seafood (or both),[1] and vegetables mixed with rice and spices. West Africans and Spanish people each had versions of jambalaya in their respective countries. Historian Ibraham Seck states Senegalese people were making jambalaya. The French introduced tomato to West Africans and they incorporated the food into their one-pot rice dishes that created jambalaya and jollof rice. Spanish people made paella which is also a one-pot rice dish cooked with meats and vegetables. These styles of cuisines blended in Louisiana and resulted in cultural and regional variations of the dish. The Oxford English Dictionary indicates that jambalaya comes from the Proven\u00e7al word jambalaia, meaning a mish mash, or mixup, and also meaning a pilaf (pilau) of rice. This is supported by the fact that the first printed appearance of the word is in a Proven\u00e7al poem published in 1837.[2] A folk etymology of the word suggests that it is the fusion of two Spanish words: jam\u00f3n (\"ham\") + paella (a rice dish). However, the evidence for this idea is thin. Ham is not a featured element of the dish, and Spanish speakers would call a ham paella paella con jam\u00f3n, not jam\u00f3n paella.[3][improper synthesis?] Another history, per Louisiana chef John Folse, author of The Encyclopedia of Cajun & Creole Cuisine (2004), is that jambalaya is a contraction of jambon \u00e0 la yaya, meaning \"ham with rice\", from French jambon and Yoruba yaya.[4] Jambalaya is a Creole/Cajun-American dish that originated in Africa and Europe and was brought to Louisiana during the colonial period.[5] These two cuisines blended in Louisiana; but also resulted in cultural and regional variations in how the dish is prepared.[6] There are a number of dishes with disparate origins that use some of the same ingredients. In West Africa there is a rice dish called \"jollof rice\" that according to researcher Kayla Stewart apparently developed from thi\u00e9boudienne, a Senegalese dish made of red rice, fish, cassava, and carrots.[7][8][9] Author Kelley Fanto Deetz also suggests jambalaya has roots in jollof rice.[10] In the records of slave narratives, formerly enslaved Black Americans made jambalaya. Historians who researched the records of slave narratives say they point to a possible Caribbean and African origin of the dish.[11] According to a Smithsonian Institution folklife article, jambalaya is a syncretic blend of West African, French, and Spanish influences. The territory of Louisiana was colonized by the French and Spanish during the colonial period and imported enslaved West Africans who had knowledge of rice cultivation. It is prepared and eaten in African-American, Cajun, and Creole communities. There are variations of how the dish is prepared within each community.[12][13] According to author James McCann, jambalaya has Creole, Cajun, West African, and Caribbean roots. In West Africa a dish similar to jambalaya is called dafa, which means to \"cook everything\". In West African cuisine, meat, fish and shellfish are all cooked in the same pot with rice to absorb juices from meats.[14] According to the Encyclopedia of African American History, the spicy flavor and heat of the dish points to a West African influence. The West Africans imported to Louisiana came from Senegambia which was a rice growing region. West Africans today still add spicy seasonings to their one-pot rice cooked meals.[15] According to research from Taharka Ad\u00e9, an associate professor in the Department of Africana Studies at San Diego State University, the French introduced the tomato (a food native to the Americas) to Senegambians and Akan people in the rice growing regions of West Africa and through this interaction West Africans created a dish called Jollof. Within the very same time frame a mix of west African people (which included Senegambians and Akan) living in southern Louisiana, and particularly New Orleans, created another rice and tomato based dish known as Jambalaya, denoting a shared relationship and underpinning West African influence on the creation of Jambalaya.[16] Author Ibraham Seck, director of research at the Whitney Plantation Slave Museum in St. John the Baptist Parish, suggests jambalaya originated on the Senegalese coast of West Africa. Senegalese people had knowledge of rice cultivation and created dishes using rice and meats that were brought to Louisiana during the era of the slave trade. About sixty percent of enslaved captives brought to Louisiana came from Senegambia.[17] An article from the United Nations states that the cuisines of Nigeria, Senegal, Guinea, and Benin influenced the development of jambalaya: \"Jambalaya (mixed rice, meat and vegetables), feijoada (black beans and meat), gombo(okra), and hopping johns (peas) are all dishes that have been re-adapted from Senegal, Nigeria, Guinea and Benin. You will find variations of these dishes in America and the Caribbean region.\"[18] Historian Karen Hess states jambalaya has French and Spanish influences. The French influence is from the dish pilau which is cooked with rice and seasoning. However, French pilau does not add seafood and meat which is typically done in Spanish Valencian paella, West African, and Caribbean cuisines.[19] The history of Jambalaya points to a West African influence. Rice was and is a traditional staple in West Africa, where one-pot mixed rice dishes such as thi\u00e9boudienne, benachin or Jollof rice were common.[20] In the records of slave narratives, formerly enslaved African Americans from Louisiana made jambalaya as a meal with rice, pork or chicken, red pepper, onion, lard, salt and pepper.[21] Black Americans adapted West African dishes in the Southern United States by using North American ingredients. These meals were prepared to survive during the era of slavery.[22] There is some folklore that claims jambalaya originates from the French Quarter of New Orleans, in the original sector[23] Some culinary scholars argue that it may have been a local version of the Spanish rice dish paella[24][1] French influence was strong in New Orleans, and native spices from Louisiana, the Gulf Coast and the Caribbean may have changed this pilaf or paella into a unique New World dish. As author and professor Judith Carney explains: \"...jambalaya resulted from cooking raw rice in the broth of stew composed of ingredients from many cultural heritages.\"[25] Traditionally, the meat includes sausage of some sort, often a smoked meat such as andouille, along with pork, chicken or seafood (less common), such as crawfish or shrimp. The vegetables are usually a sofrito-like mixture known as the \"trinity\" in Creole and Cajun cooking, consisting of onion, celery, and green bell pepper, though other vegetables such as okra, carrots, tomatoes, corn, chilis and garlic are also used. After browning and sauteing the meat and vegetables, rice is added with seasonings and broth, and the entire dish is cooked together until the rice is done. Jambalaya is similar to (but distinct from) other rice-and-meat dishes known in Louisiana cuisine such as gumbo and \u00e9touff\u00e9e. Gumbo uses similar sausages, meats, seafood, vegetables and seasonings. However, gumbo usually (though not always) includes fil\u00e9 powder or okra, which are not common in jambalaya. Gumbo is also usually served over white rice, which is prepared separately from the rest of the dish, unlike jambalaya, where the rice is prepared with the other ingredients.[26] \u00c9touff\u00e9e is a stew that always includes shellfish such as shrimp or crawfish but does not have the sausage common to jambalaya and gumbo. Also, like gumbo, \u00e9touff\u00e9e is usually served over separately prepared rice. There are two primary methods of making jambalaya, differentiated by the presence or absence of tomatoes. In narratives told by enslaved Black people, their ancestors made jambalaya. According to some historians, jambalaya was prepared and eaten in West Africa using tomatoes introduced to West Africans by the French. Rice dishes with meats and vegetables cooked in one pot with spices is a common meal in West Africa. During the slave trade, about sixty percent of enslaved people brought to Louisiana were Senegalese. They brought Senegalese cuisine to Louisiana which already had a version of jambalaya. Jambalaya in Louisiana's Black communities incorporates tomatoes, and meats. In rural south Louisiana, jambalaya is brown from absorbing the sauce it is cooked in, as it is traditionally cooked in cast-iron pots, which reach high cooking temperatures, \"resulting in a more complete caramelization of the natural sugars in meats and vegetables\". Enslaved Africans served this dish to their French and Spanish slaveholders, resulting in a fusion of the dish as Spanish people had a dish similar  to jambalaya called paella.[27][28] Jollof rice from West African cuisine influenced the jambalaya made in African-American communities.[29] A modern variation of jambalaya was documented in an African-American cookbook. This jambalaya dish used ham and sausage, tomatoes and tomato sauce, and was seasoned with spices and bell pepper and other ingredients cooked in a pot.[30] The second style, more characteristic of southwestern and south-central Louisiana, is Cajun jambalaya, which contains no tomatoes (the idea being the farther away from New Orleans one gets, the less common tomatoes are in dishes). The meat is browned in a cast-iron pot. The bits of meat that stick to the bottom of the pot (sucs) are what give a Cajun jambalaya its brown color. A little vegetable oil is added if there is not enough fat in the pot. The trinity (of 50% onions, 25% celery, and 25% green or red bell pepper, although proportions can be altered to suit one's taste) is added and saut\u00e9ed until soft. Stock and seasonings are added in the next step, and then the meats are returned to the pot. This mixture is then simmered, covered, for at least one hour. Lastly, the mixture is brought to a boil and rice is added to the pot. It is then covered and left to simmer over very low heat for at least 1/2 hour without stirring. The dish is finished when the rice has cooked. In some Cajun kitchens, jambalaya is made with seasoned sausage or ham, rice, parsley, stock and spices and put in a pot and cooked with rice until done, and sometimes prepared with cooked rice.[31] The first is Creole jambalaya (also called \"red jambalaya\") because it is made with tomatoes. First, meat is added to the trinity of celery, peppers, and onions; the meat is usually chicken and sausage such as andouille or smoked sausage. Next, vegetables and tomatoes, which are added to cook, followed by seafood. Rice and stock are added in equal proportions at the very end. The mixture is brought to a boil and left to simmer for 20 to 60 minutes, depending on the recipe, with infrequent stirring. Towards the end of the cooking process, stirring usually ceases. Some versions call for the jambalaya to be baked after the cooking of all the ingredients. In some Creole kitchens, jambalaya is made with smoked chaudin (ponce) and in Cajun kitchens is made with crawfish.[32] Some cooks note the regional variations of jambalaya. Authors Abby Fisher and Karen Hess stated Creole New Orleans jambalaya is \"soupy.\" While other variations of jambalaya are dry.[33] In modern Louisiana, the dish has evolved along a variety of different lines. New Orleans style jambalaya, called \"red jambalaya\" in Acadiana, is found primarily in and around New Orleans, where it is known simply as \"jambalaya\". It is called red jambalaya because it is made with tomatoes. New Orleans style jambalaya includes tomatoes, whereas Acadiana style jambalaya usually does not. Acadiana style jambalaya originates from Louisiana's rural, low-lying swamp country where crawfish, shrimp, oysters, alligator, duck, turtle, boar, venison, nutria[34] and other game were readily available. Any variety or combination of meats, including chicken or turkey, may be used to make jambalaya. Acadiana style jambalaya is known as \"brown jambalaya\" in the Greater New Orleans area (except for the lower Westbank where it can be found among some families); to folks from Acadiana it is simply known as \"jambalaya\".[35] Many people in the south, and typically in Louisiana, enjoy a simpler jambalaya style. This style is cooked the same as the Cajun style, but there are no vegetables. Many restaurants serve this style as opposed to the others, because it is more child-friendly, has a more consistent texture, and is easier to make. Jambalaya is considered by most Louisianans to be a filling but simple-to-prepare rice dish; gumbos, \u00e9touff\u00e9es, and creoles are considered more difficult to perfect. Most often a long grain white rice is used in making jambalaya. Jambalaya is differentiated from gumbo and \u00e9touff\u00e9e by the way in which the rice is included. In these dishes, the rice is cooked separately and is served as a bed on which the main dish is served. In the usual method of preparing jambalaya, a rich stock is created from vegetables, meat and seafood; raw rice is then added to the broth and the flavor is absorbed by the grains as the rice cooks. In a less common method, meats and vegetables are cooked separately from the rice. At the same time, rice is cooked in a savory stock. It is added to the meat and vegetables before serving. This is called \"white jambalaya\". This dish is rare in Louisiana as it is seen as a \"quick\" attempt to make jambalaya, popularized outside the state to shorten cooking time. The first appearance in print of any variant of the word 'jambalaya' in any language occurred in Leis amours de Vanus; vo, Lou paysan oou th\u00e9\u00e2tr\u00e9, by Fortun\u00e9 (Fortunat) Chailan, first published in Proven\u00e7al dialect in 1837. The earliest appearance of the word in print in English occurs in the May 1849 issue of the American Agriculturalist, page 161, where Solon Robinson refers to a recipe for \"Hopping Johnny (jambalaya)\", however he made a mistake in identifying jambalaya as \"Hopping Johnny\", which is an entirely different dish with different origins and different birth state. Jambalaya did not appear in a cookbook until 1878,[36] when the Gulf City Cook Book, by the ladies of the St. Francis Street Methodist Episcopal Church, was printed in South Mobile, Alabama. It contains a recipe for \"JAM BOLAYA\".[37] Jambalaya had a brief jump in popularity during the 1920s and 1930s because of its flexible recipe. The dish was little more than the rice and vegetables the populace could afford; the recipe grew from humble roots. In 1968, Louisiana Governor John J. McKeithen proclaimed Gonzales, Louisiana, \"the Jambalaya capital of the world\". Every spring, the annual Jambalaya Festival is held in Gonzales.[38] ", "Pavlova": "Pavlova may refer to:", "Sauerbraten": "Sauerbraten (pronounced [\u02c8za\u028a\u032f\u0250\u02ccb\u0281a\u02d0tn\u0329] \u24d8) is a traditional German roast of heavily marinated meat. It is regarded as a national dish of Germany, and is frequently served in German-style restaurants internationally.[1] It can be cooked from a variety of meats, most often from beef, but also from chicken, lamb and mutton, pork and horse.[2][3][4] Before cooking, the raw meat is marinated for 5 to 15 days in a mixture of wine or vinegar, water, herbs, spices, and seasonings.  Usually, tougher cuts of meat, such as rump roast or bottom round of beef, are used, and the long marinating tenderizes the meat. A Sauerbraten dinner is almost always accompanied by a hearty gravy resulting from its roasting and is most often served with potato pancakes (Kartoffelpuffer),  potato dumplings (Kartoffelkl\u00f6\u00dfe), or Sp\u00e4tzle.[5] Ingredients used in the marinade, and accompaniments served with sauerbraten, vary across regions. Regional variants of the dish include those from Baden, Franconia, Thuringia, Rhineland, Saarland, Silesia, and Swabia.[2] The name \"Sauerbraten\" is of German origin, and is derived from Sauer meaning \"sour\" or \"pickled\" and Braten meaning \"roast meat\", thus \"sour roast\".[6] Julius Caesar has been assigned a role in the inspiration for sauerbraten as he sent amphoras filled with beef marinated in wine over the Alps to the newly founded Roman colony of Cologne. According to this legend, this inspired the residents of Cologne to imitate the Roman import.[7] While quite common, these claims are largely unsubstantiated. Several sources believe sauerbraten was invented by Charlemagne in the 9th century AD as a means of using leftover roasted meat.[8][9] Saint Albertus Magnus, also known as Saint Albert the Great and Albert of Cologne, is also credited with popularizing the dish in the 13th century.[10][unreliable source?] Horse meat was not originally used for the dish, although it has become commonly used in restaurants in the Rhineland. Most other areas in which the dish is found currently use beef.[3][11] There are many regional variants of sauerbraten.  Many of the variations are in the ingredients used for the marinade in which the cut of meat is immersed for several days before cooking. Generally, the marinade's base is either red wine, vinegar, or a combination of both. While Germany largely produces white wines such as Riesling and Gew\u00fcrztraminer, regions of Germany that are closer to France often use red wine as the base for the marinade. Wine vinegar, apple cider vinegar and other varieties can be used as a base. Recipes from eastern regions of Germany closer to Poland and the Czech Republic tend to use vinegar as the base more frequently. In many regions, wine and vinegar are used together. Sauerbraten can be made with many different kinds of roasting meat.  Tougher, less expensive cuts of meat are used\u2014typically a rump roast or bottom round of beef. Venison or other game is often prepared as sauerbraten as the spices and vinegar take away the gamey taste of the meat.[8] A solid cut from the bottom round[12] or rump is marinated for three or four days,[13] or as many as ten,[14] before cooking. Red wine vinegar and wine typically form the basis of the marinade, which also includes earthy aromatic spices such as peppercorns, juniper berries, cloves, nutmeg, and bay leaves and less commonly coriander, mustard seed, cinnamon, mace, ginger, and thyme.[3][15][16] The marinade may also include vegetables such as onions, celery, and carrots.[13] The acidic marinade helps tenderize the meat before it cooks. Buttermilk is also used as a marinade in certain regional varieties.[5][17]\nIt is frequently advised to marinate the meat in an earthenware, glass, plastic, or enamel container rather than one made of bare metal, as the acidic marinade would react with a metal vessel during the extended marinating. After the meat is removed from the marinade and dried, it is first browned in oil or lard and then braised with the strained marinade in a covered dish in a medium oven or on the stovetop. After simmering for four hours or more, depending on the size of the roast, the marinade will continue to flavor the roast and, as the meat cooks, its juices will also be released resulting in a very tender roast. After the roast is cooked, the marinade is strained and returned to a saucepan where it is thickened (often with crushed gingerbread, lebkuchen \u2013 in particular Aachener Printen \u2013, or gingersnaps, flour, sour cream, brown sugar, and/or roux)[3][18] which add body and flavor to the sauce. Before it closed in 1982, L\u00fcchow's German restaurant in New York City used crushed gingersnap cookies to season and thicken the gravy of its sauerbraten, one of the favored dishes.[5][19] This style was made popular in the U.S. after the publication of Luchow's German Cookbook: The Story and the Favorite Dishes of America's Most Famous German Restaurant by Jan Mitchell in 1952.[13] Packaged sauerbraten seasonings are available. Cooked sauerbraten in marinade is sold in some supermarkets. While sauerbraten is most traditionally eaten with beer,[20] it pairs well with the following wine varietals: Burgundy,[21] Cabernet Franc, Cabernet Sauvignon, Gew\u00fcrztraminer, Pinot noir, Riesling, and Syrah.[22][unreliable source?]", "Tom Yum Soup": " Tom yum or tom yam (UK:  /\u02cct\u0252m \u02c8j\u00e6m, - \u02c8j\u028cm/, US: /- \u02c8j\u0251\u02d0m/;[3] Thai: \u0e15\u0e49\u0e21\u0e22\u0e33, RTGS:\u00a0tom yam [t\u00f4m j\u0101m] \u24d8) is a family of hot and sour Thai soups. The strong, hot, and sour flavors make it very popular in Thai cuisine.[4]  The name \"tom yam\" is composed of two Thai words. Tom refers to the boiling process, while yam means 'mixed'.\nHistorian Giles Milton contends that the origins of Tom Yum can be traced back to India, where there is a variation of hot and sour shrimp soup known as \"sour prawn soup\". In Thailand, Tom Yam is available in various types, with the most popular being \u201cTom Yam Nam Khon,\u201d or Creamy Tom Yam Soup, and \u201cTom Yam Nam Sai,\u201d or Clear Tom Yam Soup. This soup features a variety of main ingredients, including shrimp, pork, chicken, and seafood. [5] The soup base depends on the exact sub-type but is generally water, coconut milk, or chicken or other broth.[6] Various aromatic ingredients are sliced, roughly pounded, and simmered to extract their flavor.  These include fresh ingredients such as lemongrass, kaffir lime leaves, galangal, chilis, shallots, and garlic.  For shrimp-based soups, shrimp shells and heads may also be simmered, to extract their flavor.  These ingredients are often then removed as their flavor is now extracted and many aren't edible.  However they may be left in, as an aid to presentation.[6] Alternatively, commercial tom yum paste may be used.  This is made by crushing all the herb ingredients and stir-frying them in oil, then adding seasoning and other preservative ingredients. The paste is bottled or packaged and sold around the world. Vegetables, such as onion and tomato, are then added. In modern popular versions the soup may also contain mushrooms\u2014usually straw mushrooms or oyster mushrooms.[6] Various meats are added next, commonly fish, shrimp, mixed seafood, pork, or chicken.[6] When the meat is cooked, final flavorings whose taste is destroyed by heat, such as fish sauce and lime juice, are added.  For most varieties a paste called nam phrik phao (Thai: \u0e19\u0e49\u0e33\u0e1e\u0e23\u0e34\u0e01\u0e40\u0e1c\u0e32) is also added, made from shrimp, chilis, shallots, and garlic.[7]  This imparts sweet, salty, and spicy tastes.[6] Yet other ingredients may also be used, depending on the exact variety of tom yam, such as evaporated milk.[6] The soup is often topped with a generous sprinkling of fresh chopped coriander leaves, and may be served over a serving of rice.[6] Less well known outside Thailand is tom khlong (\u0e15\u0e49\u0e21\u0e42\u0e04\u0e25\u0e49\u0e07), a spicy sour soup where the sourness does not derive from lime juice but through the use of tamarind.[16] Tom som (Thai: \u0e15\u0e49\u0e21\u0e2a\u0e49\u0e21) are soups that are also very similar to tom yum but most often do not contain lemongrass or kaffir lime leaves. Depending on the type of tom som, the acidity can be derived from lime juice or from the use of tamarind.[17][18] Tom yum, locally spelled as tomyam, is very well-received among Malaysians since its introduction around the 1980s.[19][20] The cuisine is now considered a must-have on most restaurant menus in Malaysia, especially the peninsular states.[20] As of 2018, the popularity of tom yum and other Thai dishes had brought employment to at least 120,000 south Thai cooks, working restaurants mainly in Selangor state and the capital city of Kuala Lumpur, and owning 5000 to 6000 Thai restaurants throughout the country.[20][19] Hot", "Tandoori Chicken": " Tandoori chicken is a dish made from chicken marinated in yogurt and spices and roasted in a tandoor, a cylindrical clay oven. The dish is now popular worldwide. The modern form of the dish was popularized by the Moti Mahal restaurant in New Delhi, India in the late 1940s. Chicken roasted in tandoor-like ovens is documented in the Harappan civilization of the Bronze Age of Indian subcontinent, as early as 3000 BC.[10][11][12][13][14][15] Much later, the Sushruta Samhita records meat being cooked in an oven (kandu) after being seasoned with black mustard (rai) powder and fragrant spices. Tandoori chicken as a dish originated in the Punjab before the independence of partition of India.[16][17] In the late 1940s, tandoori chicken was popularised at Moti Mahal in the locality of Daryaganj[18][19] in New Delhi by Kundan Lal Jaggi, Kundan Lal Gujral and Thakur Das Magu, who were Punjabi Hindu migrants from Peshawar[20][21][22][23][24] as well as the founders of the Moti Mahal restaurant.[1][2][3][4][23] They used to work at a small eatery called Moti Mahal, owned by a man named Mokha Singh Lamba in Peshawar, British India, from the 1920s to 1947.[5][6][25] Tandoori chicken was popularized in post-independence India by Moti Mahal, Daryaganj in Delhi[26][27] when it was served to the first Prime Minister of India, Jawaharlal Nehru.[28] There, tandoori chicken became a standard offering at official banquets.[28] In the United States, tandoori chicken began appearing on menus by the 1960s. Jacqueline Kennedy was reported to have eaten \"chicken tandoori\" on a flight from Rome to Bombay in 1962.[29] A recipe for tandoori chicken was printed in the Los Angeles Times in 1963, for \"the hostess in search of a fresh idea for a party dinner\";[30] a similar recipe was featured in the same newspaper in 1964.[31] Raw chicken parts are skinned then marinated in a mixture of dahi (yogurt) and tandoori masala, a spice blend. They are seasoned and colored with cayenne pepper, red chili powder, or Kashmiri red chili powder as well as turmeric or food coloring.[a] The marinated chicken is placed on skewers and cooked at high temperatures in a tandoor oven, which is heated with charcoal or wood, which adds to the smoky flavour. The dish can also be cooked in a standard oven, using a spit or rotisserie, or over hot charcoal.[32] There are also tandoori recipes for whole chicken, some of which are cooked in a tandoor and others over charcoal. These include Chirga (Roasted whole chicken); Tandoori Murgh (Roast whole chicken with almonds); Murgh Kabab Seekhi (Whole stuffed chicken on the spit); Kookarh Tandoori (Steamed chicken on spit); Tandoori Murgh Massaledarh (Whole spiced chicken on spit); and Murghi Bhogar (Chicken in the Bhogar style).[33] Tandoori chicken can be eaten as a starter or appetizer, or as a main course, often served with naan flatbread.[34] It is also used as the base of numerous cream-based curries, such as butter chicken.[35] The fame of tandoori chicken led to many derivatives, such as chicken tikka (and eventually the Indian dish popularized in Britain, chicken tikka masala), commonly found in menus in Indian restaurants all over the world.[36] Nearly all derivatives of tandoori chicken begin with a yogurt and citrus-based marinade.[37][38]", "Shami Kebab": " Shami kabab or shaami kabab is a local variety of kebab, originating from the Lucknow region of the Indian subcontinent developed during the Mughal rule. It is a popular dish in modern-day Indian, Pakistani and Bangladeshi cuisines.[1] It is composed of a small patty of minced meat, generally beef, but occasionally lamb or mutton (a chicken version exists as well), with ground chickpeas, egg to hold it together, and spices. Shami kebab is eaten as a snack or an appetizer, and is served to guests especially in the regions of Dhaka, Deccan, Punjab, Kashmir, Uttar Pradesh and Sindh. They are often garnished with lemon juice and served with sliced raw onions as a side salad, and may be eaten with chutney made from mint or coriander.[2] They are also served along with sheer khurma during the celebrations of the Islamic festival of Eid. Shami kababs are boiled or sauteed meat (beef or lamb) and chickpeas (chana daal) with whole hot spices (garam masala, black pepper, cinnamon, cloves, bay leaves), whole ginger, whole garlic and some salt to taste until completely tender. Onions, turmeric, chili powder, egg, chopped green coriander, chopped green chillies and chopped mint leaves may be added in preparing kebab. Garam masala powder (ground spices) may be used in place of whole hot spices.[3] The cooked meat is then ground in such a way that it is fibrous and does not become a paste. It is then shaped into diamond or round patties and is shallow fried. The Kashmiri variation uses a proportion of 3 parts mutton to 1 part lentils (chana) and is cooked and then ground to a paste consistency before frying the patties to a brown outer crust while keeping the inner soft. Shami kebabs may be served with roti along with ketchup, hot sauce, Schezwan sauce, chilli garlic sauce, raita or chutney. Before serving the kebabs, it is also common to dip them in a beaten egg mixture and double-fry them. They are also commonly eaten in Hyderabad with cooked rice or chapati. There are several etymological explanations behind the shami kebab. One explanation is that the name of the dish derives from the word shaam, which means \"dinner\" and \"night\" in Persian. It also means evening in Urdu and Hindi. The name may also derive from the scent of an itr called shamama.[4] The name shami kebab may also refer to Bilad al-Sham, the modern Syria, as many cooks from that region migrated to the wealthy Mughal Empire of South Asia during the Middle Ages.", "Chicken Korma": "Korma or qorma (Urdu: \u0642\u0648\u0631\u0645\u06c1; Hindi: \u0915\u093c\u094b\u0930\u092e\u093e; Bengali: \u0995\u09cb\u09b0\u09ae\u09be); Persian: \u0642\u0631\u0645\u0627); is a dish with its origin in the Indian subcontinent,[1] consisting of meat or vegetables braised with yogurt, water or stock, and spices to produce a thick sauce or gravy.[2] The English name is an anglicisation of the Hindi-Urdu qorm\u0101 (\u0915\u093c\u094b\u0930\u092e\u093e, \u0642\u0648\u0631\u0645\u06c1), meaning \"braise\".[3][4] It refers to the cooking technique used in the dish.[2][5] All these words, and the names of dishes such as the Iranian ghormeh (Persian: \u0642\u0648\u0631\u0645\u0647), Turkish Kavurma and the Azerbaijani qovurma or kavarma, are ultimately derived from a Turkic word qawirma, meaning \"[a] fried thing\".[4] The Indian korma is, however, possibly unrelated in a culinary sense to the modern Turkish kavurma or to some other dishes using the same root word, as they use widely varying techniques and ingredients.[6] Korma has its roots in the Mughlai cuisine[1] of the Indian subcontinent. A characteristic Mughal dish, it can be traced back to the 16th century and to the Mughal expansion into South Asia. Kormas were often prepared in the Mughal court kitchens, such as the famous white korma, perhaps garnished with vark, was said to have been served to Shah Jahan and his guests at the inauguration of the Taj Mahal.[7] Classically, a korma is defined as a dish where meat or vegetables are braised with yogurt or stock. The technique covers many different styles of korma. The flavour of a korma is based on the mixture of spices, including ground coriander and cumin, combined with yogurt kept below curdling temperature and incorporated slowly and carefully with the meat juices. Traditionally, this would have been carried out in a pot set over a very low fire, with charcoal on the lid to provide all-round heat. A korma can be mildly spiced or fiery and may use lamb, goat meat, chicken, beef or game; some kormas combine meat and vegetables, such as spinach and turnip. The term shahi (English: royal), used for some kormas, indicates its status as a prestige dish, rather than an everyday meal, and its association with the court. The korma style is similar to other braising techniques in that the meat or vegetable is first cooked briskly, or seared, using high heat, traditionally with ghee, and then subjected to long, slow cooking using moist heat and a minimum of added liquid.[2] The pot may be sealed with dough during the last stages of cooking, using a technique called dum or dampokhtak.[2] The korma is made using a technique called bagar. in the later stage of cooking, additional spices are mixed with heated ghee and then combined with the sauce formed by the braising. The pan is then covered and shaken to release steam and mix the contents.[8] There is a wide variation between individual korma and other \"curry\" recipes. Chilli and ginger are often used, but the precise method of preparation results in widely different flavors. Indian bay leaves or dried coconut may be added, the latter being a predominantly South Indian flavoring. A korma pilau (pilaf) is a rice and meat dish made with braised meat.[9] In the United Kingdom, a typical korma as served in curry houses is a mildly spiced dish with a thick sauce. It often features almonds, cashews or other nuts, and coconut or coconut milk. In the 21st century, chicken korma has several times been cited as the most popular curry in the UK, replacing chicken tikka masala in surveys of public eating habits.[10][11] Navratan korma is a vegetarian korma made with vegetables and either paneer (an Indian cheese) or nuts \u2013 or sometimes both.[12] Navratan means \"nine gems\", and it is common for the recipe to include nine different vegetables. In some parts of South Asia, korma is used to denote a traditional Eid al-Adha (festival of the sacrifice) dish of lamb, goat, or cow that is braised in minimal or no spices. The flavour comes from the meat and fat of the chosen cuts. It was often done to preserve meats for a short-term period, as the fat layer forms a barrier to help prevent spoilage, similar to potted beef. In Malaysia, korma or 'gulai kurma' is traditionally cooked with coconut milk instead of yoghurt among the Malays, as dairy products do not feature heavily in Malay cuisine. Meats used for kurma include chicken, mutton, beef, and deer. It also often contains more vegetables, such as carrots, potatoes, and tomatoes, though this is not a hard-and-fast rule. Some recipes include tamarind as the souring agent, in place of the natural acidity of yoghurt.[13]", "Chicken Biryani": " Biryani (/b\u025c\u02d0r\u02c8j\u0251\u02d0ni/) is a mixed rice dish, mainly popular in South Asia. It is made with rice, some type of meat (chicken, goat, lamb, beef, prawn, or fish) and spices. To cater to vegetarians, in some cases, it is prepared by substituting vegetables or paneer for the meat.[1] Sometimes eggs and/or potatoes are also added.[2] Biryani is one of the most popular dishes in South Asia and among the South Asian diaspora, although the dish is often associated with the region's Muslim population in particular.[3] Similar dishes are also prepared in other parts of the world such as in Iraq, Myanmar, Thailand, and Malaysia.[4] Biryani is the single most-ordered dish on Indian online food ordering and delivery services, and has been labelled as the most popular dish overall in India.[3][5] One theory states that it originated from birinj (Persian: \u0628\u0631\u0646\u062c), the Persian word for rice.[6][7] Another theory states that it is derived from biryan or beriyan (Persian: \u0628\u0631\u06cc\u0627\u0646), which means \"to fry\" or \"to roast\".[8][9] It may alternatively be related to the Persian word bereshtan (Persian: \u0628\u0631\u0634\u062a\u0646) which also means \"to roast (onions)\", as the dish is often prepared by flavouring rice with fried onions and meat, besides mild spices. The exact origin of the dish is uncertain, however, it is speculated to have originated in Iran. In North India, different varieties of biryani developed.[6][10] According to historian Lizzie Collingham, the modern biryani developed in the royal kitchens of the Mughal Empire (1526\u20131857) and is a mix of the native spicy rice dishes of India and the Persian polao.[11] Indian restaurateur Kris Dhillon believes that the dish originated in Persia and was brought to India by the Mughals.[12] Salma Hossein, whom the BBC regards as the \"doyenne of Islamic cooking in India\", shares a similar view, asserting that biryani came to India from Persia even before the Mughal era. Food scholar Pushpesh Pant also challenges the Mughal-origin claim, stating that it originated in Iran and that \"there is no evidence that biryani first came to this land with the Mughals. It is far more probable that it travelled with pilgrims and soldier-statesmen of noble descent to the Deccan region in South India\".[13] Another theory claims that the dish was prepared in India before the first Mughal emperor Babur conquered India.[14] The 16th-century Mughal text Ain-i-Akbari makes no distinction between biryanis and pilaf (or pulao): it states that the word \"biryani\" is of older usage in India.[citation needed][15] A similar theory, that biryani came to India with Timur's invasion, appears to be incorrect because there is no record of biryani having existed in his native land during that period.[14] According to Pratibha Karan, who wrote the book Biryani, biryani is of Mughal origin, derived from pilaf varieties brought to the Indian subcontinent by Arab traders. She speculates that the pulao was an army dish in medieval India. Armies would prepare a one-pot dish of rice with whichever meat was available. Over time, the dish became biryani due to different methods of cooking, with the distinction between \"pulao\" and \"biryani\" being arbitrary.[6][14] According to Vishwanath Shenoy, the owner of a biryani restaurant chain in India, one branch of biryani comes from the Mughals, while another was brought by the Arab traders to Malabar in South India.[16] There are various apocryphal stories dating the invention to Shah Jahan's time but Rana Safvi, the distinguished historian, says she could only find a recipe from the later Mughal period, from Bahadur Shah Zafar's time. It is not her claim that there was no biryani before that; just that she has not found a recipe. Other historians who have gone through texts say that the first references to biryani only appear around the 18th century.[17] Some claim that the dish \"oonchoru\" as mentioned in Sangam literature, which dates from between 200 BCE and 200 CE, is a predecessor of modern biryani. This dish, which was served to the soldiers of the Chera kings in Kerala, was said to be made of rice, ghee, meat, turmeric, coriander, pepper, and bay leaf.[18][19][20] The spices used in the preparation of South Indian biryanis, such as those used in the Malabar variety, are distinctive to the region and the Western Ghats. These spices are not found in the Middle East, Persia, or North India, underscoring the unique culinary heritage and local ingredients of South Indian biryani.[18][19][20] In South India, where rice is more widely used as a staple food, several distinct varieties of biryani emerged from Hyderabad in Telangana, Vijayawada in Andhra Pradesh, Mangalore and Bhatkal in Coastal Karnataka, Thalassery and Kozhikode in Malabar Kerala, as well as Ambur and Chettinad in Tamil Nadu.[6][10] Pilaf or pulao, as it is known on the Indian subcontinent, is another mixed rice dish popular in the cuisines of the Indian subcontinent, Central Asia, and Middle Eastern cuisine. Opinions differ on the differences between pulao and biryani, and whether actually there is a difference between the two.[21] According to Delhi-based historian Sohail Hashmi, pulao tends to be plainer than biryani, and consists of meat or vegetables cooked with rice with the bottom layered with potatoes or onions. Biryani contains more gravy (or yakhni), and is often cooked longer, leaving the meat (and vegetables, if present) more tender, and the rice more flavoured. Biryani is also cooked with additional dressings and often would have a light layer of scorched rice at the bottom.[22] Author Pratibha Karan states that while the terms are often applied arbitrarily, the main distinction is that a biryani consists of two layers of rice with a layer of meat (and vegetables, if present) in the middle, while the pulao is not layered.[14] Author Colleen Taylor Sen lists the following distinctions between biryani and pulao:[23] Ingredients for biryani vary according to the region and the type of meat and vegetables used. Meat (chicken, goat, beef, lamb,[26] prawn or fish) is the prime ingredient with rice. As is common in dishes of the Indian subcontinent, vegetables are sometimes also used when preparing biryani. Corn may be used, depending on the season and availability. Navratan biryani tends to use sweeter, richer ingredients such as cashews, sultanas (kismis), and fruits such as apples and pineapples.[22] The spices and condiments used in biryani may include fennel seeds, ghee (clarified butter), nutmeg, mace,[27] pepper, cloves,[27] cardamom, cinnamon, bay leaves, coriander, mint, ginger, onions, tomatoes, green chilies,[26] star anise, and garlic. The premium varieties include saffron.[27] Some commercial recipes for Biryani also include aromatic essences such as Mitha Ittar see attar, kewra and rose water. Dried sour prunes (Alu Bukhara) may also be added to the biryani. In nasi briyani and other variants made in Southeast Asian countries such as Malaysia, Singapore, and Indonesia, typical Southeast Asian spices and aromatics such as pandan leaf may be used alongside typical South Asian spices.[28] The main ingredient that usually accompanies the spices is chicken, lamb or goat meat; special varieties might use beef or seafood instead. The dish may be served with dahi chutney or raita, seekh kebab, korma, curry, a sour dish of aubergine (brinjal), boiled egg, and salad. Biryani can be cooked using one of two styles/techniques, pakki (\"cooked\") and kacchi (\"raw\").[29] There are many types of biryani, whose names are often based on their region of origin. For example, Sindhi biryani developed in the Sindh region of what is now Pakistan, and Hyderabadi biryani developed in the city of Hyderabad in South India. Some have taken the name of the shop that sells it, for example: Haji Biriyani, Haji Nanna Biriyani in Old Dhaka,[30] Fakhruddin Biriyani in Dhaka,[31][32] Students biryani in Karachi, Lucky biryani in Bandra, Mumbai and Baghdadi biryani in Colaba, Mumbai.[22] Biryanis are often specific to the Muslim communities where they originate; they are usually the defining dishes of those communities.[33] Ambur/Vaniyambadi biryani is a variety cooked in the neighboring towns of Ambur and Vaniyambadi in the Tirupattur district of the northeastern part of Tamil Nadu, which has a high Muslim population. It was introduced by the Nawabs of Arcot who once ruled the area. It is typically made with jeera samba rice.[34] The Ambur/Vaniyambadi biryani is accompanied by dhalcha, a sour brinjal curry, and pachadi or raitha (sliced onions mixed with plain yogurt, tomato, chilies, and salt). It has a distinctive aroma and is considered light on the stomach. The usage of spice is moderate, and curd is used as a gravy base. It also has a higher ratio of meat to rice.[15] Ambur-style biriyani is popular as street food all across South India. Beef biryani, as the name implies, uses beef as the meat. In Hyderabad, it is famous as Kalyani biryani, in which buffalo or cow meat is used.[35][36] This meal was started after the Kalyani Nawabs of Bidar came to Hyderabad sometime in the 18th century. The Kalyani biryani is made with small cubes of beef, regular spices, onions, and many tomatoes. It has a distinct tomato, jeera and dhania flavour.[37] In Kerala, beef biryani is well known.[38] This is an integral part of the Navayath cuisine and a specialty of Bhatkal, a coastal town in Karnataka. Its origins are traced to the Persian traders who left behind not only biryani but a variation of kababs and Indian breads. In Bhatkali biryani, the meat is cooked in an onion and green chili-based masala and layered with fragrant rice. It has a unique spicy and heady flavour, and the rice is overwhelmingly white with mild streaks of orange. Its variations include beef, goat, chicken, titar (Partridge), egg, fish, crab, prawn, and vegetable biryani. Though similar to those in Thalassery, this biryani differs with lingering after-notes of mashed onions laced with garlic. A few chilies and spices littered with curry leaves lends a unique flavour to Bhatkal biryani. No oil is used.[39] Bohri biryani, prepared by the Bohris is flavoured with lots of tomatoes.[16] It is popular in Karachi. Chettinad biryani is famous in the Indian state of Tamil Nadu. It is made of jeeraka samba rice, and smells of spices and ghee. It is best taken with nenju elumbu kuzhambu, a spicy and tangy goat meat gravy [citation needed]. The podi kozhi is usually topped with fried onions and curry leaves.[40][41][42][43] Degh ki biryani is a typical biryani made from small cubes of beef or mutton. This biryani is famous in Parbhani and generally served at weddings. The meat is flavoured with ginger, garlic, red chili, cumin, garam masala, fried onion and curd. This biryani is also known as kachay gosht ki biryani or dum biryani, where the meat is marinated and cooked along with short-grained and fine rice. It is left on a slow fire or dum for a fragrant and aromatic flavour. The Delhi version of biryani developed a unique local flavour as the Mughal kings shifted their political capital to the North Indian city of Delhi. Until the 1950s, most people cooked biryani in their home and rarely ate at eateries outside of their homes. Hence, restaurants primarily catered to travellers and merchants. Any region that saw more of these two classes of people nurtured more restaurants, and thus their own versions of biryani. This is the reason why most shops that sold biryani in Delhi, tended to be near mosques such as Jama Masjid (for travellers) or traditional shopping districts (such as Chandni Chowk). Each part of Delhi has its own style of biryani, often based on its original purpose, thus giving rise to Nizamuddin biryani, Shahjahanabad biryani, etc.  Nizamuddin biryani usually had little expensive meat and spices as it was primarily meant to be made in bulk for offering at the Nizamuddin Dargah shrine and thereafter to be distributed to devotees.[22] A non-dum biryani, using many green chillies, popularized by the Babu Shahi Bawarchi shops located outside the National Sports Club in Delhi is informally called Babu Shahi biryani. Another version of Delhi biryani uses achaar (pickles) and is called achaari biryani.[44] The city of Dhaka in Bangladesh is known for selling Chevon Biryani, a dish made with highly seasoned rice and goat meat. The recipe includes: highly seasoned rice, goat meat, mustard oil, garlic, onion, black pepper, saffron, clove, cardamom, cinnamon, salt, lemon, doi, peanuts, cream, raisins and a small amount of cheese (either from cows or buffalo). Haji biryani is a favourite among Bangladeshis living abroad.[45] A recipe was handed down by the founder of one Dhaka restaurant to the next generation. Haji Mohammad Shahed claimed, \"I have never changed anything, not even the amount of salt\".[46] Bengali style biryani often includes potatoes. Dhakaiya Kacchi Biryani is accompanied by borhani, a salted mint drink made of yogurt, coriander, mint and salt. The city of Dindigul in Tamil Nadu is noted for its biryani, which uses a little curd and lemon juice for a tangy taste.[47] Military hotels of Bangalore in Karnataka are known for selling Biryani served in dried plantain leaf bowl called Donne.[48] It is typically made from jeera samba rice, yogurt with lot of common mint and coriander leaves.[49][50] Hyderabadi biryani is India's most famous biryani; some say biryani is synonymous with Hyderabad.[51] Hyderabadi biryani developed under the rule of Asaf Jah I, who was first appointed as the governor of Deccan by the Mughal Emperor Aurangzeb. It is made with basmati rice, spices and goat meat. Popular variations use chicken instead of goat meat. There are various forms of Hyderabadi biryani, such as kachay gosht ki biryani or dum biryani, where goat meat is marinated and cooked along with the rice. It is left on a slow fire or dum for a fragrant and aromatic flavour.[52] Memoni biryani is an extremely spicy variety developed by the Memons of Gujarat-Sindh region in India and Pakistan.[16] It is made with mutton, dahi, fried onions, and potatoes, and fewer tomatoes compared to Sindhi biryani. Kalyani biryani is a typical biryani from the former state of Hyderabad Deccan.[53] Also known as the \"poor man's\"  Hyderabadi biryani, Kalyani biryani is always made from small cubes of buffalo meat. The meat is flavoured with ginger, garlic, turmeric, red chili, cumin, coriander powder, and much onion and tomato. It is first cooked as a thick curry and then cooked along with rice. Then given dum (the Indian method of steaming in a covered pot). Kalyani biryani is supposed to have originated in Bidar during the reign of the Kalyani Nawabs, who migrated to Hyderabad after one of the Nawabs, Ghazanfur Jang married into the Asaf Jahi family uniting their realms. Kalyani biryani was served by the Kalyani Nawabs to all of their subjects who came from Bidar to Hyderabad and stayed or visited their devdi or noble mansion. Calcutta or Kolkata biryani evolved from the Lucknow style when Awadh's last Nawab, Wajid Ali Shah, was exiled in 1856 to the Kolkata suburb of Metiabruz. Shah brought his personal chef with him. The Kolkata biriyani is characterized by the presence of potato in it.[16] A specialty of the Beary Muslim community in coastal Karnataka and is also known as Manglorean-style biryani. The dish is made using lots of green chilly and coconut and has the subtle flavor and aroma of fennel. Spices that include nutmeg, mint leaves, fennel seeds, mace (javitri), poppy seeds, almonds, star anise and others. The rice and meat (mutton, chicken, beef) are cooked separately and then layered and slowly cooked together again. This dish is highly served during marriages and other homely occasions. This type of biryani is popular in the Palakkad and Coimbatore regions. This was most commonly prepared by Rawther families in Kerala and Tamil Nadu. This type of biryani is cooked in a different style. Goat meat is most commonly used and it is entirely different from Malabar biryani.[citation needed] The exotic and aromatic Sindhi biryani is known in Pakistan for its spicy taste, fragrant rice, and delicate meat. Sindhi biryani is a beloved staple in food menus of Pakistani and Sindhi cuisine. Sindhi biryani is prepared with meat and a mixture of basmati rice, vegetables, and various spices. Biryani was brought into Sri Lanka by the South Indian Muslims who were trading in the Northern part of Sri Lanka and in Colombo in the early 1900s.[citation needed] In Sri Lanka, it is Buryani, a colloquial word which generated from Buhari Biryani. In many cases, Sri Lankan biryani is much spicier than most Indian varieties. Side dishes may include acchar, Malay pickle, cashew curry and mint sambol.[citation needed] Thalassery biryani is the variation of biryani found in the Indian state of Kerala. It is one of the many dishes of the Kerala Muslim community, and very popular.[54] The ingredients are chicken, spices and the specialty is the choice of rice called khyma. Khyma rice is generally mixed with ghee. Although a large number of spices such as mace, cashew nuts, sultana raisins, fennel-cumin seeds, tomato, onion, ginger, garlic, shallot, cloves and cinnamon are used,[55] there is only a small amount of chili (or chili powder) used in its preparation. A pakki biryani, the Thalassery biryani uses a small-grained thin (not round) fragrant variety of rice known as khyma or jeerakasala. The dum method of preparation (sealing the lid with dough [maida] or cloth and placing red-hot charcoal above the lid) is applied here to avoid scorched rice. In Myanmar (Burma), biryani is known in Burmese as danpauk or danbauk (\u1012\u1036\u1015\u1031\u102b\u1000\u103a), derived from the Persian term dum pukht, which refers to a slow oven cooking technique. Danbauk is a mainstay at festive events such as Thingyan, weddings and donation feasts.[56][57] Given danbauk's South Asian origins, danbauk restaurants and chains have traditionally been owned by Muslims, but in recent decades Buddhist entrepreneurs have entered the market.[56] Featured ingredients include: cashew nuts, yogurt, raisins and peas, chicken, cloves, cinnamon, saffron and bay leaf cooked in long-grain rice.[58] In danbauk, chicken specially seasoned with a danbauk masala spice mix,[59] is cooked with the rice.[60] Danbauk is typically eaten with a number of side dishes, including a fresh salad of sliced onions, julienned cabbage, sliced cucumbers, fermented limes and lemons, fried dried chilies, and soup.[61] In recent decades, danbauk restaurants have innovated variations, including \"ambrosia\" biryani (\u1014\u1010\u103a\u101e\u102f\u1013\u102c\u1011\u1019\u1004\u103a\u1038), which features dried fruits and buttered rice.[61] In Iraq and in the states of the Persian Gulf, biryani (\u0628\u0631\u064a\u0627\u0646\u064a: \"biryani\") is usually saffron-based with chicken usually being the meat or poultry of choice. It is popular throughout Iraq, especially in the Kurdistan Region.  Most variations also include vermicelli, fried onions, fried potato cubes, almonds, and raisins spread liberally over the rice.[16] Sometimes, a sour/spicy tomato sauce is served on the side (maraq). In Iran, during the Safavid dynasty (1501\u20131736), a dish called Beriyan Polo (Nastaliq script: \u0628\u0631\u06cc\u0627\u0646 \u067e\u0644\u0648) was made with lamb or chicken, marinated overnight\u2014with yogurt, herbs, spices, dried fruits like raisins, prunes or pomegranate seeds\u2014and later cooked in a tannour oven, then served with steamed rice.[citation needed] A different dish called biryan is popular in Afghanistan. Biryan traces its origins to the same source as biryani, and is today sold in Afghanistan as well as in Bhopal, India. Biryan is prepared by cooking gosht and rice together, but without the additional gravy (yakhni) and other condiments that are used in biryani. The Delhi-based historian Sohail Hashmi refers to the biryan as midway between pulao and biryani.  Afghan biryani tends to use much dry fruit such as raisins and lesser amounts of meat, often cut into tiny pieces.[22] Nasi kebuli is an Indonesian spicy steamed rice dish[62] cooked in goat meat broth, milk and ghee.[63] Nasi kebuli is descended from kabuli palaw which is an Afghani rice dish, similar to biryani served in the Indian subcontinent.[64] Although Indonesia has authentic nasi kebuli, Indonesia also inherited and has local-style of biryani which is known as nasi biryani or nasi briyani. Nasi biryani is popular among and often associated as Acehnese, Arab Indonesian, Indian Indonesian and Malay cuisine.[65] The Malaysian and Singaporean variety of biryani is called nasi briyani or nasi biryani. Although authentic styles of biryani from South India are popular, nasi briyani remains the most popular. The key differences between nasi briyani and Indian biryanis are that the meat in nasi briyani is cooked separately from the rice, and there is more curry, sauce, or gravy present in the nasi briyani than in Indian biryanis.[66] Nasi briyani dishes are very popular in Malaysia and Singapore. As an important part of Malaysian and Singaporean Indian cuisines, they are popularized through mamak stalls, hawker centres, and food courts as well as fine dining restaurants. There are also eateries that sell pork as the main meat of the dish in Singapore.[67][68] Biryani dishes are very popular in Mauritius, especially at Muslim weddings and festivities. It is also widely available at street food places. Mauritian biryanis are often accompanied by an achaar (mango pickles), chilies and salads. Kapampangan cuisine of the Philippines (often in Pampanga) features a special dish called nasing biringyi (chicken saffron rice), that is typically prepared only during special occasions such as weddings, family get-togethers or fiestas. It is not a staple of the Filipino diet as it is difficult to prepare compared to other usual dishes. Nasing biringyi is similar to the nasi briyani dish of Malaysia in style and taste. A version that has merged with the Filipino version of the Spanish paella is known as bringhe.[69] In the Cape Malay culture, a variation of biryani incorporates lentils as a key ingredient in the dish along with meat (usually beef, chicken, seafood or vegetables). The dish is made by cooking the rice and legumes and meat and gravy separately, then mixing it. Uncommonly, it is made using the dum-cooking method. The spices are similar to those used in the original Indian biryani. Variants of biryani exist in the cuisines of Somalia, Kenya, and Tanzania due to centuries of trade between the East African coast and South Asia for centuries, and the more recent migration of Indians to the latter two countries more recently during the British colonial era. Zanzibar has its own form of biryani characterized by the mixture of East African and Indian spices, as well as influences from Arab cuisine. The meat used is most commonly chicken.[70] This variant is similar to the forms of biryani served in Kenya. In Somalia, the descendant of biryani is bariis iskukaris. It is served with chicken, goat, beef, lamb, or camel meat, and spiced with the Somali spice mixture xawaash and other spices. A unique characteristic of bariis and other Somali dishes is the addition of banana on the side to be mixed with the dish. Biryani in Thailand is commonly known as khao mhok (Thai: \u0e02\u0e49\u0e32\u0e27\u0e2b\u0e21\u0e01). It is commonly paired with chicken, beef or even fish and topped with fried garlic. The dish is common in Thai cuisine and is often served with a green sour sauce. Tehari and tehri are various names for the vegetarian adaptation of Biryani but are mainly classified as pulao. It was developed for the Hindu bookkeepers of the Muslim Nawabs. It is prepared by adding potatoes to the rice, as opposed to the case of biryani, where the rice is added to the meat. In Kashmir, tehari is sold as street food. Tehari became more popular during World War II, when meat prices increased substantially and potatoes became the popular substitute in biryani. Hot", "Biriyani": " Biryani (/b\u025c\u02d0r\u02c8j\u0251\u02d0ni/) is a mixed rice dish, mainly popular in South Asia. It is made with rice, some type of meat (chicken, goat, lamb, beef, prawn, or fish) and spices. To cater to vegetarians, in some cases, it is prepared by substituting vegetables or paneer for the meat.[1] Sometimes eggs and/or potatoes are also added.[2] Biryani is one of the most popular dishes in South Asia and among the South Asian diaspora, although the dish is often associated with the region's Muslim population in particular.[3] Similar dishes are also prepared in other parts of the world such as in Iraq, Myanmar, Thailand, and Malaysia.[4] Biryani is the single most-ordered dish on Indian online food ordering and delivery services, and has been labelled as the most popular dish overall in India.[3][5] One theory states that it originated from birinj (Persian: \u0628\u0631\u0646\u062c), the Persian word for rice.[6][7] Another theory states that it is derived from biryan or beriyan (Persian: \u0628\u0631\u06cc\u0627\u0646), which means \"to fry\" or \"to roast\".[8][9] It may alternatively be related to the Persian word bereshtan (Persian: \u0628\u0631\u0634\u062a\u0646) which also means \"to roast (onions)\", as the dish is often prepared by flavouring rice with fried onions and meat, besides mild spices. The exact origin of the dish is uncertain, however, it is speculated to have originated in Iran. In North India, different varieties of biryani developed.[6][10] According to historian Lizzie Collingham, the modern biryani developed in the royal kitchens of the Mughal Empire (1526\u20131857) and is a mix of the native spicy rice dishes of India and the Persian polao.[11] Indian restaurateur Kris Dhillon believes that the dish originated in Persia and was brought to India by the Mughals.[12] Salma Hossein, whom the BBC regards as the \"doyenne of Islamic cooking in India\", shares a similar view, asserting that biryani came to India from Persia even before the Mughal era. Food scholar Pushpesh Pant also challenges the Mughal-origin claim, stating that it originated in Iran and that \"there is no evidence that biryani first came to this land with the Mughals. It is far more probable that it travelled with pilgrims and soldier-statesmen of noble descent to the Deccan region in South India\".[13] Another theory claims that the dish was prepared in India before the first Mughal emperor Babur conquered India.[14] The 16th-century Mughal text Ain-i-Akbari makes no distinction between biryanis and pilaf (or pulao): it states that the word \"biryani\" is of older usage in India.[citation needed][15] A similar theory, that biryani came to India with Timur's invasion, appears to be incorrect because there is no record of biryani having existed in his native land during that period.[14] According to Pratibha Karan, who wrote the book Biryani, biryani is of Mughal origin, derived from pilaf varieties brought to the Indian subcontinent by Arab traders. She speculates that the pulao was an army dish in medieval India. Armies would prepare a one-pot dish of rice with whichever meat was available. Over time, the dish became biryani due to different methods of cooking, with the distinction between \"pulao\" and \"biryani\" being arbitrary.[6][14] According to Vishwanath Shenoy, the owner of a biryani restaurant chain in India, one branch of biryani comes from the Mughals, while another was brought by the Arab traders to Malabar in South India.[16] There are various apocryphal stories dating the invention to Shah Jahan's time but Rana Safvi, the distinguished historian, says she could only find a recipe from the later Mughal period, from Bahadur Shah Zafar's time. It is not her claim that there was no biryani before that; just that she has not found a recipe. Other historians who have gone through texts say that the first references to biryani only appear around the 18th century.[17] Some claim that the dish \"oonchoru\" as mentioned in Sangam literature, which dates from between 200 BCE and 200 CE, is a predecessor of modern biryani. This dish, which was served to the soldiers of the Chera kings in Kerala, was said to be made of rice, ghee, meat, turmeric, coriander, pepper, and bay leaf.[18][19][20] The spices used in the preparation of South Indian biryanis, such as those used in the Malabar variety, are distinctive to the region and the Western Ghats. These spices are not found in the Middle East, Persia, or North India, underscoring the unique culinary heritage and local ingredients of South Indian biryani.[18][19][20] In South India, where rice is more widely used as a staple food, several distinct varieties of biryani emerged from Hyderabad in Telangana, Vijayawada in Andhra Pradesh, Mangalore and Bhatkal in Coastal Karnataka, Thalassery and Kozhikode in Malabar Kerala, as well as Ambur and Chettinad in Tamil Nadu.[6][10] Pilaf or pulao, as it is known on the Indian subcontinent, is another mixed rice dish popular in the cuisines of the Indian subcontinent, Central Asia, and Middle Eastern cuisine. Opinions differ on the differences between pulao and biryani, and whether actually there is a difference between the two.[21] According to Delhi-based historian Sohail Hashmi, pulao tends to be plainer than biryani, and consists of meat or vegetables cooked with rice with the bottom layered with potatoes or onions. Biryani contains more gravy (or yakhni), and is often cooked longer, leaving the meat (and vegetables, if present) more tender, and the rice more flavoured. Biryani is also cooked with additional dressings and often would have a light layer of scorched rice at the bottom.[22] Author Pratibha Karan states that while the terms are often applied arbitrarily, the main distinction is that a biryani consists of two layers of rice with a layer of meat (and vegetables, if present) in the middle, while the pulao is not layered.[14] Author Colleen Taylor Sen lists the following distinctions between biryani and pulao:[23] Ingredients for biryani vary according to the region and the type of meat and vegetables used. Meat (chicken, goat, beef, lamb,[26] prawn or fish) is the prime ingredient with rice. As is common in dishes of the Indian subcontinent, vegetables are sometimes also used when preparing biryani. Corn may be used, depending on the season and availability. Navratan biryani tends to use sweeter, richer ingredients such as cashews, sultanas (kismis), and fruits such as apples and pineapples.[22] The spices and condiments used in biryani may include fennel seeds, ghee (clarified butter), nutmeg, mace,[27] pepper, cloves,[27] cardamom, cinnamon, bay leaves, coriander, mint, ginger, onions, tomatoes, green chilies,[26] star anise, and garlic. The premium varieties include saffron.[27] Some commercial recipes for Biryani also include aromatic essences such as Mitha Ittar see attar, kewra and rose water. Dried sour prunes (Alu Bukhara) may also be added to the biryani. In nasi briyani and other variants made in Southeast Asian countries such as Malaysia, Singapore, and Indonesia, typical Southeast Asian spices and aromatics such as pandan leaf may be used alongside typical South Asian spices.[28] The main ingredient that usually accompanies the spices is chicken, lamb or goat meat; special varieties might use beef or seafood instead. The dish may be served with dahi chutney or raita, seekh kebab, korma, curry, a sour dish of aubergine (brinjal), boiled egg, and salad. Biryani can be cooked using one of two styles/techniques, pakki (\"cooked\") and kacchi (\"raw\").[29] There are many types of biryani, whose names are often based on their region of origin. For example, Sindhi biryani developed in the Sindh region of what is now Pakistan, and Hyderabadi biryani developed in the city of Hyderabad in South India. Some have taken the name of the shop that sells it, for example: Haji Biriyani, Haji Nanna Biriyani in Old Dhaka,[30] Fakhruddin Biriyani in Dhaka,[31][32] Students biryani in Karachi, Lucky biryani in Bandra, Mumbai and Baghdadi biryani in Colaba, Mumbai.[22] Biryanis are often specific to the Muslim communities where they originate; they are usually the defining dishes of those communities.[33] Ambur/Vaniyambadi biryani is a variety cooked in the neighboring towns of Ambur and Vaniyambadi in the Tirupattur district of the northeastern part of Tamil Nadu, which has a high Muslim population.

Side dishes may include acchar, Malay pickle, cashew curry and mint sambol.[citation needed] Thalassery biryani is the variation of biryani found in the Indian state of Kerala. It is one of the many dishes of the Kerala Muslim community, and very popular.[54] The ingredients are chicken, spices and the specialty is the choice of rice called khyma. Khyma rice is generally mixed with ghee. Although a large number of spices such as mace, cashew nuts, sultana raisins, fennel-cumin seeds, tomato, onion, ginger, garlic, shallot, cloves and cinnamon are used,[55] there is only a small amount of chili (or chili powder) used in its preparation. A pakki biryani, the Thalassery biryani uses a small-grained thin (not round) fragrant variety of rice known as khyma or jeerakasala. The dum method of preparation (sealing the lid with dough [maida] or cloth and placing red-hot charcoal above the lid) is applied here to avoid scorched rice. In Myanmar (Burma), biryani is known in Burmese as danpauk or danbauk (\u1012\u1036\u1015\u1031\u102b\u1000\u103a), derived from the Persian term dum pukht, which refers to a slow oven cooking technique. Danbauk is a mainstay at festive events such as Thingyan, weddings and donation feasts.[56][57] Given danbauk's South Asian origins, danbauk restaurants and chains have traditionally been owned by Muslims, but in recent decades Buddhist entrepreneurs have entered the market.[56] Featured ingredients include: cashew nuts, yogurt, raisins and peas, chicken, cloves, cinnamon, saffron and bay leaf cooked in long-grain rice.[58] In danbauk, chicken specially seasoned with a danbauk masala spice mix,[59] is cooked with the rice.[60] Danbauk is typically eaten with a number of side dishes, including a fresh salad of sliced onions, julienned cabbage, sliced cucumbers, fermented limes and lemons, fried dried chilies, and soup.[61] In recent decades, danbauk restaurants have innovated variations, including \"ambrosia\" biryani (\u1014\u1010\u103a\u101e\u102f\u1013\u102c\u1011\u1019\u1004\u103a\u1038), which features dried fruits and buttered rice.[61] In Iraq and in the states of the Persian Gulf, biryani (\u0628\u0631\u064a\u0627\u0646\u064a: \"biryani\") is usually saffron-based with chicken usually being the meat or poultry of choice. It is popular throughout Iraq, especially in the Kurdistan Region.  Most variations also include vermicelli, fried onions, fried potato cubes, almonds, and raisins spread liberally over the rice.[16] Sometimes, a sour/spicy tomato sauce is served on the side (maraq). In Iran, during the Safavid dynasty (1501\u20131736), a dish called Beriyan Polo (Nastaliq script: \u0628\u0631\u06cc\u0627\u0646 \u067e\u0644\u0648) was made with lamb or chicken, marinated overnight\u2014with yogurt, herbs, spices, dried fruits like raisins, prunes or pomegranate seeds\u2014and later cooked in a tannour oven, then served with steamed rice.[citation needed] A different dish called biryan is popular in Afghanistan. Biryan traces its origins to the same source as biryani, and is today sold in Afghanistan as well as in Bhopal, India. Biryan is prepared by cooking gosht and rice together, but without the additional gravy (yakhni) and other condiments that are used in biryani. The Delhi-based historian Sohail Hashmi refers to the biryan as midway between pulao and biryani.  Afghan biryani tends to use much dry fruit such as raisins and lesser amounts of meat, often cut into tiny pieces.[22] Nasi kebuli is an Indonesian spicy steamed rice dish[62] cooked in goat meat broth, milk and ghee.[63] Nasi kebuli is descended from kabuli palaw which is an Afghani rice dish, similar to biryani served in the Indian subcontinent.[64] Although Indonesia has authentic nasi kebuli, Indonesia also inherited and has local-style of biryani which is known as nasi biryani or nasi briyani. Nasi biryani is popular among and often associated as Acehnese, Arab Indonesian, Indian Indonesian and Malay cuisine.[65] The Malaysian and Singaporean variety of biryani is called nasi briyani or nasi biryani. Although authentic styles of biryani from South India are popular, nasi briyani remains the most popular. The key differences between nasi briyani and Indian biryanis are that the meat in nasi briyani is cooked separately from the rice, and there is more curry, sauce, or gravy present in the nasi briyani than in Indian biryanis.[66] Nasi briyani dishes are very popular in Malaysia and Singapore. As an important part of Malaysian and Singaporean Indian cuisines, they are popularized through mamak stalls, hawker centres, and food courts as well as fine dining restaurants. There are also eateries that sell pork as the main meat of the dish in Singapore.[67][68] Biryani dishes are very popular in Mauritius, especially at Muslim weddings and festivities. It is also widely available at street food places. Mauritian biryanis are often accompanied by an achaar (mango pickles), chilies and salads. Kapampangan cuisine of the Philippines (often in Pampanga) features a special dish called nasing biringyi (chicken saffron rice), that is typically prepared only during special occasions such as weddings, family get-togethers or fiestas. It is not a staple of the Filipino diet as it is difficult to prepare compared to other usual dishes. Nasing biringyi is similar to the nasi briyani dish of Malaysia in style and taste. A version that has merged with the Filipino version of the Spanish paella is known as bringhe.[69] In the Cape Malay culture, a variation of biryani incorporates lentils as a key ingredient in the dish along with meat (usually beef, chicken, seafood or vegetables). The dish is made by cooking the rice and legumes and meat and gravy separately, then mixing it. Uncommonly, it is made using the dum-cooking method. The spices are similar to those used in the original Indian biryani. Variants of biryani exist in the cuisines of Somalia, Kenya, and Tanzania due to centuries of trade between the East African coast and South Asia for centuries, and the more recent migration of Indians to the latter two countries more recently during the British colonial era. Zanzibar has its own form of biryani characterized by the mixture of East African and Indian spices, as well as influences from Arab cuisine. The meat used is most commonly chicken.[70] This variant is similar to the forms of biryani served in Kenya. In Somalia, the descendant of biryani is bariis iskukaris. It is served with chicken, goat, beef, lamb, or camel meat, and spiced with the Somali spice mixture xawaash and other spices. A unique characteristic of bariis and other Somali dishes is the addition of banana on the side to be mixed with the dish. Biryani in Thailand is commonly known as khao mhok (Thai: \u0e02\u0e49\u0e32\u0e27\u0e2b\u0e21\u0e01). It is commonly paired with chicken, beef or even fish and topped with fried garlic. The dish is common in Thai cuisine and is often served with a green sour sauce. Tehari and tehri are various names for the vegetarian adaptation of Biryani but are mainly classified as pulao. It was developed for the Hindu bookkeepers of the Muslim Nawabs. It is prepared by adding potatoes to the rice, as opposed to the case of biryani, where the rice is added to the meat. In Kashmir, tehari is sold as street food. Tehari became more popular during World War II, when meat prices increased substantially and potatoes became the popular substitute in biryani. Hot", "Kulfi": "  Kulfi (/k\u028alfi\u02d0/) is a frozen dairy dessert from the Indian subcontinent. It is often described as \"traditional Indian ice cream\".[3] Kulfi originated in 16th-century Delhi during the Mughal era. It is part of the national cuisines of India and Pakistan.[citation needed] It is also popular in Bangladesh, Myanmar, Nepal, Sri Lanka, and the Middle East.[4][better\u00a0source\u00a0needed] Kulfi is denser and creamier than regular ice cream.[3][4][5] It comes in various flavours. Traditional ones include cream (malai), rose, mango, cardamom (elaichi), saffron (kesar or zafran), and pistachio.[4][6][better\u00a0source\u00a0needed] Newer flavours may include apple, orange, strawberry, peanut, or avocado.[4][better\u00a0source\u00a0needed] Unlike ice cream, kulfi is not whipped, which results in a solid, dense dessert similar to frozen custard. Thus, it is sometimes considered a distinct category of frozen dairy-based dessert.[5] The density of kulfi causes it to melt more slowly than ice cream.[7] The word kulfi comes from the Persian qulfi (\u0642\u0644\u0641\u06cc) meaning \"covered cup\". The dessert originated in Delhi during the Mughal Empire in the 16th century.[1][2][8] The mixture of dense evaporated milk was already popular in the sweet dishes in the Indian subcontinent. During the Mughal period, this mixture was flavoured with pistachios and saffron, packed into metal cones and immersed in slurry ice, resulting in the invention of kulfi. Ain-i-Akbari, a detailed record of the Mughal emperor Akbar's administration, mentions use of saltpeter for refrigeration as well as transportation of Himalayan ice to warmer areas.[1][8] Although Delhi has been described as the birthplace of kulfi, Australian food historian Charmaine O'Brien suggests, \"...it is likely that [kulfi] originally evolved in the cooler climates of Persia or Samarkand and that the Mughals appropriated the concept and elaborated on it to create the creamy, perfumed dessert that it now is.\"[2] To prepare kulfi, sweetened, flavoured milk is slow cooked. The milk is stirred almost continuously to prevent it from sticking to the cooking utensil. During this process, the milk condenses and thickens.[9] The slow cooking caramelises the sugar in the mixture and browns its milk proteins, giving kulfi its distinctive taste.[6][10] The mixture is then poured into moulds (often kulhars) and sealed. The sealed moulds are submerged in an insulated matka filled with ice and salt. This quickly freezes the mixture, giving it a soft, smooth consistency free of ice crystals. Kulfi prepared in this traditional way is called matka kulfi.[11] The moulds are removed from the freezer 10\u201315 minutes before serving to allow the kulfi to melt slightly. The kulfi is then removed from the moulds and garnished with ground cardamom, saffron, or pistachios. Kulfi is also served with falooda (vermicelli noodles).[12] Throughout the Indian subcontinent, kulfi is sold by street vendors known as kulfiwallahs. It is also commonly served in Indian restaurants.[13]", "Ras Malai": " Ras malai, also known as rasamalei, or roshmalai, is a dessert that invented in Kolkata, British India at 1868 by Krishna Chandra Das.[1] The dessert is called roshmalai in Bengali,[2] ras malai in Hindi,[3] and rasa malei in Odia.[4] It is popular in India, Bangladesh and Pakistan.[5] The original term for ras malai is \"rosho malai (Bengali: \u09b0\u09b8\u09ae\u09be\u09b2\u09be\u0987) which derived from the Classical Bengali word \"rosho malai\" with the same meaning. The term is made with a Bengali word Rosh (Bengali: \u09b0\u09b8) which means sap and a Hindustani word Malai (Hindi: \u092e\u0932\u093e\u0908, Urdu: \u0645\u0644\u0627\u0626\u06cc) which means clotted cream hence the name of the sweet sap of clotted cream.[3] Das Grandsons say that their forefather Krishna Chandra Das invented the ras malai in the early 20th century. His father, Nobin Chandra had come to Calcutta and opened a sweet shop in 1866. He wanted to create an entirely new dish, so he did a lot of experimentation and ended up inventing the rasmalai in 1868. Ras malai consists of flattened balls of chhena soaked in malai (a type of clotted cream) flavoured with cardamom. Milk is boiled and a bit of vinegar or lime juice is added to split it. The whey is discarded and the milk solids are drained, cooled and kneaded into a dough. The dough is divided into small balls and the balls are cooked in hot water with a bit of rose water added. The balls are then cooked in milk with saffron, pistachios and kheer as stuffing.[6] Different types of ras malai also can be found in different areas such Rasmanjuri of Rangpur division. In Dhaka and Rangpur, the ras malais are similar in shape to the rasgullas,[7] and round discs. This Indian cuisine\u2013related article is a stub. You can help Wikipedia by expanding it.

Cold", "Samosas": " A samosa (/s\u0259\u02c8mo\u028as\u0259/) (listen\u24d8) from the Persian word Sambosag (\u0633\u0646\u0628\u0648\u0633\u06af) \u00a0(Meaning triangular pastry) is a fried South Asian[2] and Iranian (Persian) Dish, It is a pastry with a savoury filling, mostly vegetables, spiced potatoes, onions, peas, also non-vegetarian meat, or fish. It is made into different shapes, including triangular, cone, or crescent,  depending on the region.[3][4][5] Samosas are often accompanied by chutney, and have origins in medieval times or earlier.[3] Sweet versions are also made. Samosas are a popular entr\u00e9e, appetizer, or snack in the cuisines of South Asia, the Middle East, Central Asia, East Africa and their South Asian diasporas. The English word samosa derives from the Hindustani word samosa (Urdu: \u0633\u0645\u0648\u0633\u06c1, Hindi: \u0938\u092e\u094b\u0938\u093e),[6] traceable to the Middle Persian word sanbosag (\u0633\u0646\u0628\u0648\u0633\u06af)[7] 'triangular pastry'.[8] Similar pastries are called sambusak in Arabic; medieval Arabic recipe books sometimes spell it sambusaj.[9] The South Asian samosa is believed to be derived from a medieval precursor from the Middle East[10][11] that was baked and not fried. The earliest mention of a samosa precursor was by Abbasid-era poet Ishaq al-Mawsili, praising the sanbusaj. Recipes are found in 10th\u201313th-century Arab cookery books, under the names sanbusak, sanbusaq, and sanbusaj, all deriving from the Persian word sanbosag. In Iran, the dish was popular until the 16th century, but by the 20th century its popularity was restricted to certain provinces (such as the sambusas of Larestan).[3] Abolfazl Beyhaqi (995\u20131077), an Iranian historian, mentioned it in his history, Tarikh-e Beyhaghi.[12] The Central Asian samsa was introduced to the Indian subcontinent in the 13th or 14th century by chefs from the Middle East and Central Asia who cooked in the royal kitchens for the rulers of the Delhi Sultanate.[13] Amir Khusro (1253\u20131325), a scholar and the royal poet of the Delhi Sultanate, wrote around 1300\u00a0CE that the princes and nobles enjoyed the \"samosa prepared from meat, ghee, onion, and so on\".[14] Ibn Battuta, a 14th-century traveler and explorer, describes a meal at the court of Muhammad bin Tughluq, where the samushak or sambusak, a small pie stuffed with minced meat, almonds, pistachios, walnuts and spices, was served before the third course of pulao.[15] Nimatnama-i-Nasiruddin-Shahi, a medieval Indian cookbook started for Ghiyath Shah, the ruler of the Malwa Sultanate in central India, mentions the art of making samosa.[16] The Ain-i-Akbari, a 16th-century Mughal document, mentions the recipe for qottab, which it says, \"the people of Hindustan call sanb\u00fasah\".[17] The samosa is prepared with an all-purpose flour (locally known as maida) and stuffed with a filling, often a mixture of diced and cooked or mashed boiled potato, onions, green peas, lentils, ginger, spices and green chili.[18][19] A samosa can be vegetarian or non-vegetarian, depending on the filling. The entire pastry is deep-fried in vegetable oil or (rarely) ghee to a golden brown. It is served hot, often with fresh green chutney, such as mint or coriander chutney, or tamarind chutney. It can also be prepared in a sweet form. Samosas are often served in chaat (a type of street food), along with the traditional accompaniments of either a chickpea or a white pea preparation, drizzled with yogurt, tamarind chutney and green chutney, and garnished with chopped onions, coriander, and chaat masala. In the Indian states of Assam, Odisha, West Bengal, Bihar and Jharkhand, singaras or singras (\u099a\u09bf\u0982\u09f0\u09be)[20] (the East Indian version of samosas) are popular snacks found almost everywhere. They are a bit smaller than in other parts of India, with a filling consisting chiefly of cooked diced potato, peanuts, and sometimes raisins.[18] Shingras are wrapped in a thin sheet of dough (made of all-purpose flour) and fried. Good shingras are distinguished by flaky textures akin to that of a savory pie crust. Singaras may be eaten as a tea-time snack. They can also be prepared in a sweet form. Bengali singaras tend to be triangular, filled with potato, peas, onions, diced almonds, or other vegetables, and are more heavily fried and crunchier than other singaras or their samosa cousins. Singara filled with cauliflower mixture is a popular variation. Non-vegetarian varieties of singaras are mutton singaras and fish singaras. There are also sweet versions, such as coconut singara, as well as others filled with khoya and dipped in sugar syrup that are known as Mishti Shingara. In the city of Hyderabad, a smaller version of samosa with a thicker pastry crust and minced meat filling, referred to as lukhmi,[18] is consumed, as is another variation with an onion filling. In the states of Andhra Pradesh, Karnataka, Kerala, and Tamil Nadu, samosas are slightly different, being folded differently, more like Portuguese chamu\u00e7as, with a different style of pastry. The filling also differs, typically featuring mashed potatoes with spices, fried onions, peas, carrots, cabbage, curry leaves, and green chilis, and is mostly eaten without chutney. Samosas in South India are made in different sizes, whose fillings are influenced by local food habits, and may include meat. Both flat-shaped (triangular) and full-shaped (tetrahedron/triangular pyramid) samosas are popular snacks in Bangladesh. A Bengali version of the full-shaped samosa is called a \u09b8\u09bf\u0999\u09be\u09a1\u09bc\u09be (shingara) and is normally smaller than the standard variety. The shingara is usually filled with pieced potatoes, vegetables, nuts, etc. However, shingaras filled with beef liver are very popular in some parts of the country. The flat-shaped samosa is called a somosa or somucha, and is usually filled with onions and minced meat. Samosas are called singadas in the eastern zone of Nepal; the rest of the country calls it samosa. As in India, it is a very popular snack in Nepalese cuisine. Vendors sell the dish in various markets and restaurants. Samosas of various types are available throughout Pakistan. In general, most samosa varieties sold in the southern Sindh province and in the eastern Punjab, especially the city of Lahore, are spicier and mostly contain vegetable or potato-based fillings. However, the samosas sold in the west and north of the country mostly contain minced meat-based fillings and are comparatively less spicy. The meat samosa contains minced meat (lamb, beef, or chicken) and is very popular as a snack food in Pakistan. In Pakistan, the samosas of Karachi are famous for their spicy flavour, whereas samosas from Faisalabad are noted for being unusually large. Another distinct variety of samosa, available in Karachi, is called kaghazi samosa (Urdu: \u06a9\u0627\u063a\u0630\u06cc \u0633\u0645\u0648\u0633\u06c1; \"paper samosa\" in English) due to its thin and crispy covering, which resembles a wonton or spring roll wrapper. Another variant, popular in Punjab, consists of samosas with side dishes of mashed spiced chickpeas, onions, and coriander leaf salad, as well as various chutneys to top the samosas. Sweet samosas are also sold in the cities of Pakistan including Peshawar; these sweet samosas contain no filling and are dipped in thick sugar syrup. Another Pakistani snack food, which is popular in Punjab, is known as \"samosa chaat\". This is a combination of a crumbled samosa, along with spiced chickpeas (channa chaat), yogurt, and chutneys. Alternatively, the samosa can be eaten on its own with a side of chutney. In Pakistan, samosas are a staple Iftar food for many Pakistani families, during the month of Ramzan. The types and varieties of samosa made in Maldivian cuisine are known as bajiyaa. They are filled with a mixture including fish like tuna and onions.[21] Similar snacks and variants of samosas are found in many other countries. They are derived either from the South Asian somasa or are derived from the medieval precursor that originated in the Middle East. Samosas are called samuza (\u1005\u1019\u1030\u1006\u102c) in Burmese, and are an extremely popular street snack in Burma. Samosas are also used in a traditional Burmese salad, called samuza thoke (\u1005\u1019\u1030\u1006\u102c\u101e\u102f\u1015\u103a\u200c; lit.\u2009'samosa salad'), a salad of cut samosa pieces with onions, cabbage, fresh mint, light potato and chickpea curry broth, masala, chili powder, salt and lime.[22] In Indonesia, samosas are locally known as samosa, filled with potato, cheese, curry, rousong or noodles as adapted to local taste. They are usually served as a snack with sambal. Samosa is almost similar to Indonesian pastel, panada and epok-epok. Samosas are also a key part of East African food often seen in Somalia, Tanzania, Kenya, Uganda, Burundi, Eritrea, Ethiopia, and Rwanda. The variety of samosa made in Somali cuisine is known as \"sambusa\" or \"sambuus\" and is filled with ground beef or vegetables along with usually being blended with Somali spices.  Sambusa  is often consumed during Ramadan. Samosas are also a staple of local cuisine in the fellow Horn of Africa countries of Djibouti and Ethiopia, where they are known as sambuuse. Called samoosas in South Africa,[23][24] they tend to be smaller than Indian variants,[25] and form part of South African Indian and Cape Malay cuisine. Samosas also exist in West African countries such as Ghana and Nigeria where they are a common street food. In Nigeria, it is usually served in parties along with chicken or beef, puff puff, spring rolls and plantains and are called small chops. Samosas, locally called samoussas, are a popular snack on R\u00e9union and Mauritius as both islands have faced large waves of labor immigration from the Indian subcontinent. The samosas there are generally smaller and filled with chicken, cheese, crabs or potatoes. There are also varieties such as chocolate and banana or pizza.\n[26] Sambusak (Hebrew: \u05e1\u05de\u05d1\u05d5\u05e1\u05e7) comes in several distinct forms, as sambusak has been influenced differently by Sephardic and Mizrahi cuisine. Sephardi sambusak is generally thicker, baked, and stuffed with either cheese or beef and coated with sesame or nigella seeds. Mizrahi sambusak is generally thinner, larger, fried, and stuffed with curry-spiced chickpea and onion, and is usually not coated with seeds.[27][28][29][30][31] Sambousek (Arabic: \u0633\u0645\u0628\u0648\u0633\u0643) are usually filled with either meat, onion, pine nuts, za\u2019atar, spinach dock, or cheese.\nThey are widely consumed in the holy month of Ramadan. Sambuseh (Persian: \u0633\u0645\u0628\u0648\u0633\u0647) can often be found in the southern regions of Iran and rarely in other areas. However, traditionally it used to be made in the form of qottab filled with ground nuts (usually, walnuts), sugar, fragrant herbs or spices, and likewise fried in oil. It is used as a confectionary and quite commonly.  When meat is used, it is no longer called qottab. This is all that remains of the old \"sanbusag\" in its ancient homeland. Nowadays, Iranian Sambuseh is often made with a sausage and pizza cheese based filling; however, a vegetable-based variety also exists. In Goa (India), Portugal, and Angola, samosas are known as chamu\u00e7as. They are usually filled with chicken, beef, pork, lamb or vegetables, and generally served quite hot. Samosas are an integral part of Goan and Portuguese cuisine, where they are a common snack. Samosas are popular in the United Kingdom, Australia, New Zealand, Trinidad and Tobago, Barbados, Guyana, Uganda, South Africa, Rwanda, Kenya and Tanzania, and are also growing in popularity in Canada,[32][33] and the United States. They may be called samboosa or sambusac, but in South Africa, they are often called samoosa.[34] Frozen samosas are increasingly available from grocery stores in Australia, Canada, the United States,[35] and the United Kingdom, where they are also frequently sold fresh by local Indian and Pakistani street market vendors. Variations using filo,[36] or flour tortillas[37] are sometimes found. Al-Shabaab, the extremist group controlling parts of Somalia, banned samosas in 2011 over concerns about the possible use of rotten meat in the filling.[38] Hot", "Bhel Puri": " Bhelpuri is a savoury snack originally from India, and is also a type of chaat. It is made of puffed rice, crumbled crunchy puri, onions, cilantro and tossed with two chutneys: a green spicy cilantro chutney[1] and a brown tangy tamarind chutney.[2][3] Bhel is often identified as a 'beach snack', strongly associated with the beaches of Mumbai, such as Chowpatty or Juhu.[4] One theory for its origin is that it was invented at a restaurant called Vithal near Victoria Terminus. According to another theory, bhelpuri was conceived by the city's Gujarati community, who made it by adding complex flavours to the simple North Indian chaat. Gujarati housewives began making it and invented several varieties like the pakodi puri, and as it grew in popularity, many communities made their own regional variations.[5] The  Mumbai recipe has spread to most parts of India, where it has been modified to suit local food availability. Dry bhel is made from bhadang, a spicy namkeen (snack) from Western Maharashtra, and is consumed after garnishing with onions, coriander and lemon juice.[6] The Bengali variant of bhelpuri is called jhalmuri (meaning \"spicy puffed rice\") and bhelpuri refers to panipuri instead in that ethnicity.[7] A local Karnataka variant of bhelpuri is known as churumuri or churmuri.[8] The recipe exists in many parts of India. Bhelpuri is made from puffed rice and sev (a fried snack shaped like thin noodles made from besan flour) mixed with potatoes, onions, chat masala and chutney and a mixture of other fried snacks as the base of the snack.[9]  Bhelpuri has a balance of sweet, salty, tart and spicy flavors, with different textures as well, including crispy and crunchy from the puffed rice and fried sev. Other commonly used ingredients include tomatoes and  chillis added to the base. In northern India, recipes also include boiled potatoes cut into small pieces.[10]", "Kedgeree": "Kedgeree (or occasionally kitcherie, kitchari, kidgeree, kedgaree, kitchiri, khichuri, or kaedjere) is a dish consisting of cooked, flaked fish (traditionally smoked haddock), boiled rice, parsley, hard-boiled eggs, curry powder, lemon juice, salt, butter or cream, and occasionally sultanas. The dish can be eaten hot or cold. Other fish can be used instead of haddock such as tuna or salmon,[1] though these are not traditional. In Scotland, kippers are often substituted for the smoked haddock.[2][3][4] In India, khichari is any of a large variety of legume-and-rice dishes. These dishes are made with a spice mixture designed for each recipe and either dry-toasted or fried in oil before inclusion. This dish was heavily adapted by the British, resulting in a dish almost unrecognisably different from the original khichari. Kedgeree is thought to have originated with the Indian rice-and-bean or rice-and-lentil dish khichu\u1e5b\u012b, traced back to 1340 or earlier.[5] Hobson-Jobson cites ibn Battuta (c.\u20091340) mentioning a dish of munj (mung beans) boiled with rice called kishr\u012b and cites a recipe for khichdi from the Ain-i-Akbari (c.\u20091590). In Gujarat, where khichdi remains popular, the lentil and rice dish is usually served with kadhi, a spiced yogurt dish that can be mixed with the khichdi. Khichdi is usually not prepared with fish in Gujarat, although fish is sometimes eaten with khichdi in coastal villages where seafood is plentiful. According to Hobson-Jobson, while fish is eaten with kedgeree, the use of the term for \"mess of re-cooked fish ... is inaccurate\".[6] The Mughal emperor Aurangzeb (d.1707) was fond of the Alamgiri Khichdi, a variety featuring fish and boiled eggs. It is widely believed that the dish was brought to the United Kingdom by returning British colonials who had enjoyed it in India and introduced it to the UK as a breakfast dish in Victorian times, part of the fashionable Anglo-Indian cuisine.[7] The dish was listed as early as 1790 in the recipe book of Stephana Malcolm of Burnfoot, Dumfriesshire.[8] The National Trust for Scotland's book The Scottish Kitchen by Christopher Trotter notes the Malcolm recipe and other old examples, expressing the belief that the dish was devised by Scottish regiments hankering for the tastes of India.[9] By the 19th century, Kedgeree had become a sophisticated breakfast/brunch dish in England, appearing, for example, in a Saki short story, \"A Bread and Butter Miss\".[10]", "Phaal": "Phall (Bengali: \u09ab\u09be\u09b2, lit.\u2009'jump'), also spelt fall, faal, phaal, fahl or fal, is a curry that originated in the Bangladeshi-owned curry-houses of Birmingham, England and has also spread to the United States.[1] It is not to be confused with the char-grilled, gravyless, finger food phall from Bangalore. It is one of the hottest forms of curry regularly available, even hotter than the vindaloo, using many ground standard chilli peppers, or a hotter type of chilli such as scotch bonnet, habanero, or Carolina Reaper. Typically, the dish is a tomato-based thick curry and includes ginger and optionally fennel seeds.[2] Phall has achieved notoriety as the spiciest generally available dish from Indian restaurants.[3] It is, however, quite rare to find in comparison to vindaloo (which is usually the staple hottest curry of most Indian restaurants in the UK).

Vegetables in the curry may commonly include potatoes, onions, carrots, chillies, peas, bell peppers and tomatoes. Street sellers usually cook the curry on a flat griddle (tava) and serve the dish hot.

Hot", "Aviyal": " Avial (Malayalam: \u0d05\u0d35\u0d3f\u0d2f\u0d32\u0d4d\u200d, pronounced [a\u028bijal]) is an Indian dish with origins in the state of Kerala of India. [1] It is a thick stew of usually 13 vegetables commonly found in the Western Ghats and coconut, seasoned with coconut oil and curry leaves. Avial is considered an essential part of the main meal in Kerala (Oonu in Malayalam) and is also served as a delicacy in South India.[2] Central Travancore has a slightly different variety of avial with its thin gravy whereas the classic avial is thick. Generally, only crisp vegetables are used in avial. Vegetables commonly used in avial are elephant foot yam, plantain, ash melon (wax gourd), carrots, beans, brinjal (aubergine), cucumber, drumstick pods, snake gourd and broad bean, etc. are the recent introduction, while the Avial from the Kozhikode region includes bitter gourd. Variants of avial from the Kollam region also includes tomato among other vegetables. Some people prefer to skip curd or replace it with raw mango or tamarind pulp. This dish can be made into a gravy or be made into a semi-solid side dish. It is generally eaten with rice. The word \"avial\" is also used to denote 'boiled' or 'cooked in water' \u2014 this sense being derived from the way the dish is made. Avial is believed to have been invented by the warrior Bhima during his exile. According to the legend, when Ballava\n(Bhima's name during this time) assumed his duties as the cook in the kitchen of Virata, he did not know how to cook. One of the first things he did was to chop up many different vegetables, boil them together and top the dish with grated coconut. [3][4]\nThere are mythological variations. Bhima is said to have prepared Avial, when there were unexpected guests for King Virata and he needed to serve meals for them. There were no sufficient vegetables to cook any single recipe for a side dish, so Bheema used whatever available vegetables to make a new dish, which came to be known as Avial. Another narrative version relates to the attempt made by Kauravas to kill Bhima. After poisoning Bhima, Kauravas tied Bhima and threw him into the water. Kauravas also communicated that they saw Bhima drowning in water. With the completion of the days of mourning, a funeral feast was planned and preparation were underway. Unexpectedly, Bhima emerged from the water, rescued by the Nagas. With this, preparations for the feast was cancelled. However, Bhima was unhappy with this decision, and decided to mix all of the vegetables to prepare a new dish which later became popular as Avial. Another popular old story is that in the Kingdom of Travancore in Kerala there was a great feast held by the king. Every one in the kingdom came to eat so there was a shortage of curry to be served. But in the kitchen also stocks were less so when the king visited the kitchen he found that a lot of vegetables were wasted when they were peeled. The king ordered the cook to make a curry with this along with some other ingredients so Avial was born. The king also ordered it to be served as the first item. Hence Avial is the first to be served on a Sadhya.[5][6][7]", "Paneer Tikka Masala": "Paneer tikka masala is an Indian dish of paneer tikka cheese served in a spiced gravy.

It is mainly eaten with traditional Indian flat-breads like tawa roti or tandoori roti, rice and bread. Chhena and Paneer are terms for Indian cottage cheese, and Rajwadi and shahi are terms for royal. Similar dishes include paneer butter masala and Kadai paneer. The subtle difference between paneer butter masala and shahi paneer is that more of whole spices are used in paneer butter masala, whereas shahi paneer has a sweeter taste when compared to paneer butter masala.[2]", "Gujarati Kadhi": "Gujarati kadhi (Gujarati: \u0a95\u0aa2\u0ac0) is a Gujarati version of kadhi.[1] It is a very popular Gujarati dish made from buttermilk or dahi (yogurt) and gram flour.[2] Kadhi is an essential part of Gujarati cuisine.[3] When Barack Obama visited India he was served Gujarati kadhi.[4] Kadhi was included on the Chinese president's menu when he visited Ahmedabad.[5] Kadhi has different varieties in India, due to which Gujarati kadhi is completely different from Sindhi Kadhi, Rajasthani Kadhi pakoda,[6] Badi Kadhi or a UP Kadhi except that all are yoghurt based (except Sindhi kadhi which has a tamarind base). In Gujarat, it's served with khichdi or steamed rice.[7] Gujarati Kadhi is lighter when compared to Rajasthani Kadhi.[8] The curd and gram flour are turned into a liquid mixture by mixing with a few cups of water.

Hot", "Cauliflower": "Cauliflower is one of several vegetables cultivated from the species Brassica oleracea in the genus Brassica, which is in the Brassicaceae (or mustard) family. An annual plant that reproduces by seed, the cauliflower head is composed of a (generally) white inflorescence meristem. Cauliflower heads resemble those in broccoli, which differs in having flower buds as the edible portion. Typically, only the head is eaten; the edible white flesh is sometimes called \"curd\".  The global production of cauliflower and broccoli in 2020 was over 25.5 million tons and worth 14.1 billion US dollars.[1] There are four major groups of cauliflower.[2] Cauliflowers are an \u2018arrested inflorescence\u2019\u00a0 subspecies of B. oleracea that arose around 2,500 years ago.[1] Genomic analysis finds initially evolved from broccoli with three MADS-box genes, playing roles in the formation of its curd. Nine loci and candidate genes are linked with morphological and biological characters.[1] There are hundreds of historic and current commercial varieties used around the world. A comprehensive list of about 80 North American varieties is maintained at North Carolina State University.[4] Cauliflower contains several non-nutrient phytochemicals common in the cabbage family that are under preliminary research for their potential properties, including isothiocyanates and glucosinolates.[8] Boiling reduces the levels of cauliflower glucosinolates, while other cooking methods, such as steaming, microwaving, and stir frying, have no significant effect on glucosinolate levels.[9] The word \"cauliflower\" derives from the Italian cavolfiore, meaning \"cabbage flower\".[10] The ultimate origin of the name is from the Latin words caulis (cabbage) and fl\u014ds (flower).[11] Cauliflower is the result of selective breeding and likely arose in the Mediterranean region, possibly from broccoli.[12] Pliny the Elder  included cyma among cultivated plants he described in Natural History: \"Ex omnibus brassicae generibus suavissima est cyma\"[13] (\"Of all the varieties of cabbage the most pleasant-tasted is cyma\").[14] Pliny's description likely refers to the flowering heads of an earlier cultivated variety of Brassica oleracea.[15] In the Middle Ages, early forms of cauliflower were associated with the island of Cyprus, with the 12th- and 13th-century Arab botanists Ibn al-'Awwam and Ibn al-Baitar claiming its origin to be Cyprus.[16][17] This association continued into Western Europe, where cauliflowers were sometimes known as Cyprus colewort, and there was extensive trade in western Europe in cauliflower seeds from Cyprus, under the French Lusignan rulers of the island, until well into the 16th century.[18] It is thought to have been introduced into Italy from Cyprus or the east coast of the Mediterranean around 1490, and then spread to other European countries in the following centuries.[12] Fran\u00e7ois Pierre La Varenne employed chouxfleurs in Le cuisinier fran\u00e7ois.[19] They were introduced to France from Genoa in the 16th century and are featured in Olivier de Serres' Th\u00e9\u00e2tre de l'agriculture (1600), as cauli-fiori \"as the Italians call it, which are still rather rare in France; they hold an honorable place in the garden because of their delicacy\", [20] but they did not commonly appear on grand tables until the time of Louis XIV.[21] It was introduced to India in 1822 by the British.[22] In 2020, global production of cauliflowers (combined for production reports with broccoli) was 25.5 million tonnes, led by China and India which, combined, had 72% of the world total.[23] Secondary producers, having 0.4\u20131.3 million tonnes annually, were the United States, Spain, Mexico, and Italy.[23]  Cauliflower is relatively difficult to grow compared to cabbage, with common problems such as an underdeveloped head and poor curd quality.[24] Because the weather is a limiting factor for producing cauliflower, the plant grows best in moderate daytime temperatures 21\u201329\u00a0\u00b0C (70\u201385\u00a0\u00b0F), with plentiful sun and moist soil conditions high in organic matter and sandy soils.[5] The earliest maturity possible for cauliflower is 7 to 12 weeks from transplanting.[24] In the northern hemisphere, fall season plantings in July may enable harvesting before autumn frost.[5] Long periods of sun exposure in hot summer weather may cause cauliflower heads to discolor with a red-purple hue.[5] Transplantable cauliflowers can be produced in containers such as flats, hotbeds, or fields. In soil that is loose, well-drained, and fertile, field seedlings are shallow-planted 1\u00a0cm (1\u20442\u00a0in) and thinned by ample space \u2013 about 12 plants per 30\u00a0cm (1\u00a0ft).[5] Ideal growing temperatures are about 18\u00a0\u00b0C (65\u00a0\u00b0F) when seedlings are 25 to 35 days old.[5] Applications of fertilizer to developing seedlings begin when leaves appear, usually with a starter solution weekly. Transplanting to the field normally begins in late spring and may continue until mid-summer. Row spacing is about 38\u201346\u00a0cm (15\u201318\u00a0in). \nRapid vegetative growth after transplanting may benefit from such procedures as avoiding spring frosts, using starter solutions high in phosphorus, irrigating weekly, and applying fertilizer.[5] The most important disorders affecting cauliflower quality are a hollow stem, stunted head growth or buttoning, ricing, browning, and leaf-tip burn.[5] Among major pests affecting cauliflower are aphids, root maggots, cutworms, moths, and flea beetles.[24] The plant is susceptible to black rot, black leg, club root, black leaf spot, and downy mildew.[5] When cauliflower is mature, heads appear clear white, compact, and 15\u201320\u00a0cm (6\u20138\u00a0in) in diameter, and should be cooled shortly after harvest.[5] Forced air cooling to remove heat from the field during hot weather may be needed for optimal preservation. Short-term storage is possible using cool, high-humidity storage conditions.[5] Many species of blowflies, including Calliphora vomitoria, are known pollinators of cauliflower.[25] Cauliflower heads can be roasted, grilled, boiled, fried, steamed, pickled, or eaten raw. When cooking, the outer leaves and thick stalks are typically removed, leaving only the florets (the edible \"curd\" or \"head\"). The leaves are also edible but are often discarded.[26] Cauliflower can be used as a low-calorie, gluten-free alternative to rice and flour. Between 2012 and 2016, cauliflower production in the United States increased by 63%, and cauliflower-based product sales increased by 71% between 2017 and 2018. Cauliflower rice is made by pulsing cauliflower florets and cooking the result in oil.[27][28] Cauliflower pizza crust is made from cauliflower flour and is popular in pizza restaurants.[29] Mashed cauliflower is a low-carbohydrate alternative to mashed potatoes.[30] Raw cauliflower is 92% water, 5% carbohydrates, 2% protein, and contains negligible fat (see table). A 100-gram (3+1\u20442-ounce) reference amount of raw cauliflower provides 104 kilojoules (25 kilocalories) of food energy, and has a high content (20% or more of the Daily Value, DV) of vitamin C (58% DV) and moderate levels of several B vitamins and vitamin K (13\u201315% DV; table). Contents of dietary minerals are low (7% DV or less). Cauliflower has been noticed by mathematicians for its distinct fractal dimension,[33][34] calculated to be roughly 2.8.[35][36]\nOne of the fractal properties of cauliflower is that every branch, or \"module\", is similar to the entire cauliflower. Another quality, also present in other plant species, is that the angle between \"modules\", as they become more distant from the center, is 360 degrees divided by the golden ratio.[37] The fancied resemblance of the shape of a boxer's ear to a cauliflower gave rise to the term \"cauliflower ear\". ", "Mango Lassi": " Lassi (pronounced [l\u0259s\u02d0i]) is a Punjabi yogurt\u2013based beverage with a smoothie-like consistency.[1][2] It has been called \"the most popular and traditional yogurt-based drink\" in India.[3] It has also been described as the form in which yogurt \"is most cherished and unbeatably popular in [...] Punjab\", its \"best-loved summer drink\", and \"the air conditioner of the Punjab\".[4] Lassi originated in the Punjab region of the Indian subcontinent.[3] The word lassi means yogurt mixed with water in Punjabi.[1] Lassi is prepared by blending yogurt, water, and spices. In Punjab, the yogurt is traditionally made from water buffalo milk.[4] However, variations of lassi can be prepared in different ways. Cumin and cardamom are the most common spices added to lassi.[5] Lassi is traditionally served in a clay cup known as kulhar.[5] Namkin or Namkeen (salty) lassi is made by adding salt, black pepper, cumin, and sugar to the yogurt-water mixture.[1][6] Lassi masalewal (spicy lassi) is made by adding ingredients such as almonds, ginger, green chilies, and pistachios to namkin lassi.[1] Meethi (sweet) lassi is made by adding cardamom, rosewater, and saffron to the yogurt-water mixture.[1][3] Bhang lassi is a cannabis-infused drink that contains bhang, a liquid derivative of cannabis, which has effects similar to other eaten forms of cannabis.[7] It is legal in many parts of India and mainly sold during Holi, when pakoras containing bhang are also sometimes eaten. Uttar Pradesh is known to have licensed bhang shops, and in many places, one can buy bhang products and drink bhang lassis.[8] Fruits such as mangos and strawberries may be added to the yogurt-water mixture to yield, for example, mango lassi and strawberry lassi.[1][3] In 2013, a group of IIT Kharagpur students lobbied Google to name its next Android version Lassi.[9] Chilled", "Mulligatawny Soup": " Mulligatawny (/\u02ccm\u028cl\u026a\u0261\u0259\u02c8t\u0254\u02d0ni/ \u24d8) is a soup which originated from South Indian cuisine. The name originates from the Tamil words mi\u1e37agu (\u0bae\u0bbf\u0bb3\u0b95\u0bc1 'black pepper'), and ta\u1e47\u1e47i (\u0ba4\u0ba3\u0bcd\u0ba3\u0bbf, 'water'); literally, \"pepper-water\".[1] It is related to the dish rasam.[citation needed] Main ingredients commonly include chicken, mutton, and lentils.[2] Mulligatawny was popular in India by the end of the 18th century,[1] and by the 19th century it began to appear in cookbooks of the day, with each cook (or cookbook) featuring its own recipe.[3] Recipes for mulligatawny varied greatly at that time and over the years (e.g., Maria Rundell's A New System of Domestic Cookery contained three versions), and later versions of the soup included British modifications that included meat,[4] although the local Madras (modern Chennai) recipe on which it was based did not.[5] Early references to it in English go back to 1784.[6] In 1827, William Kitchiner wrote that it had become fashionable in Britain: Mullaga-Tawny signifies pepper water. The progress of inexperienced peripatetic Palaticians[a] has lately been arrested by this outlandish word being pasted on the windows of our Coffee-Houses; it has, we believe, answered the \"Restaurateurs'\" purpose, and often excited John Bull, to walk in and taste\u2014the more familiar name of Curry Soup\u2014would, perhaps, not have had sufficient of the charms of novelty to seduce him from his much-loved Mock-Turtle.\nIt is a fashionable Soup and a great favourite with our East Indian friends, and we give the best receipt[b] we could procure for it.[7][8] By the mid-1800s, Arthur Robert Kenney-Herbert (1840\u20131916), under the pen name Wyvern, wrote in his popular Culinary Jottings that \"really well-made mulligatunny is ... a thing of the past.\"[5] He also noted that this simple recipe prepared by poorer natives of Madras as made by \"Mootoosamy\" was made by pounding: a dessert-spoonful of tamarind, six red chillies, six cloves of garlic, a tea-spoonful of mustard seed, a salt-spoonful of fenugreek seed, twelve black peppercorns, a tea-spoonful of salt, and six leaves of karay-pauk. When worked to a paste, he adds a pint of water, and boils the mixture for a quarter of an hour. While this is going on, he cuts up two small onions, puts them into a chatty, and fries them in dessert-spoonful of ghee till they begin to turn brown, when he strains the pepper-water into the chatty, and cooks the mixture for five minutes, after which it is ready. The pepper-water is, of course, eaten with a large quantity of boiled rice, and is a meal in itself. The English, taking their ideas from this simple composition, added other condiments, with chicken, mutton, &c., thickened the liquid with flour and butter, and by degrees succeeded in concocting a soupe grasse of a decidedly acceptable kind.[5][9] According to the Oxford Companion to Food, the simplest version of the soup included chicken or mutton, fried onion, and spices.[2] More complex versions may call for \"a score of ingredients\". Versions originating in southern India commonly called for lentils.[2] The dish is featured in the sketch Dinner for One which is \nbroadcast every New Year's Eve in Scandinavia and Germany.[10] In episode 6 from season 7 of the TV show Seinfeld, the character Elaine casually orders a mulligatawny soup from the infamous Soup Nazi's soup stand. However, after Elaine comments that the Soup Nazi looks like Al Pacino, he bans Elaine from the soup stand for one year and she does not get her soup. Alfred mentions that mulligatawny is Batman's favorite soup in Batman #701.[11] Hot, often with rice", "Raita": " Raita is a side dish in Indian cuisine made of dahi (yogurt, often referred to as curd) together with raw or cooked vegetables, fruit, or in the case of boondi raita, with fried droplets of batter made from besan (chickpea flour, generally labeled as gram flour). The closest approximation in Western cuisine is a side dish or dip, or a cooked salad. It is often referred to as a condiment, but unlike common Western condiments such as pepper, mustard, and horseradish that make dishes more spicy, a dish of dahi or raita has a cooling effect to contrast with spicy curries and kebabs that are the main fare of some Asian cuisines. In Indian cuisine, some type of flatbread may be eaten together with raita, chutneys, and pickles. The yogurt may be seasoned with coriander, roasted cumin seeds, mint, cayenne pepper, chaat masala and other herbs and spices. The word raita first appeared in print around the 19th century; it comes from the Hindi language.[1] The word raita in Bengali and Hindi is a portmanteau of the Sanskrit word rajika or the derivative Hindi rai (pronounced \"ra-ee\") meaning black mustard seed, and tiktaka, meaning sharp or pungent.[2] In South India, especially Kerala and Tamil Nadu, traditional raita is called pachadi,[3] Tayir pachadi. In Eastern Nepal, the dish is known as dahi kakro (lit.\u2009'yogurt cucumber'), whereas in western regions of Nepal it is known as raito.[4][5] Raita is also sometimes simply called dahi, or \"sourmilk\", after its main ingredient, particularly in South African Indian cuisine.[citation needed] Cumin (z\u012br\u0101) and black mustard (r\u0101\u012b\u00a0) are fried.  This tempering is then mixed with minced, raw vegetables or fruits (such as cucumber, onion, carrot, pineapple, papaya) and yogurt.[6] Raw ginger and garlic paste, green chili paste, and sometimes mustard paste are used to enrich flavour.[citation needed] A variety of raita of India varies from region to region, most notable raithas are boondi raitha\u2014tiny balls of fried gram flour (chickpea flour), which may taste salty or t\u012bkh\u0101 (spicy) and onion raita and vegetable raita. The mixture is served chilled. Raita may cool the palate when eating spicy Indian dishes.[7] Raitas can be prepared with three main base ingredients: vegetables, pulses and fruits. These are mixed with yogurt and flavoured with a variety of seasonings to make different types of raita.[8] Made either from sprouted pulses, roasted pulses or other condiments made from pulse flour. Raita is served as a side dish to be eaten with main course dishes.[8] Cold", "Garam Masala": "Garam masala (from Hindustani \u06af\u0631\u0645 \u0645\u0635\u0627\u0644\u062d\u06c1/\u0917\u0930\u092e \u092e\u0938\u093e\u0932\u093e garam mas\u0101l\u0101, \"hot spices\") is a blend of ground spices originating from South Asia. It is common in Indian, Pakistani, Nepalese, Bangladeshi, Sri Lankan and Caribbean cuisines. It is used alone or with other seasonings.\nThe specific fixings differ by district, but it regularly incorporates a blend of flavors like cardamom, cinnamon, cumin, cloves and peppercorns. Garam masala can be found in a wide range of dishes, including marinades, pickles, stews, and curries.[citation needed] The composition of garam masala differs regionally, with many recipes across the Indian subcontinent according to regional and personal taste,[1] and none is considered more authentic than another. The components of the mix are roasted, then ground together or added to the dish for flavour just before finishing cooking. A typical Indian version of garam masala[2] contains (with Hindi/Urdu names in parentheses): Some recipes[3] call for the spices to be blended with herbs, while others call for the spices to be ground with water, vinegar, or other liquids to make a paste. Some recipes include nuts, onions or garlic, or small quantities of star anise, asafoetida, chili, stone flower (known as dagadphool, lichen), and kababchini (cubeb). The flavours may be blended to achieve a balanced effect, or a single flavour may be emphasized. A masala may be toasted before use to release its flavours and aromas.[1] In the east of the Indian subcontinent, in West Bengal, Orissa, Assam and Bangladesh only cardamom, cinnamon and clove may be substituted for the assortment.[citation needed] The Burmese masala (\u1019\u1006\u101c\u102c) spice blend used in Burmese curries typically consists of ground cinnamon or cassia, cardamon, cloves, and black pepper.[4]", "Naan": " Naan (/n\u0251\u02d0n/) is a leavened, oven-baked (usually using a tandoor) or tawa-fried flatbread. It is characterized by its light and slightly fluffy texture and golden-brown spots from the baking process. [1] Naan is found in the cuisines mainly of Central Asia, South Asia, Southeast Asia, and the Caribbean.[2][3][4] Primarily composed of white or wheat flour combined with a leavening agent, typically yeast, naan dough develops air pockets that contribute to its fluffy and soft texture. Additional ingredients for crafting naan include warm water, salt, ghee (clarified butter), and yogurt, with optional additions like milk, egg, or honey. Sometimes, baking powder or baking soda is used instead of yeast to reduce the preparation time for the bread. In the traditional baking process inside a tandoor, naan dough is rolled into balls, flattened, and then pressed against the tandoor's inner walls, which can reach temperatures up to 480 \u00b0C (900 \u00b0F). This method allows the bread to be baked within minutes, achieving a spotty browning due to the intense heat. Alternatively, naan can be prepared on a stovetop using a flat pan known as a tawa. The pan may be flipped upside down over the flame to achieve the characteristic browning of the bread's surface. Once baked naan is typically coated with ghee or butter and served warm. This soft and pliable bread frequently accompanies meals, replacing utensils for scooping up dahls, sauces, stews, and curries, or is enjoyed with dryer dishes like tandoori chicken. [5] The term \"naan\" comes from Persian n\u00e2n (Persian: \u0646\u0627\u0646), a generic word for any kind of bread. This word was borrowed into a range of languages in the Indian subcontinent and Central Asia, where it came to refer to a specific type of bread. The term then spread around the globe along with the style of bread itself.[citation needed] The earliest known English use of the term occurs in an 1803 travelogue written by William Tooke.[6] While Tooke and other early sources spell it \"nan\", the spelling naan has become predominant since the late 1970s.[7][8] Naan spread to the Indian subcontinent during the Islamic Delhi Sultanate period. The earliest mention of naan in the region comes from the memoirs of Indo-Persian Sufi poet Amir Khusrau living in India during the 1300s AD. Amir Khusrau mentions two kinds of naan eaten by Muslim nobles; Naan-e-Tunuk and Naan-e-Tanuri. Naan-e-Tunuk was a light or thin bread, while Naan-e-Tanuri was a heavy bread and was baked in the tandoor.[9] During India\u2019s Mughal era in the 1520s, Naan was a delicacy that only nobles and royal families enjoyed because the art of making Naan was a revered skill, known by few and the lengthy process of making leavened bread. The Ain-i-Akbari, a written record of the third Mughal emperor\u2019s reign, also mentions naan and it was eaten with kebabs or kheema (spiced minced meat) in it. By the 1700s naan had reached the masses in Mughal cultural centers in South Asia.[10] In Indonesia, naan is popular in Indian Indonesian and Arab Indonesian communities as well as in Malay, Acehnese and Minangkabau communities\u2013with other variants of roti like roti canai. This dish is usually locally known as roti naan or roti nan and cooked using Indonesian spices, such as garlic with a local taste.[11] Naan bya (Burmese: \u1014\u1036\u1015\u103c\u102c\u1038) in Myanmar is traditionally served at teahouses with tea or coffee as a breakfast item.[12] It is round, soft, and blistered, often buttered, or with creamy p\u00e8 byouk (boiled chickpeas) cooked with onions spread on top, or dipped with Burmese curry.[12] The Jingzhou style of guokui, a flatbread prepared inside a cylindrical charcoal oven much like a tandoor, has been described as \"Chinese naan\".[13] It is also an integral part of Uyghur cuisine and is known in Chinese as \u9995 (n\u00e1ng).[14][15] After being promoted by Kandagawa Sekizai Shoukou in 1968, which is now the sole domestic manufacturer of tandoors, naan is now widely available in Indian-style curry restaurants in Japan, where naan is typically free-flow. Some restaurants bake ingredients such as cheese, garlic, onions, and potatoes into the naan, or cover it with toppings like a pizza.[16][17][18] In 1799, the word naan was introduced into the English language by historian and clergyman William Tooke. Today, naan can be found worldwide in restaurants serving South Asian and Middle Eastern cuisine, and it is available in many supermarkets. Fusion cuisine has introduced new dishes that incorporate naan, including naan pizza and naan tacos and even huevos rancheros (an egg dish) served over naan. Naan pizza is a type of pizza where naan is used as the crust instead of the traditional pizza dough. Chefs such as Nigella Lawson,[19] and supermarkets such as Wegmans[20] offer recipes for people to make their own naan pizza at home, though it is certainly not traditional.", "Paneer": " Paneer (pronounced [/p\u0259\u02c8ni\u02d0r/]), also known as ponir (pronounced [po\u032fni\u032fr]), is a fresh acid-set cheese common in the cuisine of the Indian subcontinent made from full-fat buffalo milk or cow milk.[1] It is a non-aged, non-melting soft cheese made by curdling milk with a fruit- or vegetable-derived acid, such as lemon juice. The word paneer entered English from the Hindi-Urdu term pan\u012br, which comes from Persian panir (\u067e\u0646\u06cc\u0631) 'cheese', which comes from Old Iranian.[2][3] Armenian panir (\u057a\u0561\u0576\u056b\u0580), Azerbaijani p\u0259ndir, Bengali ponir (\u09aa\u09a8\u09bf\u09b0), Turkish peynir and Turkmen pe\u00fdnir, all derived from Persian panir, also refer to cheese of any type.[4] The origin of paneer is debated. Ancient Indian, Afghan-Iranian and Portuguese origins have been proposed for paneer.[5][6] Acidulation of milk was taboo in the ancient Indo-Aryan culture, making an Indian origin unlikely; legends about Krishna make several references to milk, butter, ghee and dahi (yogurt), but do not mention sour milk cheese.[7] According to Arthur Berriedale Keith, a kind of cheese is \"perhaps referred to\" in Rigveda 6.48.18.[8] However, Otto Schrader (1890) believes that the Rigveda only mentions \"a skin of sour milk, not cheese in the proper sense\".[9] Vedic literature refers to a substance that is interpreted by some authors, such as K. T. Achaya, Om Prakash and Sanjeev Kapoor, as a possible form of paneer, but without definitive evidence.[5] Catherine Donnelly, author of The Oxford Companion to Cheese (2016), mentions that Vedic literature refers to cheese production made with the aid of barks of palash tree (Butea monosperma), fruits like jujube (Ziziphus mauritiana) and creeper like putika with coagulating enzymes, \"as well as Dadhanvat, a cheese-like substance made with and without pores\". According to Catherine Donnelly, these plant substances may have contained rennet-like enzymes and notes that the \"Vedas may include some of the earliest known references to rennet-coagulated cheeses\".[10] Lokopakara text dated to the 10th century gives two recipes for coagulated cheeses made from buffalo milk for making sweets using plants and roots. According to the text, buffalo milk was coagulated using roots of amaranth plant or leaves of marsh barbel (Hygrophila auriculata); the soft cheese produced in this manner was called Haluvuga. In the second recipe, buffalo milk was coagulated with Indian mallow (Abutilon indicum) or country mallow (Sida cordifolia) and was made into balls for sweets.[11] Manasollasa, a Sanskrit-language text by the 12th-century king Someshvara III, describes Kshiraprakara, a similar sweet food prepared from milk solids after separating boiled milk using a sour substance.[12] Another theory is that like the word itself, paneer originated in Persianate lands and spread to the Indian subcontinent under Muslim rule.[13] Paneer, according to this theory, was developed and moulded to suit local tastes under these rulers, and the Delhi Sultanate and Mughal Empire are when paneer as currently known developed. Another theory states that paneer is Afghan in origin and spread to India from the lands that make up Afghanistan.[13] National Dairy Research Institute states that paneer was introduced into India by Afghan and Iranian invaders.[14] Based on texts such as Charaka Samhita, BN Mathur wrote that the earliest evidence of a heat-acid coagulated milk product in India can be traced to 75\u2013300 CE, in the Kushan-Satavahana era.[15] Sunil Kumar et al.(2011) interpret this product as the present-day paneer. According to them, paneer is indigenous to the north-western part of South Asia and was introduced in India by Afghan and Iranian travellers.[1] Another theory is that the Portuguese may have introduced the technique of \"breaking\" milk with acid to Bengal in the 17th century. Thus, according to this theory, Indian acid-set cheeses such as paneer and chhena were first prepared in Bengal, under Portuguese influence.[7][16][17] A type of smoked cheese called Bandel cheese was introduced by the Portuguese in Bengal, which is distinct from paneer.[18] Paneer is prepared by adding food acid, such as lemon juice, vinegar, citric acid or dahi (yogurt),[21] to hot milk to separate the curds from the whey. The curds are drained in muslin or cheesecloth and the excess water is pressed out. The resulting paneer is dipped in chilled water for 2\u20133 hours to improve its texture and appearance. From this point, the preparation of paneer diverges based on its use and regional tradition. In North Indian cuisines, the curds are wrapped in cloth, placed under a heavy weight such as a stone slab for two to three hours, and then cut into cubes for use in curries. Pressing for a shorter time (approximately 20 minutes) results in a softer, fluffier cheese. In Bengali, Odia and other East Indian cuisines, the chhena are beaten or kneaded by hand into a dough-like consistency, heavily salted and hardened to produce paneer (called ponir), which is typically eaten in slices at teatime with biscuits or various types of bread, deep-fried in a light batter or used in cooking. In the area surrounding the city of Surat in Gujarat, surti paneer is made by draining the curds and ripening them in whey for 12 to 36 hours. Paneer is the most common type of cheese used in traditional cuisines from the Indian subcontinent. It is sometimes wrapped in dough and deep-fried or served with either spinach (palak paneer) or peas (mattar paneer). Paneer dishes can be sweet, like shahi paneer, or spicy/hot, like chilli paneer. Some paneer recipes include: Anari, a fresh mild whey cheese produced in Cyprus, is very similar in taste and texture to fresh Indian paneer. Circassian cheese is produced using a similar method and is close in consistency to paneer, but is usually salted. Farmer cheese (pressed curds) and firm versions of quark are similar except that they are made from cultured milk and may be salted. Although many Indians translate \"paneer\" into \"cottage cheese\", cottage cheese is made using rennet extracted from the stomach of ruminants, and cow's skim milk. Queso blanco or queso fresco are often recommended as substitutes in the Americas and Spain as they are more commercially available in many American markets. Queso blanco can be a closer match, as it is acid-set while queso fresco frequently uses rennet at a lower temperature. Both are generally salted, unlike paneer. It is also similar to unsalted halloumi.", "Milagai Podi": " Idli podi, chutney pudi, or milagai podi (Tamil: \u0b87\u0b9f\u0bcd\u0bb2\u0bbf\u0baa\u0bcd \u0baa\u0bca\u0b9f\u0bbf; Malayalam: \u0d07\u0d21\u0d4d\u0d21\u0d32\u0d3f \u0d2a\u0d4a\u0d1f\u0d3f;Telugu: \u0c15\u0c3e\u0c30\u0c02 \u0c2a\u0c4a\u0c21\u0c3f:Kannada: \u0c9a\u0c9f\u0ccd\u0ca8\u0cbf \u0caa\u0cc1\u0ca1\u0cbf) is a coarse spice powder, originating from the Indian subcontinent, with a  mixture of ground dry spices that typically contains dried chilis, black gram, chickpeas, salt and sesame seeds. The spice mix is commonly referred to in informal speech as \"gunpowder\" or chutney powder.[1] It is generally mixed with gingelly (sesame) oil or melted ghee when it is served alongside idli or dosa.[2] This Indian cuisine\u2013related article is a stub. You can help Wikipedia by expanding it.", "Coconut Chutney": " Coconut chutney is a south Indian chutney, a side-dish or a condiment,[1] common in the Indian subcontinent. The condiment is made with coconut pulp ground with other ingredients such as green chillies, tamarind, salt, coriander and water.[1] Coconut chutney is made with both red chillies or green chillies. It is served with dosas,\nidli, bajji, bonda, and vada.[2] In Karnataka, coconut chutney is also served with rice dishes such as pulao, puliyogare, tomato baath, and vangi baath.  This Indian cuisine\u2013related article is a stub. You can help Wikipedia by expanding it.", "Tomato Chutney": " A chutney (romanised: chatni Hindi: \u091a\u091f\u0928\u0940 romanised: chatnee Urdu: \u0686\u0679\u0646\u06cc romanised: chatnee) is a spread typically associated with cuisines of the Indian subcontinent. Chutneys are made in a wide variety of forms, such as a tomato relish, a ground peanut garnish, yogurt, or curd, cucumber, spicy coconut, spicy onion, or mint dipping sauce. A common variant in Anglo-Indian cuisine uses a tart fruit such as sharp apples, rhubarb or damson pickle made milder by an equal weight of sugar (usually demerara, turbinado or brown sugar to replace jaggery in some Indian sweet chutneys). Vinegar was added to the recipe for English-style chutney that traditionally aims to give a long shelf life so that autumn fruit can be preserved for use throughout the year (as are jams, jellies and pickles) or to be sold as a commercial product. Indian pickles use mustard oil as a pickling agent, but Anglo-Indian style chutney uses malt or cider vinegar which produces a milder product. In Western cuisine, chutney is often eaten with hard cheese or with cold meats and fowl, typically in cold pub lunches.[1] The word chutney derives from Hindi \u091a\u091f\u0928\u0940 cha\u1e6dn\u012b, deriving from \u091a\u093e\u091f\u0928\u093e ch\u0101\u1e6dn\u0101 'to lick' or 'to eat with appetite'.[2][3] In India, chutney refers to fresh and pickled preparations indiscriminately; however, several Indian languages use the word for fresh preparations only. In India, chutneys can be either made alongside pickles that are matured in the sun for up to two weeks and kept up to a year or, more commonly, are freshly made from fresh ingredients that can be kept a couple of days or a week in the refrigerator. In Tamil Nadu, thogayal or thuvayal (Tamil) are preparations similar to chutney but with a pasty consistency. In Andhra Pradesh, it is also called pacchadi. In Kerala it is also called chammanthi and in Telangana it is called tokku or also pacchadi. Thengai chutney, a coconut-based chutney, is the one being referred to when only 'chutney' is said. Medicinal plants that are believed to have a beneficial effect are sometimes made into chutneys, for example pirandai thuvayal[4] or ridged gourd chutney (peerkangai thuvayal or beerakaaya tokku).[5] Bitter gourd can also serve as a base for a chutney which is like a relish[6] or, as a dried powder.[7] Occasionally, chutneys that contrast in taste and colour can be served together\u2014a favourite combination being a green mint and chili chutney with a contrasting sweet brown tamarind and date chutney.[8][9][10][11][12] Chutneys may be ground with a mortar and pestle or an ammikkal (Tamil). Spices are added and ground, usually in a particular order; the wet paste thus made is saut\u00e9ed in vegetable oil, usually gingelly (sesame) or peanut oil. Electric blenders or food processors can be used as labour-saving alternatives to the stone grinding technique. Western-style chutneys are usually fruit, vinegar, and sugar cooked down to a reduction, with added flavourings. These may include sugar, salt, garlic, tamarind, onion or ginger.[13] Western-style chutneys originated from Anglo-Indians at the time of the British Raj. They recreated Indian chutneys using English orchard fruits\u2014sour cooking apples and rhubarb, for example. They would often contain dried fruit: raisins, currants, and sultanas. They were a way to use a glut of ripened fruit and preserving techniques were similar to sweet fruit preserves using approximately an equal weight of fruit and sugar, the vinegar and sugar acting as preservatives. South Indian chutney powders are made from roasted dried lentils to be sprinkled on idlis and dosas.[14] Peanut chutneys can be made wet or as a dry powder.[15][16] Spices commonly used in chutneys include fenugreek, coriander (also called cilantro), cumin, and asafoetida (hing). Other prominent ingredients and combinations include coriander, capsicum, mint (coriander and mint chutneys are often called \u0939\u0930\u093e hara chutney, Hindi for \"green\"), Tamarind or imli (often called meethi chutney, as \u092e\u093f\u0920\u093e\u0908 meethi in Hindi means \"sweet\"), sooth (or saunth, made with dates and ginger), coconut, onion, prune, tomato, red chili, green chili, mango, lime (made from whole, unripe limes), garlic, coconut, peanut, dahi (yogurt), green tomato, dhaniya pudina (cilantro and mint), peanut (shengdana chutney in Marathi), ginger, red chili powder, tomato onion chutney,[17] cilantro, mint coconut chutney,[18] and apricot.[19] Major Grey's Chutney is a type of sweet and spicy chutney popular in the United States. The recipe was reportedly created by a 19th-century British Army officer of the same name (likely apocryphal) who presumably had resided for a period of time in the Raj. Its characteristic ingredients are mango, raisins, vinegar, lime juice, onion, tamarind extract, sweetening and spices. Several companies produce a Major Grey's Chutney, in India, the UK and the US. Similar in preparation and usage to a pickle, simple spiced chutneys can be dated to 500 BC.[20] Originating in India,[21] this method of preserving food was subsequently adopted by the Romans and British thanks to their encounters and contacts with the Indian subcontinent. As greater imports of foreign and varied foods increased into northern Europe, chutney fell out of favour in Britain. This combined with a greater ability to refrigerate fresh foods and an increasing number of glasshouses meant the British consumption of chutney and pickle was relegated to army usage and individuals residing in colonial India. Chutney resurged in popularity in England around the 1780s as an appetizer. Diego \u00c1lvarez Chanca brought back chili peppers from the Americas to Spain in 1493. He had sailed with Columbus. After discovering their medicinal properties, Chanca developed a chutney to administer them. In the early 17th century, officials of the East India Company on the Indian subcontinent subsisted on preserved foodstuffs such as lime pickles, chutneys and marmalades. (Marmalades proved unpopular due to their sweetness. They were also rare due to a lack of available sugar.) Beginning in the 17th century, fruit chutneys were shipped to various European countries as luxury goods. These imitations were called \"mangoed\" fruits or vegetables, the word 'chutney' being associated with the working class in these countries.[20] Major Grey's Chutney is thought to have been developed by a British officer who had travelled to the Indian subcontinent. The formula was eventually sold to Crosse and Blackwell, a major British food manufacturer, probably in the early 1800s.[22] In the 19th century, types of chutney like Major Grey's or Bengal Club that catered to Western tastes were shipped to Europe from the Indian subcontinent. Generally, these chutneys are fruit, vinegar, and sugar cooked down to a reduction. In Trinidad and Tobago, chutneys are mostly made from green mangoes, coconut or tamarind.[24] An eponymous music genre developed in the country.", "Pesarattu": " Pesarattu (Telugu: \u0c2a\u0c46\u0c38\u0c30\u0c1f\u0c4d\u0c1f\u0c41; lit. \u2018green gram pancake\u2019), pesara attu, pesara dosa (mung bean dosa), or cheeldo is a crepe-like bread, originating in Andhra Pradesh, India, that is a variety of dosa.[1] It is made with green gram batter, but, unlike a typical dosa, it does not contain Vigna mungo.[2] Pesarattu is eaten as breakfast and as a snack in Andhra Pradesh.[3][4] It is typically served with ginger chutney, peanut chutney or tamarind chutney. Green chilies, ginger and onions are used in variants. A pesarattu stuffed with upma is known as upma pesarattu. It is popular in Andhra Pradesh cities. Upma pesarattu is a favourite in the Coastal Andhra, region especially the West Godavari District, East Godavari District, Krishna District, Guntur District especially in Planadu regions of Guntur District, Guntur and Vijayawada cities and Visakhapatnam District. Similar variations found in North Indian cuisine are moong daal ka cheela or besan ka cheela. In Rajasthan they are commonly known as cheeldo. The first step is soaking the \"pesalu\" (moong beans) or whole green gram (a 150 ml cup of gram makes about four medium pesarattus) in water for at least four hours (maximum of seven hours). The soaked gram is then ground to a smooth paste with a couple of green chilies, a small piece of ginger, and some salt. Water is added as required. The mixture is allowed to sit for a few minutes to ensure that the interiors of the grains are fully hydrated.[5] The batter is poured onto a heated pan. The pesarattu will slowly start to get crispy over the edges and start to unstick from the pan. In professional cooking facilities, due to the high temperatures of the pan, there is usually no need to flip the pesarattu. In domestic settings, the pesarattu is usually flipped, to cook it completely. Chopped onions and chilies are sometimes added to the pesarattu by spreading them over the batter before it becomes a crepe; upma is similarly used. In some places, both upma and onions are added to pesarattu. Allam Pachadi (\u0c05\u0c32\u0c4d\u0c32\u0c02 \u0c2a\u0c1a\u0c4d\u0c1a\u0c21\u0c3f) is a kind of Ginger Pickle made from grinding fresh ginger, tamarind, jaggery, and chili pepper. It is served along with pesarattu.", "NaN": "Nan or NAN may refer to:", "Stuffed Bell Peppers": "Stuffed peppers is a dish common in many cuisines. It consists of hollowed or halved bell peppers filled with any of a variety of fillings, often including meat, vegetables, cheese, rice, or sauce. The dish is usually assembled by filling the cavities of the peppers and then cooking. The Cantonese version of stuffed peppers is part of a street food called Three Fried Stuffed Treasures (\u714e\u91c0\u4e09\u5bf6), with stuffed peppers, stuffed aubergines, and stuffed sausage. Though with different vegetables and meat, the stuffing is all the same: dace fish paste. After assembling the fish paste, it is deep-fried. It is usually served with Worcestershire sauce, or can be served without sauce.[1][2] Stuffed peppers or pimientos rellenos are part of traditional Spanish cuisine, especially that of the region of the Basque Country. Usually piquillo peppers are used.[3] The fillings might include Manchego cheese, chicken, or cod in a red sauce, with chicken likely being the most popular recipe. Stuffed peppers or peperoni ripieni are part of the Italian gastronomic tradition, especially in the southern regions and particularly in Calabria. The traditional Calabrian recipe, called pipi chini, involves the use of round bell peppers, and the filling is made with breadcrumbs, parsley, basil, Grana cheese, tomato, and provola cheese. Sometimes hard-boiled egg, anchovies or ground meat are also added.[4] Stuffed peppers (bharvan mirch or bharva hari mirch) is one of several stuffed vegetable (bharvan subji) dishes.[5] It consists of bell peppers stuffed with cooked meat, potatoes, and onions and seasoned with chili, turmeric, coriander, cilantro, salt, and lemon juice. The peppers are then either browned in a tava (frying pan) or baked in an oven until the peppers are scorched. Mirchi bajji or pakora is a chaat (street food) item and is a hot favorite during the monsoon and cooler months. In  Mumbai and western areas, the big green chilli pepper is stuffed with a roasted, spiced flour mix and fried. In the South, the big green chillies, similar to Hatch chili peppers, are dipped in a flour batter and fried. It may be accompanied by chutneys and sauces. In Andhra Pradesh and Tamil Nadu, some of the smaller but more potent chillies are also stuffed and fried, especially as a side to rice. Dolma is a family of stuffed dishes from Ottoman cuisine that can be served warm or cold. Some types of dolma are made with whole vegetables including whole peppers. Today, dolma are found in the cuisines of the Balkans, South Caucasus, Central Asia and the Levant, and the family cuisines of Sephardic and Iraqi Jews. Dolma dishes are found in Balkan, Caucasian, Arab, Israeli, Turkish, and Central Asian cuisine, and were historically part of the Ottoman palace cuisine. The word dolma, of Turkish origin, means \"something stuffed\".[6][7] Stuffed peppers in American cuisine is a dish where bell peppers (often the green, yellow, orange, and red varieties) are typically filled with a stuffing such as ground beef, mixed with bread crumbs or cooked rice, eggs, herbs, and spices (especially paprika and parsley) and cheese.[8] Recipes vary but often include hollowing out the peppers, stuffing them, covering them with cheese, and baking or alternatively cooking them on the stove top at a slow simmer in canned tomato sauce until the peppers are soft. A sauce may be served with them, often a tomato sauce, but this, too, varies greatly.[9][10] Mexican and \u201cTex-Mex\u201d cuisine has more than one stuffed pepper dish: In Guatemala, the \"pimiento\" pepper is stuffed with shredded pork and vegetables.  As the Mexican version, it is covered with egg batter and fried.  It is served with tomato sauce or inside a bread bun. There are many names for stuffed peppers in the languages of Central and Southeast Europe: The Hungarian variant, t\u00f6lt\u00f6tt paprika, is always made with Hungarian wax pepper, which has a distinctive taste somewhat similar to lecs\u00f3. Punjena paprika (pronounced [p\u00fb\u0272ena\u02d0 p\u01ceprika]) includes a tomato sauce. In Bulgaria, stuffed peppers are usually eaten with yogurt. Another variety of stuffed peppers in Bulgaria is made with mixed white cheese and eggs instead of meat and rice as stuffing.[citation needed] In 2017, dolma making in Azerbaijan was included in the UNESCO Intangible Cultural Heritage Lists.[12] In Romanian cuisine, stuffed peppers are usually prepared with bell peppers stuffed with ground meat (usually pork), rice, onion, and other vegetables and spices and then boiled in a sauce made from cream, tomatoes, and spices.[citation needed] Traditionally in Bulgaria, the filling is made of rice steamed in advance, onions, minced meat and spices, heat-treated and crammed into pre-cleaned, washed and riddled with needle peppers. After filling of peppers, they are put in a baking dish, water is added and the dish is baked in the oven. If raw egg is added to the cooled stuffing, filled peppers can be cooked in a pan, as the pods are boiled almost steamed. Besides minced meat and rice, other fillings may be used, such as vegetables (for example leek) and rice, beans, or fresh cheese and eggs. The peppers themselves can be either fresh or dried. Dried red peppers are used especially in southeastern Serbia around Pirot and Dimitrovgrad, often in winter. Stuffed peppers are often cooked by Romani people and is a popular dish in Romani cuisine.[13]", "Gobi Manchurian": "Manchurian is a class of Indian Chinese dishes made by roughly chopping and deep-frying ingredients such as chicken, cauliflower (gobi), prawns, fish, mutton, and paneer, and then saut\u00e9eing them in a sauce flavored with soy sauce.[2][3] Manchurian is the result of the adaptation of Chinese cooking and seasoning techniques to suit Indian tastes. It has become a staple of Indian Chinese cuisine. The word \"Manchurian\" means native or inhabitant of Manchuria (in northeast China); the dish, however, is a creation of Chinese restaurants in India, and bears little resemblance to traditional Manchu cuisine or Northeastern Chinese cuisine.[4] It is said to have been invented in 1975 by Nelson Wang, a cook at the Cricket Club of India in Mumbai, when a customer asked him to create a new dish, rather than what was on the menu.[5]  Wang described the invention process as starting from the basic ingredients of an Indian dish, namely chopped garlic, ginger, and green chilis, but next, instead of adding garam masala, he put in soy sauce, followed by cornstarch and the chicken itself.[6] The dish is popular across South Asia.[7] A popular vegetarian variant replaces chicken with cauliflower,[3] and is commonly known as gobi manchurian. Other vegetarian variants include mushroom, baby corn, and veggie ball as the main ingredient.[citation needed] There are two different variants of Manchurian, dry or semi dry and with gravy. Both variants are prepared by using common ingredients like corn flour, maida flour, spring onion, bell peppers, soy sauce, chili sauce, minced garlic, ground pepper, etc. and has typical garnish of spring onion. Some recipes call for use of monosodium glutamate (MSG) to increase the taste profile, though there are those who avoid it due to the common misconception that it causes headaches.[8] Its taste can vary from mildly spicy to hot and fiery based on the recipe and personal preference. The fritters are served comparatively dry, often as a snack or starter with tomato ketchup as dipping sauce. It is popular among alcohol drinkers as a bar snack, and has been described as \"an excellent drinking companion to cold beer\".[9] The fritters are coated with a thick sauce like spicy gravy curry made of corn flour. It is generally served with varieties of rice dishes like steamed rice, Chinese fried rice, or Sichuan fried rice, as the main course.", "Lamb Curry": "Mutton curry (also referred to as kosha mangsho,[1]  lamb curry,[2] or goat curry[3][4]) is a dish that is prepared from goat meat (or sometimes lamb meat) and vegetables.[5] The dish is found in different variations across all states, countries and regions of the Indian subcontinent and the Caribbean. Mutton curry was originally prepared putting all the ingredients together in a earthen pot and slow cooking the whole curry by wood fire on a clay oven.[6] Today it is cooked using pressure cookers and slow cookers after briefly saut\u00e9ing all the ingredients and spices in a big wok.[6] The steadily cooked mutton becomes more tender than normally cooked mutton. Mutton curry is generally served with rice or with Indian breads, such as naan or parotta.[7] The dish can also be served with ragi, a cereal.[8] Common ingredients used to prepare mutton curry[9] include: mutton or goat meat, salt, turmeric powder, mustard oil, ginger garlic paste, dahi (yogurt), assortment of spices, onion, chilli, tomato, and coriander leaves.[10] In Odisha, mutton curry is always made of khasi goat meat (meat of young castrated male goat). There are many varieties of goat meat curries prepared in Odisha. Simple and flavorful ingredients are used to prepare the curry and usually served with roti, naan or in Western Odisha, puffed rice (mudhi). Some of the popular curries are:[11] While mutton curry is usually eaten with rice, in Western Odisha, Mangsa Kash\u0101 is particularly relished with mudhi (puffed rice). Mangsa Kash\u0101 is said to be the predecessor of the popular Bengali goat curry dish known as Kosha Mangsho most probably introduced by the Odia cooks who moved to West Bengal during the British rule to work in the kitchens of Bengali families.[12] Mutton is typically cooked in Bihar in curried form. In addition to fish and chicken, mutton is common in Bihari cuisine. Mutton curry is traditionally served with Malpua on Holi,[13] while it is eaten with rice in a routine everyday meal. In Champaran, mutton is cooked in a sealed earthen pot as a one-pot curry.[14] Mutton curry has a special place in Surati cuisine. A rich mutton dish known as Tapelu which finds its origins in the kitchens of the Surati Khatri community, is often cooked in large batches, especially during festivities.[15] [16] Goat offal also finds a place in the cuisine of Surat.[15] Kosha mangsho is the Bengali version of mutton curry. It traditionally has less juice and more gravy than mutton curries eaten in other parts of India.[17] This dish is prepared in a kosha style, which involves retaining the mutton's flavor and moisture using slow cooking and saut\u00e9eing methods.[18] Kosha mangsho is traditionally prepared as part of the celebration of Kali Puja,[19] a festival dedicated to the Hindu goddess Kali, celebrated on the New Moon day of the Hindu month Kartik. Railway mutton curry is a British Raj colonial-era dish that was served on long-distance trains.[20][21][22] The dish was served with dinner rolls.[20] Tamarind was originally used to extend its shelf life.[20] Some restaurants serve the dish in present-day times, such as Oh! Calcutta! restaurant in Kolkata, India.[23][24] Railway mutton curry is prepared using a coconut milk base.[24] Black Mutton curry (also referred to as konkani black mutton) is a dish that is prepared from goat or lamb meat, charred coconuts, and a signature spice blend. The regional dish originated in the Konkani[25] district of Maharashtra, India. Black Mutton curry was originally made by preparing a black spice paste consisting of charred coconuts, onions and peppers with spices which was then cooked low and slow in a cast iron wok. The cooked paste was added with the mutton along with fresh herbs and spices in an earthen pot and cooked low and slow till tender. The curry is typically served with breads such as Bhakari, Chapati, Pav or rice. The dish utilizes a unique blend of spices called the Maharashtrian garam masala, which consists of cardamom, nutmeg, khus khus (poppy seeds), saunth (dried ginger), and many other Mughlai spices which lend the black mouton an intoxicating flavor and a robust color.[26] In 2012, in the Midlands, England, trading standards officers working undercover went to twenty restaurants that were randomly chosen and bought 39 lamb curry and kebab dishes.[27] Four of the dishes contained no lamb, instead using a mixture that contained beef, pork or chicken.[27] In the investigation, it was found that only three lamb curries out of the nineteen tested contained only lamb. Most were found to consist of a mixture of lamb with beef or chicken.[27] Additionally, all of the twenty lamb kebabs that were sampled contained meats in addition to lamb that was mixed with it, such as beef, pork or chicken.[27] Hot", "Sannas": "Sannas (Sannoes, Sanna,[1] Sannah,[2] Sannoe, Sanoe[3]) was a cotton cloth from the 17th century. This fabric was plain weave cotton, which was produced in the Indian state of Orissa. After 1640, huge quantities of Sannas were exported to Europe.[4] Sannas, Cassas, and Bafta were among the Indian textiles exported for shirting and sheeting uses.[5] Sanna was mostly white or blue in colour.[1] Bengal's description of piece goods for the Cape market includes Sannoes in the list along with Nainsook, and different variations of Bafta such as  ''Chittabully Baftaes, and Callapatty Baftaes''.[6]", "Crab Curry": "  Crabs are decapod crustaceans of the infraorder Brachyura, which typically have a very short projecting tail-like abdomen, usually hidden entirely under the thorax (brachyura means \"short tail\" in Greek).[a] They live in all the world's oceans, in freshwater, and on land, are generally covered with a thick exoskeleton, and have a single pair of pincers on each arm. They first appeared during the Jurassic period, around 200 million years ago. Crabs are generally covered with a thick exoskeleton, composed primarily of highly mineralized chitin.[4][5] Behind their pair of chelae (claws) are six walking legs and then two swimming legs. The crab breathes through gills on its underside; gills must be at least moist to work. Crabs vary in size from the pea crab, a few millimeters wide, to the Japanese spider crab, with a leg span up to 4\u00a0m (13\u00a0ft).[6] Several other groups of crustaceans with similar appearances \u2013 such as king crabs and porcelain crabs \u2013 are not true crabs, but have evolved features similar to true crabs through a process known as carcinisation.[7][8][9][10] Crabs are found in all of the world's oceans, as well as in fresh water and on land, particularly in tropical regions. About 850 species are freshwater crabs.[11] Crabs often show marked sexual dimorphism. Males often have larger claws,[12] a tendency that is particularly pronounced in the fiddler crabs of the genus Uca (Ocypodidae). In fiddler crabs, males have one greatly enlarged claw used for communication, particularly for attracting a mate.[13] Another conspicuous difference is the form of the pleon (abdomen); in most male crabs, this is narrow and triangular in form, while females have a broader, rounded abdomen.[14] This is because female crabs brood fertilised eggs on their pleopods. Crabs attract a mate through chemical (pheromones), visual, acoustic, or vibratory means. Pheromones are used by most fully aquatic crabs, while terrestrial and semiterrestrial crabs often use visual signals, such as fiddler crab males waving their large claws to attract females. The vast number of brachyuran crabs have internal fertilisation and mate belly-to-belly. For many aquatic species, mating takes place just after the female has moulted and is still soft. Females can store the sperm for a long time before using it to fertilise their eggs. When fertilisation has taken place, the eggs are released onto the female's abdomen, below the tail flap, secured with a sticky material. In this location, they are protected during embryonic development. Females carrying eggs are called \"berried\" since the eggs resemble round berries. When development is complete, the female releases the newly hatched larvae into the water, where they are part of the plankton. The release is often timed with the tidal and light/dark diurnal cycle.[15][16] The free-swimming tiny zoea larvae can float and take advantage of water currents. They have a spine, which probably reduces the rate of predation by larger animals. The zoea of most species must find food, but some crabs provide enough yolk in the eggs that the larval stages can continue to live off the yolk. Each species has a particular number of zoeal stages, separated by moults, before they change into a megalopa stage, which resembles an adult crab, except for having the abdomen (tail) sticking out behind. After one more moult, the crab is a juvenile, living on the bottom rather than floating in the water. This last moult, from megalopa to juvenile, is critical, and it must take place in a habitat that is suitable for the juvenile to survive.[17]:\u200a63\u201377 Most species of terrestrial crabs must migrate down to the ocean to release their larvae; in some cases, this entails very extensive migrations. After living for a short time as larvae in the ocean, the juveniles must do this migration in reverse. In many tropical areas with land crabs, these migrations often result in considerable roadkill of migrating crabs.[17]:\u200a113\u2013114 Once crabs have become juveniles, they still have to keep moulting many more times to become adults. They are covered with a hard shell, which would otherwise prevent growth. The moult cycle is coordinated by hormones. When preparing for moult, the old shell is softened and partly eroded away, while the rudimentary beginnings of a new shell form under it. At the time of moulting, the crab takes in a lot of water to expand and crack open the old shell at a line of weakness along the back edge of the carapace. The crab must then extract all of itself \u2013 including its legs, mouthparts, eyestalks, and even the lining of the front and back of the digestive tract \u2013 from the old shell. This is a difficult process that takes many hours, and if a crab gets stuck, it will die. After freeing itself from the old shell (now called an exuvia), the crab is extremely soft and hides until its new shell has hardened. While the new shell is still soft, the crab can expand it to make room for future growth.[17]:\u200a78\u201379 Crabs typically walk sideways[18] (hence the term crabwise), because of the articulation of the legs which makes a sidelong gait more efficient.[19] Some crabs walk forward or backward, including raninids,[20] Libinia emarginata[21] and Mictyris platycheles.[18] Some crabs, like the Portunidae and Matutidae, are also capable of swimming,[22] the Portunidae especially so as their last pair of walking legs are flattened into swimming paddles.[17]:\u200a96 Crabs are mostly active animals with complex behaviour patterns such as communicating by drumming or waving their pincers. Crabs tend to be aggressive toward one another, and males often fight to gain access to females.[23] On rocky seashores, where nearly all caves and crevices are occupied, crabs may also fight over hiding holes.[24] Fiddler crabs (genus Uca) dig burrows in sand or mud, which they use for resting, hiding, and mating, and to defend against intruders.[17]:\u200a28\u201329,\u200a99 Crabs are omnivores, feeding primarily on algae,[25] and taking any other food, including molluscs, worms, other crustaceans, fungi, bacteria, and detritus, depending on their availability and the crab species. For many crabs, a mixed diet of plant and animal matter results in the fastest growth and greatest fitness.[26][27] Some species are more specialised in their diets, based in plankton, clams or fish.[17]:\u200a85 Crabs are known to work together to provide food and protection for their family, and during mating season to find a comfortable spot for the female to release her eggs.[28] Crabs make up 20% of all marine crustaceans caught, farmed, and consumed worldwide, amounting to 1.5\u00a0million tonnes annually. One species, Portunus trituberculatus, accounts for one-fifth of that total. Other commercially important taxa include Portunus pelagicus, several species in the genus Chionoecetes, the blue crab (Callinectes sapidus), Charybdis spp., Cancer pagurus, the Dungeness crab (Metacarcinus magister), and Scylla serrata, each of which yields more than 20,000\u00a0tonnes annually.[29] In some crab species, meat is harvested by manually twisting and pulling off one or both claws and returning the live crab to the water in the knowledge that the crab may survive and regenerate the claws.[30][31][32] Crabs are prepared and eaten as a dish in many different ways all over the world. Some species are eaten whole, including the shell, such as soft-shell crab; with other species, just the claws or legs are eaten. The latter is particularly common for larger crabs, such as the snow crab. In many cultures, the roe of the female crab is also eaten, which usually appears orange or yellow in fertile crabs. This is popular in Southeast Asian cultures, some Mediterranean and Northern European cultures, and on the East, Chesapeake, and Gulf Coasts of the United States. In some regions, spices improve the culinary experience. In Southeast Asia and the Indosphere, masala crab and chilli crab are examples of heavily spiced dishes. In the Chesapeake Bay region, blue crab is often steamed with Old Bay Seasoning. Alaskan king crab or snow crab legs are usually simply boiled and served with garlic or lemon butter. For the British dish dressed crab, the crab meat is extracted and placed inside the hard shell. One American way to prepare crab meat is by extracting it and adding varying amounts of binders, such as egg white, cracker meal, mayonnaise, or mustard, creating a crab cake.  Crabs can also be made into a bisque, a global dish of French origin which in its authentic form includes in the broth the pulverized shells of the shellfish from which it is made. Imitation crab, also called surimi, is made from minced fish meat that is crafted and colored to resemble crab meat. While it is sometimes disdained among some elements of the culinary industry as an unacceptably low-quality substitute for real crab, this does not hinder its popularity, especially as a sushi ingredient in Japan and South Korea, and in home cooking, where cost is often a chief concern.[33] Indeed, surimi is an important source of protein in most East and Southeast Asian cultures, appearing in staple ingredients such as fish balls and fish cake. Whether crustaceans as a whole experience pain or not is a scientific debate that has ethical implications for crab dish preparation. Crabs are very often boiled alive as part of the cooking process. Advocates for Animals, a Scottish animal welfare group, stated in 2005 that \"scientific evidence ... strongly suggests that there is a potential for decapod crustaceans and cephalopods to experience pain and suffering\". This is primarily due to \"The likelihood that decapod crustaceans can feel pain [which] is supported by the fact that they have been shown to have opioid receptors and to respond to opioids (analgesics such as morphine) in a similar way to vertebrates.\"  Similarities between decapod and vertebrate stress systems and behavioral responses to noxious stimuli were given as additional evidence for the capacity of decapods to experience pain.[34] In 2005 a review of the literature by the Norwegian Scientific Committee for Food Safety tentatively concluded that \"it is unlikely that [lobsters] can feel pain,\" though they note that \"there is apparently a paucity of exact knowledge on sentience in crustaceans, and more research is needed.\" This conclusion is based on the lobster's simple nervous system. The report assumes that the violent reaction of lobsters to boiling water is a reflex response (i.e. does not involve conscious perception) to noxious stimuli.[35] The earliest unambiguous crab fossils date from the Early Jurassic, with the oldest being Eocarcinus from the early Pliensbachian of Britain, which likely represents a stem-group lineage, as it lacks several key morphological features that define modern crabs.[37][38] Most Jurassic crabs are only known from dorsal (top half of the body) carapaces, making it difficult to determine their relationships.[39] Crabs radiated in the Late Jurassic, corresponding with an increase in reef habitats, though they would decline at the end of the Jurassic as the result of the decline of reef ecosystems. Crabs increased in diversity through the Cretaceous and represented the dominant group of decapods by the end of the period.[40] The crab infraorder Brachyura belongs to the group Reptantia, which consists of the walking/crawling decapods (lobsters and crabs).  Brachyura is the sister clade to the infraorder Anomura, which contains the hermit crabs and relatives.  The cladogram below shows Brachyura's placement within the larger order Decapoda, from analysis by Wolfe et al., 2019.[41] Dendrobranchiata (prawns) Stenopodidea (boxer shrimp) Procarididea Caridea (true shrimp) Achelata (spiny lobsters, slipper lobsters) Polychelida (benthic crustaceans) Astacidea (lobsters, crayfish) Axiidea (mud shrimp, ghost shrimp, or burrowing shrimp) Gebiidea (mud lobsters and mud shrimp) Anomura (hermit crabs and others) Brachyura (crabs) Brachyura is separated into several sections, with the basal Dromiacea diverging the earliest in the evolutionary history, around the Late Triassic or Early Jurassic.  The group consisting of Raninoida and Cyclodorippoida split off next, during the Jurassic period.  The remaining clade Eubrachyura then divided during the Cretaceous period into Heterotremata and Thoracotremata.\nA summary of the high-level internal relationships within Brachyura can be shown in the cladogram below:\n[42]\n[41] Dromiacea Raninoida Cyclodorippoida Heterotremata Thoracotremata There is a no consensus on the relationships of the subsequent superfamilies and families.  The proposed cladogram below is from analysis by Tsang et al, 2014:[42] Dromiidae (may be paraphyletic) Dynomenidae Homolidae (paraphyletic) Latreilliidae Raninidae Cyclodorippidae Cymonomidae Potamonautidae Potamidae Gecarcinucidae Pseudothelphusidae  Trichodactylidae (freshwater crabs) Orithyiidae Belliidae Chasmocarcinidae Retroplumidae Ethusidae Dorippidae Leucosiidae Inachidae Epialtidae (paraphyletic) Majidae / Mithracidae Corystidae Euryplacidae Matutidae Calappidae Parthenopidae Cancridae Carpiliidae Aethridae Pseudocarcinus of Menippidae Menippe of Menippidae Polybiidae Portunidae Tanaochelidae Galenidae Pilumnidae Mathildellidae Eriphiidae Oziidae Vultocinidae Trapeziidae Goneplacidae Scalopidiidae Xanthidae (paraphyletic) Panopeidae Pinnotheridae Dotillidae Percnidae Xenograpsidae Cryptochiridae Ocypodidae Glyptograpsidae Grapsidae Plagusiidae Gecarcinidae Sesarmidae Mictyridae Varunidae Macrophthalmidae The infraorder Brachyura contains approximately 7,000 species in 98 families,[42][22] as many as the remainder of the Decapoda.[43] The evolution of crabs is characterized by an increasingly robust body, and a reduction in the abdomen. Although many other groups have undergone similar processes, carcinisation is most advanced in crabs. The telson is no longer functional in crabs, and the uropods are absent, having probably evolved into small devices for holding the reduced abdomen tight against the sternum. In most decapods, the gonopores (sexual openings) are found on the legs. Since crabs use their first two pairs of pleopods (abdominal appendages) for sperm transfer, this arrangement has changed. As the male abdomen evolved into a slimmer shape, the gonopores have moved toward the midline, away from the legs, and onto the sternum.[44] A similar change occurred, independently, with the female gonopores. The movement of the female gonopore to the sternum defines the clade Eubrachyura, and the later change in the position of the male gonopore defines the Thoracotremata. It is still a subject of debate whether a monophyletic group is formed by those crabs where the female, but not male, gonopores are situated on the sternum.[43] Numbers of extant and extinct (\u2020) species are given in brackets.[1] The superfamily Eocarcinoidea, containing Eocarcinus and Platykotta, was formerly thought to contain the oldest crabs; it is now considered part of the Anomura.[45] Recent studies have found the following superfamilies and families to not be monophyletic, but rather paraphyletic or polyphyletic:[42][41][48][47] Both the constellation Cancer and the astrological sign Cancer are named after the crab, and depicted as a crab. William Parsons, 3rd Earl of Rosse drew the Crab Nebula in 1848 and noticed its similarity to the animal; the Crab Pulsar lies at the centre of the nebula.[49] The Moche people of ancient Peru worshipped nature, especially the sea,[50] and often depicted crabs in their art.[51] In Greek mythology, Karkinos was a crab that came to the aid of the Lernaean Hydra as it battled Heracles. One of Rudyard Kipling's Just So Stories, The Crab that Played with the Sea, tells the story of a gigantic crab who made the waters of the sea go up and down, like the tides.[52]  The auction for the crab quota in 2019, Russia is the largest revenue auction in the world except the spectrum auctions.[citation needed] In Malay mythology (as related by Hugh Clifford to Walter William Skeat), ocean tides are believed to be caused by water rushing in and out of a hole in the Navel of the Seas (Pusat Tasek), where \"there sits a gigantic crab which twice a day gets out in order to search for food\".[53]:\u200a7\u20138 The Kapsiki people of North Cameroon use the way crabs handle objects for divination.[citation needed] The term crab mentality is derived from a type of detrimental social behavior observed in crabs. ", "Country Captain": "Country captain is a curried chicken and rice dish, which is popular in the Southern United States. It was introduced to the United States through Charleston, Savannah, New York City, and Philadelphia, but has origins in the Indian subcontinent. The dish was also included in the U.S. military's Meal, Ready-to-Eat packs from 2000 to 2004, in honor of it being a favorite dish of George S. Patton. It has also appeared on television shows in both the United States and in the United Kingdom, with chefs Bobby Flay, Atul Kochhar and Cyrus Todiwala all cooking the dish. Todiwala served his version to Queen Elizabeth II as part of her Diamond Jubilee celebrations. In its basic form, country captain is a mild stew made with browned chicken pieces, onions, and curry powder.[1] Almonds and golden raisins or zante currants are usually added.[2] Many versions also call for tomatoes, garlic, and bell peppers.[3] The dish is served over white rice.[1] With the exception of the rice, it is meant to be cooked all in the same pot.[2] Chef Mamrej Khan has referred to the dish as one of the first fusion dishes to be developed, making it part of the Anglo-Indian cuisine.[4] Country captain originated in India as a simple spatchcock poultry or game recipe involving onions and curry and possibly enjoyed by British officers.[4][5] One theory is that an early 19th-century British sea captain, possibly from the East India Company,[6] working in the spice trade introduced it to the American South via the port of Savannah. The dish remains popular amongst the communities in Mumbai, India.[4] The \"country\" part of the dish's name dates from when the term referred to things of Indian origin instead of British, and so the term \"country captain\" would have meant a captain of Indian origin, a trader along the coasts of India.[5] Others claim that the word \"captain\" in the title is simply a corruption of the word \"capon\".[7] In 1991, The New York Times columnist Molly O'Neill researched the origin of the dish known as country captain,[8] which had been a steady feature in southern cookbooks since the 1950s. Working with Cecily Brownstone, they discovered that the dish originally published in the United States in the pages of Miss Leslie\u2019s New Cookery Book published in Philadelphia in 1857.[9] The recipe required a \"fine full-grown fowl\".[10] It also appeared in the kitchens of  Alessandro Filippini, who was a chef with a restaurant on Wall Street in the 19th century.[9] Fans of the dish have included Franklin D. Roosevelt, who encountered country captain while visiting the Little White House in Warm Springs, Georgia.[11] Roosevelt introduced it to George S. Patton, and it was Patton's love for the dish which subsequently resulted in it being added in his honor to the U.S. Army's Meal, Ready-to-Eat field rations in 2000.[9] A variety of Southern chefs have recipes for the dish, including Paul Prudhomme,[12] Paula Deen and Emeril Lagasse.[2][13] The dish was featured on an episode of Throwdown! with Bobby Flay in season 6 guest-starring Matt and Ted Lee.[14] It also appeared on the BBC One cooking show, Saturday Kitchen, with chef Atul Kochhar cooking the regular chicken and rice version of the dish.[1] Chef Cyrus Todiwala cooked a variation of country captain on Saturday Kitchen. His version was similar to shepherd's pie, in that the meat was baked under a layer of potato.[15] He had previously cooked the dish for Queen Elizabeth II and the Duke of Edinburgh at Krishna Avanti Primary School in Harrow as part of the Queen's Diamond Jubilee celebrations in 2012. That version of the dish used a rare breed of lamb from the Orkney Islands which had been fed on seaweed.[16] The dish is also now on the menu of Todiwala's London restaurant, Caf\u00e9 Spice Namast\u00e9.[17]", "Murag": "Murak (Persian: \u0645\u0648\u0631\u0643, also Romanized as M\u016brak; also known as M\u016brag)[1] is a village in Padena-ye Vosta Rural District, Padena District, Semirom County, Isfahan Province, Iran.

[2] Jalfrezi means \"hot-fry\".[3] It consists of a main ingredient such as meat, fish, paneer or vegetables, stir-fried and served in a thick spicy sauce that includes green chilli peppers.[4] Common further ingredients include bell peppers, onions and tomatoes. Jalfrezi recipes appeared in cookbooks of British India as a way of using up leftovers by frying them with chilli and onion.[5] This English-language usage derived from the colloquial Bengali term jh\u0101l porhez\u012b: jh\u0101l means spicy food; porhez\u012b means suitable for a diet.[6][7] Jalfrezi is usually prepared by stir-frying ingredients, a technique introduced to the region by Chinese cuisine. Jalfrezi is typically made from green peppers, onions, and tomatoes.[8] Additional ingredients include spices like paprika and coriander.[9] Vegetables or meat are then stir-fried into the mix.[10] Jalfrezi is often served alongside pulao.[2] In a survey in 2011, jalfrezi was rated the most popular dish in UK Indian and broader South Asian restaurants.[11][12]  This Bangladeshi cuisine\u2013related article is a stub.

Hot", "Baingan Bharta": " Baigan bharta, also spelled baingan bharta or baigan chokha[1] (mashed eggplant)[a] is an Indian dish prepared by mashing or mincing grilled eggplant (baigan) with tomato, onion, herbs and spices, with variations being common from chef to chef.[b] Traditionally, cooking the eggplants over charcoals, inside of a tandoor, barbecue grill or oven, or even directly applying flame to the outside of the fruit infuses the dish with a smoky flavour; the blackened skin is then easily peeled and the eggplant may be further prepared. Baigan bharta is most often grilled, minced eggplant stewed with chopped tomato, browned onion or shallots, ginger, garlic, cumin, and topped with lime or lemon juice, fresh cilantro (coriander leaves) and sliced fresh green chili pepper. Depending on region and personal tastes, ghee (clarified butter) may be used in preparation of the dish. In some regions where mustard oil is popular, this may be used, though it possesses a powerful flavour and aroma. Most chefs use a neutral, high-smoking-point vegetable oil like canola or sunflower oil.[3] Traditionally, the dish is eaten by hand with flatbread (specifically roti, naan or paratha), and can also be served with a variety of rice dishes, like biryani, khichdi or pulao. The meal will usually be rounded-out with various pickles (mango, lime, lemon, etc) as well as raita, a palate-cooling yogurt dish/condiment (similar to Greek tzatziki) with many forms, including mint, mango or cucumber preparations. In Bihar and Uttar Pradesh, it is served hot with litti or baati.[4] In India, Pakistan and Bangladesh, baigan bharta is part of the most popular cuisine items. In India, it is found in various regional styles, with ingredients varying from one region to another. Some chefs and recipes utilise seasonal mashed pumpkin, squash or sweet potato for added thickness and flavour. The dish has since spread to areas outside of India, particularly countries with high numbers of Indians and their descendants, including the United Kingdom, Australia, and parts of the United States and Canada. It is popularly eaten in the Caribbean, in places like Guyana, Jamaica and Trinidad & Tobago, where it is known as baigan chokha.[5] The dish has several regional names, such as: baigan ka bharta (Hindi: \u092c\u0948\u0917\u0928 \u0915\u093e \u092d\u0930\u0924\u093e, Urdu: \u0628\u06cc\u0646\u06af\u0646 \u06a9\u0627 \u0628\u06be\u0631\u062a\u06c1), baingan da bharrtha (Punjabi: \u0a2c\u0a48\u0a02\u0a17\u0a23 \u0a26\u0a3e \u0a2d\u0a71\u0a5c\u0a25\u0a3e), ringan no oro (Gujarati: \u0ab0\u0ac0\u0a82\u0a97\u0aa3\u0aa8\u0acb \u0a93\u0ab3\u0acb), pura begena satoni (Assamese: \u09aa\u09c1\u09f0\u09be \u09ac\u09c7\u0999\u09c7\u09a8\u09be \u099a\u09be\u099f\u09a8\u09bf) or bengena pitika (Assamese: \u09ac\u09c7\u0999\u09c7\u09a8\u09be \u09aa\u09bf\u099f\u09bf\u0995\u09be), wangyacha bharit (Marathi: \u0935\u093e\u0902\u0917\u094d\u092f\u093e\u091a\u0902 \u092d\u0930\u0940\u0924), ennegayi (Kannada: \u0c8e\u0ca3\u0ccd\u0ca3\u0cc6\u0c97\u0cbe\u0caf\u0cbf), baigana bhartta (Odia: \u0b2c\u0b3e\u0b07\u0b17\u0b23 \u0b2d\u0b30\u0b4d\u0b24\u0b4d\u0b24\u0b3e), begun bh\u00f4rta (Bengali: \u09ac\u09c7\u0997\u09c1\u09a8 \u09ad\u09b0\u09cd\u09a4\u09be), baingoin satni (Sylheti: \ua81b\ua823\ua801\ua80b\ua809\ua802\ua818 \ua80c\ua823\ua810\ua818\ua824) and olo (Gujarati). The beauty of Baigan Bharta lies in its versatility. While the core ingredients remain the same, regional variations and personal preferences lead to diverse flavor profiles. Some common variations include: Classic Baigan Bharta: This classic rendition features a vibrant spice blend of garlic, coriander, red chili powder, and cumin. Dahi Baigan Bharta: This version incorporates dahi for a creamier texture and tangy twist, often balanced with fresh cilantro and Mint leaves. Spicy Baigan Bharta: For those who love heat, additional chilies or spices like garam masala and fenugreek seeds can be added. In Gujarat, it is called ringan no oro (Gujarati: \u0ab0\u0ac0\u0a82\u0a97\u0aa3\u0aa8\u0acb \u0a93\u0ab3\u0acb), in which the eggplant is roasted, then mashed, and then saut\u00e9ed with mustard and cumin seeds, turmeric, red chilli powder, ginger and garlic and salt. It is served with bajra no rotlo (Gujarati: \u0aac\u0abe\u0a9c\u0ab0\u0abe\u0a82\u0aa8\u0acb \u0ab0\u0acb\u0a9f\u0ab2\u0acb), kadhi (a soup prepared by gram flour, curd and spices), khichadi and chhaash (Gujarati: \u0a9b\u0abe\u0ab6) (buttermilk). In Karnataka, it is called e\u1e47\u1e47eg\u0101yi and is prepared by boiling and frying a whole eggplant, and is usually served with akki rotti. In the South Indian state of Tamil Nadu, the Tamils prepare a similar dish called kathrikai thayir kothsu, in which the eggplant is cooked, mashed, and saut\u00e9ed with mustard, red chilis and sesame oil. The final step in the recipe involves adding yogurt (curds) to the mixture and dressing the dish with coriander leaves. In the Bhojpuri-speaking regions of India (such as eastern Uttar Pradesh and western Bihar), it is known as baigan ka chokha;[6] it is also popular within the Indo-Caribbean communities of Trinidad and Tobago, Suriname, and Guyana, where many descendants of indentured labourers from northern India live. In Maharashtra, especially in the northern Khandesh region, vangyache bharit as they call it is served in social gatherings including wedding ceremonies. During harvest season, a special \"bharit party\" is organised. Bharit is usually served with puri. In the Vidarbha and Khandesh regions of Maharashtra, two variants are popular: kachha (\"raw\") bharit and phodni cha (with tadka) bharit. In kachha bharit, all the ingredients except for eggplant are used uncooked. Raw spring onion, tomato, green chillies, green coriander, and sometimes fresh fenugreek leaves are mixed with flame-roasted eggplant along with raw linseed oil or peanut oil. In phodni cha bharit, the above ingredients are first fried in oil with spices; then, mashed eggplants are mixed into it and cooked together. A similar process is followed in other Indian states and Pakistan with slight variations in ingredients. In Vidarbha and Khandesh, it is considered a delicacy when the eggplants are roasted on dried cotton plant stems, a process which gives a distinct smokey flavour to the dish. The dish is served with dal, bhakri, and rice. In a protest against Bt brinjal and the introduction of genetically modified crops, volunteers from Greenpeace and Delhi's Le M\u00e9ridien hotel cooked 342 kilograms (754\u00a0lb) of organic brinjal bharta at Dilli Haat, New Delhi, on 6 September 2011. This set a world record for the largest amount of the dish produced in one occasion of preparation. A portion of the final dish was sent to Indian Prime Minister Manmohan Singh's residence, accompanied by a letter of protest containing an explanation.[7][8] 30\u201360\u00a0\u00b0C (86\u2013140\u00a0\u00b0F)", "Chicken Rezala": " Bengali cuisine is the culinary style of Bengal, that comprises Bangladesh and the Indian states of West Bengal, Tripura and Assam's Karimganj district.[1] The cuisine has been shaped by the region's diverse history and climate. It is known for its varied use of flavours including mustard oil, as well as the spread of its confectioneries and desserts.[2] There is a strong emphasis on rice as a staple,[3] with fish traditionally the most common protein. Freshwater fish are preferred to seafish, although barramundi, known as bhetki, is also common.[4] Meat is also a common protein among Bengalis with chicken and mutton meat being the most popular. Beef is popular within the muslim community. In more recent times, lentils have begun to form a significant part of the diet.[5] Many Bengali food traditions draw from social activities, such as adda, Poila Boishakh, Mezban, Iftar and Eid feast. Muslims conquered Bengal around the mid-thirteenth century, bringing with them Persian and Arabic cuisine.[6] Such dishes as biryani, korma and bhuna had once been meals of the higher courts, but the cooks of the Mughals brought their recipes to the lower and middle classes.[7] The influence was reinforced during the rule of the British Raj, where Kolkata became the place of refuge for many prominent exiled Nawabs, notably the family of Tipu Sultan from Mysore and Wajid Ali Shah, the ousted Nawab of Awadh. The exiles brought with them hundreds of cooks and masalchis (spice mixers), and as their royal patronage and wealth diminished, they became interspersed into the local population. These cooks came with the knowledge of a very wide range of spices (most notably jafran and mace), the extensive use of ghee, and marinating meat with yoghurt and chilli.[8] In Bangladesh, this food has become common fare for the population while in West Bengal, they have remained the food of professional chefs. Further innovations include chap (ribs slow cooked on a tawa), rezala (meat in a thin yogurt and cardamom gravy) and kathi roll (kebabs in a wrap).[8] The Mughals had a particular fixation on meat, bringing mutton and beef into mainstream Bengali cuisine as well as already known kinds of meat like chicken and venison.[7] Furthermore, traditional desserts had been primarily based on rice pastes and jaggery, but under Mughal influence moved towards significantly increased use of milk, cream, and sugar along with expensive spices such as cardamom and saffron.[7] In Hindu tradition, widows were not allowed to eat foods that would not be classified as \"bitter\", necessitating experiment and innovation.[9] While most Bengali castes ate meat and fish, this was barred for widows. Widows also could not use \"heating\" foods such as shallot and garlic, but ginger was allowed. This style found a core place in Bengali curries in general, both vegetarian and non-vegetarian. Expensive spices such as saffron, cinnamon or cloves were used very sparingly\u2014if at all. Nuts, dry fruits, milk and milk products (such as cream, ghee or curd) were similarly scarce.[10] These economic and social restrictions influenced Bengali widows to create a brand new set of meals that utilized only vegetables and cheap spices. The large-scale displacement along religious lines as a result of the partition led to changes in meal-taking, so as to adhere to religious restrictions. In Bangladesh (former East Bengal and East Pakistan), Mughlai food is common, and includes foods that are less popular in West Bengal, such as beef kebab. Additionally, sweets such as zarda and firni-payesh are eaten. In rural Bangladesh, many people eat makna fried, popped, or raw.[11][12] During the colonial period, many Western food shops were established in Kolkata, making puff pastries, channa, chocolate, and chips especially popular. Dishes such as chop, gravy cutlet, sponge rasogolla, and ledikeni.[11] As a result of a multi-cultural community, Kolkata city's cuisine continuously changes, and takes heavy influence from Chinese and European palates.[12][13] Bengali cuisine can be subdivided into four different types of dishes: eatables (\u0996\u09be\u09a6\u09cd\u09af, \u09ad\u0995\u09cd\u09b7\u09cd\u09af, or \u09ad\u09cb\u099c\u09cd\u09af); \u099a\u09b0\u09cd\u09ac\u09cd\u09af, ch\u00f4rby\u00f4, or chewables, such as rice or fish; \u099a\u09cb\u09b7\u09cd\u09af, choshy\u00f4, or suckables, such as ambal and tak; \u09b2\u09c7\u09b9\u09cd\u09af, lehy\u00f4, or lickables, like chutney; and \u09aa\u09c7\u09af\u09bc, pey\u00f4, or drinkables which includes drinks, mainly milk.[14] Different parts of Bengal are famed for certain dishes, food items and ingredients. For example, South Bengali districts around the Sundarbans boast of the expensive chui jhal chilli, which they peel and chop into small pieces to be cooked in their dishes and give off a strong aroma. On the other hand, North Bengal  are the homes of many Bengali desserts such as the Mishti doi of Bogra, the Kachagolla of Natore and the Chomchom of Porabari. However, other regions also have famous desserts like the Balish Mishti (pillow-sweet) of Netrokona, the Monda of Muktagachha, the Red Yoghurt of Nabadwip and the famed Roshmolai of Comilla. Chittagonian Bengali culinary tradition is mostly known for Mezban and mixed rice dishes like kala bhuna, which has shoulder pieces of beef and traditional spices. Dried fish (shutki) is more available in the Chittagong region than in other parts of Bengal.[15] Mezban (locally known as Mejjan) is the Bengali word for special occasion feasts in the Chittagong region of Bangladesh.[16] Historically Mezbani is a traditional regional feast where people are invited to enjoy a meal with white rice and beef, besides other dishes rich in animal fat and dairy.[17] It is held on the occasions such as death anniversary, birth anniversary, celebrating successes, launching of a new business, entry into a new house, the birth of a child, marriage, aqiqah and circumcision, ear piercing of girls and naming of the newborn.[16][17] The invitation of the Mezban ceremony generally remains open for all and various people to different places and neighbourhoods convey the invitation for the feast. In urban areas, attending a mezban is by invitation only. Usually, the consumption of food at Mezbani takes place from morning to afternoon.[16] Beef-based dishes are preferred by Bengali Muslims and are a symbol of social prestige for a Mezban feast.[17] The rich and the poor arrange feasts on various occasions as much as circumstances allow them. It has a distinct style of cooking and proper Mezban meat demands a certain skill;[17] for example:[16] The unique beef curry served in this feast is known as Mezbani gosht, that carries a distinctive recipe, knowledge of which is essentially confined within the Chittagonian cooks.[18] Fish is used instead of beef while cooking Mezban in Hindu tradition. The Hindu community of Chittagong organises Mezbani each year under the banner of \"Chittagong Parishad\", with curries made from fish, vegetable and dried fish.[16] Dhakaiya food is one of the most notable regional Bengali cuisines. The rich culinary customs are influenced by Mughlai, Central Asian, Armenian, Hindustani and native Bengali cuisines. However, it also has dishes unique to Dhaka.[19] The Nawabs of Dhaka had brought Mughlai cuisine to Bengal, that were wholly retained by Dhaka's culinary community. Due to the high costs of producing Mughlai food, the recipes were limited to the elite classes in colonial India, and slowly expanded as Bangladesh's economy grew. The main focus on lamb, mutton, beef, yoghurt, and mild spices define the taste of the style. Such dishes as kebab; stuffed breads; kacchi biriyani; roast lamb, duck, and chicken; patisapta; Kashmiri tea; and korma are still served at special occasions like Eid and weddings.[12][20] Due to the high class of the food, using an excess amount of expensive ingredients like ghee, and making the food melt in one's mouth were essential to the feel of the food.[21] Old Dhaka boasts a variation of the famous pilaf - the Morog Polao - in which the rice is cooked after and the chicken pieces are cut. Other polaos include ilish polao and rui polao. Dhakaiyas are noted for introducing paneer and boiled eggs to khichuri.[19] Dhakai bakarkhani is a thick, biscuit-like flat-bread which is a traditional street-food snack, famed for its quality and taste. It is mainly dished up with tea.[22][23] Dhakaiyas proudly hold a heritage of creating the best khili paan using various herbs and spices. They also offer a khili paan for diabetic patients called the \"paan afsana\".[24] Haji biryani is a dish, invented by a restaurateur in 1939, made with highly seasoned rice, goat's meat and number of spices and nuts. The restaurant has become an integral part of Dhakaiya culture.[25] In Kolkata, many local street vendors own small shops from which they sell their own homemade goods.[26] Items like cheeses (paneer) can be eaten as is, or can be made into sweet sandesh, rosomalai, rosogolla, or chanar payesh. Milk is especially used in Kolkata's various types of payesh, differing in use of different grains and additives like dates, figs, and berries.[27][28] In addition to European foodstuffs like chocolate, Kolkata takes culinary influence from its Chinese diaspora.[29] Phuchka, known the rest of India as panipuri, is a common kind of Bengali street food made with a fried dough casing and a potato and chickpea filling, usually found in small stalls alongside bhelpuri, masala chai, ghugni and chaat stalls.[30] During the 19th century many Odia cooks migrated to Bengal to work in the households of affluent Kolkata families. They were also hired to cook in weddings and other family ceremonies. Introduction of Odia cooks into their kitchens brought in subtle but significant changes to Kolkata's cuisine. Some of Kolkata's classic dishes were originally from Odisha but were refined in Kolkata kitchens by Odia cooks. In fact some researchers say that dishes like kanika (Bengali mishti pulao) were first introduced to Kolkata kitchens by Odia cooks although this is contested by other researchers.[31][32] Even to this date most of the cooks in Kolkata kitchens and hotels are Odia cooks.[33] The Chinese of Kolkata originally settled into a village called Achipur south of Kolkata in the late 18th century, later moving into the city and finally into its present home in Tangra at the eastern edge of Kolkata.[34] The Chinese-origin people of Kolkata form a substantial and successful community with a distinct identity.[35] With this identity came Chinese food, available at almost every street corner in Kolkata at present, due to the taste, quick cooking procedure, and no similarity with the original Chinese recipe other than the use of soy sauce. They were mostly Cantonese tradesmen and sailors who first settled down here and decided to cook with whatever items they had at hand.[36] Calcuttan immigrants to other countries have started carrying this abroad as well;[35] Indian Chinese restaurants have appeared in many places in the United States and UK.[37] Indian Chinese food has been given a second boost in popularity since the 1950s when a large number of Tibetans migrated into Indian Territory, following the 14th Dalai Lama's flight.[38] Tibetans brought their own taste preferences to add to the genre, such as the popular momo (a kind of dumpling) or thukpa (a hearty noodle soup). Tibetans and Nepali immigrants found ready employment in the many kitchens that can now be found on virtually every street in Kolkata.[39][40] Adda (Bengali: \u0986\u09a1\u09cd\u09a1\u09be) is a traditional Bengali means of socialising over food during the work day. Food taken during adda consists usually of mishti or sweetmeats, tea, and coffee, although heartier meats such as fried fish may be brought out as well. The adda saw a rise during the colonial era among the Bhadralok guild members to meet and talk about a range of topics:[41] \"You could be discussing Charles and Camilla's marriage this moment, and the next moment you're swinging over to the latest cricket series between India and Pakistan, and then swing back to the recent controversy over Tagore.\"[42] Being a hobby for artisans, women were largely secluded from adda, a sentiment that has begun to disappear with the democratization of adda and women occupying a larger space in social life. For this reason, adda was seen as a refuge \"...from the home, a neutral rendezvous away from both the perceived drudgery of the workplace and domesticity\".[41] In the post-colonial era, the adda has been fading due to the more rigid structure of work and exploitative perceptions of unnecessary laziness. This has inspired a sizeable movement of Bengalis who believe it integral to the idea of lyadh, or doing nothing to relax and recharge.[41] However, adda does still exist, being attended during vacation time or after work at clubs or coffee shops. The tradition even has an equivalent to the Greek symposium, as students may meet for a study session over food or have a teacher teach in a more relaxed environment.[43] Sylhet boasts a variation of the famous pilaf dish \u2013 Akhni polao \u2013 in which the rice is cooked after and the chicken pieces are cut. Commonly consumed varieties of meat include beef, chicken, mutton and duck/goose in dishes such as Hash O Bash. They also proudly hold the heritage of Beef Hatkora, a rice dish consisting of a wild citrus fruit not found in other parts of Bengal.[44] During the British period, biscuits and loaves were introduced in Sylhet and received popularity within the Muslim community. The middle-class Hindus of Cachar and Sylhet however were very suspicious of biscuits and breads as they believed they were baked by Muslims. In one occasion, a few Hindus in Cachar caught some Englishman eating biscuits with tea which caused an uproar. The information reached the Hindus of Sylhet and a little rebellion occurred. In response to this, companies started to advertise their bread as \"machine-made\" and \"untouched by (Muslim) hand\" to tell Hindus that the breads were \"safe for consumption\". This incident is mentioned in Bipin Chandra Pal's autobiography and he mentions how gradually culinary habits of Hindus eventually changed.[45] Bengali food is often served on plates which have a distinct flowery pattern often in blue or pink. Another characteristic of Bengali food is the use the boti (also called dao or da). It is a long curved blade on a platform held down by one or both feet; both hands are used to hold whatever is being cut and move it against the blade, which faces the user. This method gives effective control over the cutting process, and can be used to cut anything from prawns to large pumpkins.[46] A korai is a cooking vessel for most Bengali sauces and stir-fry. The dekchi (a flat-bottomed pan) is used generally for larger amounts of cooking or for making rice. It comes with a thin flat lid which is used also to strain out the starch while finishing up cooking rice. The tawa is used to make roti and paratha.[47] The other prominent cooking utensil is a hari, which is a round-bottomed pot-like vessel. The three mentioned vessels all come in various sizes and in various metals and alloys.[48] A flat metal spatula, khunti, is used often, along with hata (scoop with a long handle), jhanjri (round-shaped sieve-like spatula to deep-fry food), the shanrashi (pincers to remove vessels from the fire), the ghuntni (wooden hand blender) for pur\u00e9eing dal, the wooden belun chaki (round pastry board and rolling pin), and the shil nora, which is a rough form of a mortar and pestle or grinding stone. The kuruni is used only to grate coconuts.[49] Silverware is not a part of traditional Bengali cookery.[49] Bengalis usually eat sitting on the floor with food served on a dostorkhan. They historically ate without silverware,[50] with a large banana or plantain leaf serving as the plate, or with plates made from dried sal leaves sewn together. It is customary to offer guests food and drink appropriate to the time of their visit. At meals, guests are served first, with the possible exception of very old or very young members of the host family. Within the family, serving starts with the senior males (those of highest social rank or eldest). School-age children are served before wives, daughter-in-laws, and the cook, who are the last to eat.[50] Prior to colonisation, adherence to meal order was a marker of social status, but with British and Portuguese influence and the growth of the middle class, this has slowly disappeared. Courses are frequently skipped or combined with everyday meals.[43][failed verification] Meals were usually served course by course to the diners by the youngest housewives, but increasing influence of nuclear families and urbanisation has replaced this.[51][self-published source] It is common to place everything on platters in the centre of the table, and each diner serves themselves. Ceremonial occasions such as weddings used to have elaborate serving rituals, but professional catering and buffet-style dining is now commonplace. However, large family occasions and more lavish ceremonial feasts may still abide by these rules.[51][52] Daily meals are usually simple, geared to balance nutrition and making extensive use of vegetables. The courses progress broadly from lighter to richer and heavier and go through various tastes and taste cleansers. Rice remains common throughout the meal and is the main constituent of the meal, until the cha\u0163ni (chutney) course.[53] Fish is a core part of the Bengali diet, and is the main source of protein. Bengalis typically use freshwater and brackish fish when making meals. Spices are used heavily in the preparation of fish, and the fish is usually served either as a curry or a fried steak. Popular fish curries include boal, rohu, ilish, and pabda. One tradition includes the left side of the cidal fish being cooked in oil.[54] Bengali Vaishnavas avoid all types of fish, eggs and meat. Bengali sweets have a long history. The Portuguese friar Sebastien Manrique, travelling in the region in the 17th century, noted the multitude of milk-based foods and sweets prepared in traditional ways.[55] Falooda, shahi jilapi and shemai are popular sweet foods and desserts. Roshogolla, a Bengali traditional sweet, is one of the most widely consumed sweets in India. It spread to Bengal in 1868. Chhana based sweets were introduced in Eastern India from about the 18th century; as the process and technology involved in synthesizing \"Chhana\" was introduced to the Indians by the Dutch in the 1790s. The cottage cheese \"schmierkase\" was also known as Dutch cheese.[56] The earlier versions of Rossogolla lacked binding capacity of the modern avatar that is well known and highly acclaimed today. This was due to the fact that the know-how involved in synthesizing such a sweet was unknown before being experimentally developed by Nobin Chandra Das and then constantly improved and further standardized by his successors. Furthermore, the \"chhana\" manufactured in those days was a coarse and granular variety and had low binding capacity. It was made by citric and ascorbic acid from natural fruit extracts. This type of \"chhana\" cannot be worked on to compact into any regular and firm shape for the purpose of sweet-making, leave alone making Rossogolla. This is because of a documented technological issue \u2013 lactic acid (extracted from whey) used to curdle milk now was introduced to India in the late 18th century by Dutch and Portuguese colonists (along with acetic acid).[57] It is this method that creates the fine, smooth modern \"chhana\" with high binding capacity \u2013 which is now the staple raw material for Bengali confectioners. At present, Nobin Chandra Das is referred to have invented the spongy variant of rossogolla.[58] Laddu (or as it is known as \"darbesh\" in Bengal) is a very common sweet in West Bengal and Bangladesh, as well as the rest of the subcontinent, especially during celebrations and festivities.[59][60] They are usually made out of flour, ghee/butter/oil and sugar. Alternative recipes can be made of coconut shavings and jaggery, raisins, chopped nuts, oatmeal, khoa, nutmeg, cardamom, or poppy seeds, among other ingredients.[61][62][63][64] The sweet dates back to the year 4 BCE, where it was used for medicinal purposes and to keep the hormones of 9-11-year-old girls' hormones \"in check\".[65] Pantua is similar to gulab jamun, and could be called a Bengali variant of that dish.[66] Several varieties of doi such as mish\u0163i doi, fruit-floured doi like aam doi, custards, and rice pudding (khir or firni)[67] are also popular in West Bengal. Sh\u00f4ndesh, chhanar jilapi, kalo jam, raghobshai, \"pantua\", \"jolbhora shondesh\",[68] \"roshbhora\", \"lord chomchom\", payesh, bundiya, nalengurer sh\u00f4ndesh, malpoa, shor bhaja, langcha, babarsa, and a variety of others are examples of sweets in Bengali cuisine. Common beverages include shorbot, lachhi, ghol, matha, falooda and Rooh Afza. The two main types of Bengali tea are dudh cha (milk tea) and masala cha. Srimangal, the tea capital of Bengal, is famed for the Seven Color Tea whilst Dhaka is famed for the borhani. Traditional fruit juices (rosh) are also drunk such as sugarcane juice, mango juice, palm fruit juice, date juice as well as basil seed or tukma-based drinks.", "Masala": "Masala, Massala or MASALA may refer to:", "Coconut Sambol": " Pol sambol (Sinhala: \u0db4\u0ddc\u0dbd\u0dca \u0dc3\u0db8\u0dca\u0db6\u0ddd\u0dbd), or thenkai sambal (Tamil: \u0ba4\u0bc7\u0b99\u0bcd\u0b95\u0bbe\u0baf\u0bcd \u0b9a\u0bae\u0bcd\u0baa\u0bb2\u0bcd), is a traditional Sri Lankan dish made from coconut, mostly used as an accompaniment with rice, string hoppers, hoppers and curries.[1][2]  It is a coconut relish, consisting of freshly grated coconut, shallots, dried whole chilies or chili powder, lime juice, and salt.[3][4] Traditionally the ingredients are ground on a rectangular block of granite with a granite rolling-pin, known as a miris gala (Sinhala: \u0db8\u0dd2\u0dbb\u0dd2\u0dc3\u0dca \u0d9c\u0dbd).[5] Alternatives include the use of Maldives fish (umbalaka\u1e0da), a smoked and cured tuna, that is sold in chips or flakes.[6][7] A variation can be made by saut\u00e9ing the pol sambol in mustard seeds, curry leaves and sliced onion, which is called badapu pol sambol (saut\u00e9ed pol sambol). Room temperature", "Chocolate Cake": " Chocolate cake or chocolate g\u00e2teau (from French: g\u00e2teau au chocolat) is a cake flavored with melted chocolate, cocoa powder, or both. It can also have other ingredients such as fudge, vanilla creme, and other sweeteners.[1] The history of chocolate cake goes back to the 17th century, when cocoa powder from the Americas was added to traditional cake recipes.[2] In 1828, Coenraad van Houten of the Netherlands developed a mechanical method for extracting the fat from cacao liquor, resulting in cacao butter and the partly defatted cacao, a compacted mass of solids that could be sold as \"rock cacao\" or ground into powder.[3] The processes transformed chocolate from an exclusive luxury to an inexpensive daily snack.[3] A process for making silkier and smoother chocolate, called conching, was developed in Switzerland in 1879 by Rodolphe Lindt. This made it easier to bake with chocolate, as it amalgamates smoothly and completely with cake batters.[3] Until the 1890s, chocolate recipes were mostly for chocolate drinks,[3] and its presence in cakes was only in fillings and glazes.[4] In 1886, American cooks began adding chocolate to the cake batter to make the first chocolate cakes in that country.[4] The Duff Company of Pittsburgh, a molasses manufacturer, introduced \"Devil's food\" chocolate cake mixes in the mid-1930s, but production was put on hold during World War II. After the war, the Pilsbury company was in 1948 the first to sell a chocolate cake mix,[5] and in 1951 the \"Three Star Surprise\" mix from Duncan Hines (so called because a white, yellow or chocolate cake could be made from the same mix)[6] swept the market.[5][7] \"Chocolate decadence\" cakes were popular in the United States 1980s. In the 1990s, single-serving molten chocolate cakes with liquid chocolate centers and infused chocolates with exotic flavors such as tea, curry, red pepper, passion fruit, and champagne were popular. Chocolate lounges and artisanal chocolate makers were popular in the 2000s.[8] Rich, all-but-flourless chocolate cakes are \"now standard in the modern p\u00e2tisserie\", according to Maricel Presilla's The New Taste of Chocolate in 2001.[3] Popular variants on chocolate cake include:", "Kitchree": " Khichdi or khichri (Urdu: \u06a9\u06be\u0686\u0691\u06cc, romanized:\u00a0khic\u1e5b\u012b, Hindi: \u0916\u093f\u091a\u0921\u093c\u0940, romanized:\u00a0khic\u1e5b\u012b, pronounced [\u02c8k\u02b0\u026at\u0283\u027di\u02d0], Bengali: \u0996\u09bf\u099a\u09c1\u09a1\u09bc\u09bf, romanized:\u00a0Khicu\u1e5bi, Odia: \u0b16\u0b47\u0b1a\u0b41\u0b21\u0b3f) is a dish in South Asian cuisine made of rice and lentils (dal) with numerous variations. Variations include bajra and mung dal khichri. In Indian culture, in several regions, especially in the northern areas, it is considered one of the first solid foods that babies eat.[1][2][3] The word Khichd\u012b is derived from Sanskrit \u0916\u093f\u091a\u094d\u091a\u093e khicc\u0101,[4][5] a dish of rice and legumes.[6] Some divergence of transliteration may be noted in the third consonant in the word khic\u1e5b\u012b. The sound is the retroflex flap [\u027d], which is written in Hindi with the Devanagari letter \u27e8\u0921\u093c\u27e9, and in Urdu script with the Perso-Arabic letter \u27e8\u0691\u27e9. In Hindustani phonology, the etymological origin of the retroflex flap was /\u0256/ when it occurred between vowels.[7] Hence in Devanagari the letter \u27e8\u0921\u27e9, representing /\u0256/, was adapted to write /\u027d/ by adding a diacritic under it. In Urdu script, the phonological quality of the flap was represented by adapting the letter \u27e8\u0631\u27e9, representing /r/, with a diacritic added above it to indicate the retroflex quality. The occurrence of this consonant in the word khic\u1e5b\u012b has given rise to two alternative spellings in English: khichri, which reflects its phonology, and khichdi, which reflects its etymology. The Greek king Seleucus during his campaign in India (305-303 BC), mentioned that rice with pulses is very popular among people of the Indian subcontinent.[3] Strabo also notes that Indian food mainly consisted of rice porridge and a beverage made of rice, presently called arak.[8] The Moroccan traveller Ibn Battuta mentions khichdi as a dish in India composed of rice and mung beans, during his stay around 1350.[9] khichdi is described in the writings of Afanasiy Nikitin, a Russian adventurer who travelled to the Indian subcontinent in the 15th century. It was very popular with the Mughals, especially Jahangir. Ain-i-Akbari, a 16th-century document written by Mughal Emperor Akbar's vizier, Abu'l Fadl, mentions the recipe for khichdi, which gives seven variations.[10] There is an anecdotal story about khichdi featuring Akbar and his court advisor, Birbal.[11] The Anglo-Indian dish kedgeree is thought to derive from khichri.[12][13] Khichdi is a very popular dish across the Indian subcontinent which consists of, Bangladesh, Pakistan, Nepal and Sri Lanka. The dish is also widely prepared in many Indian states, such as Punjab, Haryana, Rajasthan, Karnataka, Telangana, Madhya Pradesh, Gujarat, Tamil Nadu, Andhra Pradesh, West Bengal, Assam, Bihar, Jharkhand, Uttar Pradesh, Odisha, and Maharashtra.[14] Vegetables such as cauliflower, potato, and green peas are commonly added. Hindus, mainly from north/northwest, who avoid eating grains during fasting, eat Sabudana khichri made from sago.[15][16] In the southern part of India, however, the word khichri is not that popular. While people of Tamil Nadu and Andhra regions cook Pongal, and Kannadigas prepare Huggi which is mung dal khichdi and Bisi bele bhath, a pigeon pea variation with vegetables, Keralites have no similar dish. Khichdi was the inspiration for Anglo-Indian kedgeree[12][17] Khichdi is a popular traditional staple in Haryana, specially in the rural areas. Haryanvi khichdi is made from pearl millet and mung dal (split mung bean) pounded in mortar (unkhal), and often eaten by mixing with warm ghee or lassi, or even yogurt.[18][19][20][21] Sometimes, jowar is also mixed with bajra and mung dal.[21] The Hyderabadi Muslim community, of the erstwhile Hyderabad State, in present-day Telangana, Marathwada, and Kalyana-Karnataka regions, make khichdi as a common breakfast dish, and is an important part of Hyderabadi cuisine.[22] The dish is called khichri, kheema, khatta, or other switch-around versions of the previous, named after the three parts of the meal, Khichri, ground beef, and a sour sauce, made of tamarind and sesame.[23] Khichra is similar to haleem, a meat dish, while khichra is a vegetarian dish with rice and pulses or lentils, with no spices.[24] In 2017, Indian media unofficially designated it as the \"national dish\", as it is being globally promoted by the government of India as \"queen of all foods\". The report that the government may designate khichri as India's \"national dish\" brought significant ridicule from the opposition politicians.[25] However, India's Minister of Food Processing Industries Harsimrat Kaur Badal clarified that while Khichdi is considered nutritious and healthy food in India, the government did not have any plans to designate a national food.[26][27][28] Khichdi has lent its name to media synonymous with ensembles or potpourri as depicted in the popular culture through movies such as Khichdi: The Movie, and TV sitcoms such as Khichdi and Instant Khichdi. The dish has been cooked at both MasterChef Australia[29] and America.[1]", "Shrimp": " A shrimp (pl.: shrimp (US) or shrimps (UK) is a crustacean (a form of shellfish) with an elongated body and a primarily swimming mode of locomotion \u2013 typically belonging to the Caridea or Dendrobranchiata of the order Decapoda, although some crustaceans outside of this order are also referred to as \"shrimp\". More narrow definitions may be restricted to Caridea, to smaller species of either group or to only the marine species. Under a broader definition, shrimp may be synonymous with prawn, covering stalk-eyed swimming crustaceans with long, narrow muscular tails (abdomens), long whiskers (antennae), and slender legs.[1] Any small crustacean which resembles a shrimp tends to be called one.[2] They swim forward by paddling with swimmerets on the underside of their abdomens, although their escape response is typically repeated flicks with the tail driving them backwards very quickly. Crabs and lobsters have strong walking legs, whereas shrimp have thin, fragile legs which they use primarily for perching.[3] Shrimp are widespread and abundant. There are thousands of species adapted to a wide range of habitats. They can be found feeding near the seafloor on most coasts and estuaries, as well as in rivers and lakes. To escape predators, some species flip off the seafloor and dive into the sediment.[3] They usually live from one to seven years.[4] Shrimp are often solitary, though they can form large schools during the spawning season.[3][5] They play important roles in the food chain and are an important food source for larger animals ranging from fish to whales. The muscular tails of many shrimp are edible to humans, and they are widely caught and farmed for human consumption. Commercial shrimp species support an industry worth 50 billion dollars a year,[3] and in 2010 the total commercial production of shrimp was nearly 7 million tonnes. Shrimp farming became more prevalent during the 1980s, particularly in China, and by 2007 the harvest from shrimp farms exceeded the capture of wild shrimp. There are significant issues with excessive bycatch when shrimp are captured in the wild, and with pollution damage done to estuaries when they are used to support shrimp farming. Many shrimp species are small as the term shrimp suggests, about 2\u00a0cm (0.79\u00a0in) long, but some shrimp exceed 25\u00a0cm (9.8\u00a0in). Larger shrimp are more likely to be targeted commercially and are often referred to as prawns, particularly in the Commonwealth of Nations and former British colonies. From Raymond Bauer in Remarkable Shrimps:[6] From the English Oxford Dictionaries: Shrimp are swimming crustaceans with long narrow muscular abdomens and long antennae. Unlike crabs and lobsters, shrimp have well developed pleopods (swimmerets) and slender walking legs; they are more adapted for swimming than walking. Historically, it was the distinction between walking and swimming that formed the primary taxonomic division into the former suborders Natantia and Reptantia. Members of the Natantia (shrimp in the broader sense) were adapted for swimming while the Reptantia (crabs, lobsters, etc.) were adapted for crawling or walking.[9] Some other groups also have common names that include the word \"shrimp\";[10] any small swimming crustacean resembling a shrimp tends to be called one.[3] The following description refers mainly to the external anatomy of the common European shrimp, Crangon crangon, as a typical example of a decapod shrimp. The body of the shrimp is divided into two main parts: the head and thorax which are fused together to form the cephalothorax, and a long narrow abdomen. The shell which protects the cephalothorax is harder and thicker than the shell elsewhere on the shrimp and is called the carapace. The carapace typically surrounds the gills, through which water is pumped by the action of the mouthparts.[16] The rostrum, eyes, whiskers and legs also issue from the carapace. The rostrum, from the Latin r\u014dstrum meaning beak, looks like a beak or pointed nose at the front of the shrimp's head. It is a rigid forward extension of the carapace and can be used for attack or defense. It may also stabilize the shrimp when it swims backward. Two bulbous eyes on stalks sit either side of the rostrum. These are compound eyes which have panoramic vision and are very good at detecting movement. Two pairs of whiskers (antennae) also issue from the head. One of these pairs is very long and can be twice the length of the shrimp, while the other pair is quite short. The antennae have sensors on them which allow the shrimp to feel where they touch, and also allow them to \"smell\" or \"taste\" things by sampling the chemicals in the water. The long antennae help the shrimp orient itself with regard to its immediate surroundings, while the short antennae help assess the suitability of prey.[3][10] Eight pairs of appendages issue from the cephalothorax. The first three pairs, the maxillipeds, Latin for \"jaw feet\", are used as mouthparts. In Crangon crangon, the first pair, the maxillula, pumps water into the gill cavity. After the maxilliped come five more pairs of appendages, the pereiopods. These form the ten decapod legs. In Crangon crangon, the first two pairs of pereiopods have claws or chela. The chela can grasp food items and bring them to the mouth. They can also be used for fighting and grooming. The remaining four legs are long and slender, and are used for walking or perching.[3][10][12][17] The muscular abdomen has six segments and has a thinner shell than the carapace. Each segment has a separate overlapping shell, which can be transparent. The first five segments each have a pair of appendages on the underside, which are shaped like paddles and are used for swimming forward. The appendages are called pleopods or swimmerets, and can be used for purposes other than swimming. Some shrimp species use them for brooding eggs, others have gills on them for breathing, and the males in some species use the first pair or two for insemination. The sixth segment terminates in the telson flanked by two pairs of appendages called the uropods. The uropods allow the shrimp to swim backward, and function like rudders, steering the shrimp when it swims forward. Together, the telson and uropods form a splayed tail fan. If a shrimp is alarmed, it can flex its tail fan in a rapid movement. This results in a backward dart called the caridoid escape reaction (lobstering).[3][10][12] Shrimp are widespread, and can be found near the seafloor of most coasts and estuaries, as well as in rivers and lakes. There are numerous species, and usually there is a species adapted to any particular habitat.[3] Most shrimp species are marine, although about a quarter of the described species are found in fresh water.[18] Marine species are found at depths of up to 5,000 metres (16,000\u00a0ft),[16] and from the tropics to the polar regions. Although shrimp are almost entirely fully aquatic, the two species of Merguia are semi-terrestrial and spend a significant part of their life on land in mangrove.[19][20] There are many variations in the ways different types of shrimp look and behave. Even within the core group of caridean shrimp, the small delicate Pederson's shrimp (above) looks and behaves quite unlike the large commercial pink shrimp or the snapping pistol shrimp.[12] The caridean family of pistol shrimp are characterized by big asymmetrical claws, the larger of which can produce a loud snapping sound. The family is diverse and worldwide in distribution, consisting of about 600 species.[22] Colonies of snapping shrimp are a major source of noise in the ocean and can interfere with sonar and underwater communication.[23][24][25] The small emperor shrimp has a symbiotic relationship with sea slugs and sea cucumbers, and may help keep them clear of ectoparasites.[26] Most shrimp are omnivorous, but some are specialised for particular modes of feeding. Some are filter feeders, using their setose (bristly) legs as a sieve; some scrape algae from rocks. Cleaner shrimp feed on the parasites and necrotic tissue of the reef fish they groom.[16] Some species of shrimp are known to cannibalize others as well if other food sources are not readily available. In turn, shrimp are eaten by various animals, particularly fish and seabirds, and frequently host bopyrid parasites.[16] Females of the freshwater shrimp Caridina ensifera are capable of storing sperm from multiple partners, and thus can produce progeny with different paternities.[27]  Reproductive success of sires was found to correlate inversely with their genetic relatedness to the mother.[27]  This finding suggests that sperm competition and/or pre- and post-copulatory female choice occurs.  Female choice may increase the fitness of progeny by reducing inbreeding depression that ordinarily results from the expression of homozygous deleterious recessive mutations.[28] There is little agreement among taxonomists concerning the phylogeny of crustaceans.[29] Within the decapods, \"every study gives totally different results. Nor do even one of these studies match any of the rival morphology studies\".[30] Some taxonomists identify shrimp with the infraorder Caridea and prawns with the suborder Dendrobranchiata.[31] While different experts give different answers, there is no disagreement that the caridean species are shrimp.[3] There are over 3000 caridean species.[32] Occasionally they are referred to as \"true shrimp\".[33] Traditionally, decapods were divided into two suborders: the Natantia (or swimmers) and the Reptantia (or walkers). The Natantia or swimmers included the shrimp. They were defined by their abdomen which, together with its appendages was well adapted for swimming. The Reptantia or walkers included the crabs and lobsters. These species have small abdominal appendages, but robust legs well adapted for walking. The Natantia was thought to be paraphyletic; that is, it was thought that originally all decapods were like shrimp.[34] However, classifications are now based on clades, and the paraphyletic suborder Natantia has been discontinued. \"On this basis, taxonomic classifications now divide the order Decapoda into the two suborders: Dendrobranchiata for the largest shrimp clade, and Pleocyemata for all other decapods. The Pleocyemata are in turn divided into half a dozen infra-orders\"[34] A particularly significant family in this suborder is the Penaeidae, often referred to as penaeid shrimp or penaeid prawn. Most commercially important species are in this family. See below. Other decapod crustaceans also called shrimp, are the ghost or mud shrimp belonging to the infra-order Thalassinidea. In Australia they are called yabbies.[42] The monophyly of the group is not certain; recent studies have suggested dividing the group into two infraorders, Gebiidea and Axiidea.[35] A shrimp seems to be almost any crustacean that isn't a lobster, barnacle, or crab \u2013 Greg Jensen [3] A wide variety of non-decapod crustaceans are also commonly referred to as shrimp. This includes the brine shrimp, clam shrimp, fairy shrimp and tadpole shrimp belonging to the branchiopods, the lophogastridan shrimp, opossum shrimp and skeleton shrimp belonging the Malacostraca; and seed shrimp which are ostracods.[3] Many of these species look quite unlike the commercial decapod shrimp that are eaten as seafood. For example, skeleton shrimp have short legs and a slender tail like a scorpion tail, fairy shrimp swim upside down with swimming appendages that look like leaves, and the tiny seed shrimp have bivalved carapaces which they can open or close.[12] Krill resemble miniature shrimp, and are sometimes called \"krill shrimp\".[43][44] Some mantis shrimp are a foot long, and have bulging eyes, a flattened tail and formidable claws equipped with clubs or sharp spikes, which it can use to knock out its opponents.[12][54] In 1991, archeologists suggested that ancient raised paved areas near the coast in Chiapas, Mexico, were platforms used for drying shrimp in the sun, and that adjacent clay hearths were used to dry the shrimp when there was no sun.[60][61] The evidence was circumstantial, because the chitinous shells of shrimp are so thin they degrade rapidly, leaving no fossil remains. In 1985 Quitmyer and others found direct evidence dating back to 600 AD for shrimping off the southeastern coast of North America, by successfully identifying shrimp from the archaeological remains of their mandibles (jaws).[62][63][64] Clay vessels with shrimp decorations have been found in the ruins of Pompeii.[64] In the 3rd century AD, the Greek author Athenaeus wrote in his literary work, Deipnosophistae; \"... of all fish the daintiest is a young shrimp in fig leaves.\"[65] In North America, indigenous peoples of the Americas captured shrimp and other crustaceans in fishing weirs and traps made from branches and Spanish moss, or used nets woven with fibre beaten from plants. At the same time early European settlers, oblivious to the \"protein-rich coasts\" all about them, starved from lack of protein.[64] In 1735 beach seines were imported from France, and Cajun fishermen in Louisiana started catching white shrimp and drying them in the sun, as they still do today.[64] In the mid nineteenth century, Chinese immigrants arrived for the California Gold Rush, many from the Pearl River Delta where netting small shrimp had been a tradition for centuries. Some immigrants starting catching shrimp local to San Francisco Bay, particularly the small inch long Crangon franciscorum. These shrimp burrow into the sand to hide, and can be present in high numbers without appearing to be so. The catch was dried in the sun and was exported to China or sold to the Chinese community in the United States.[64] This was the beginning of the American shrimping industry. Overfishing and pollution from gold mine tailings resulted in the decline of the fishery. It was replaced by a penaeid white shrimp fishery on the South Atlantic and Gulf coasts. These shrimp were so abundant that beaches were piled with windrows from their moults. Modern industrial shrimping methods originated in this area.[64] \"\"For shrimp to develop into one of the world's most popular foods, it took the simultaneous development of the otter trawl... and the internal combustion engine.\"[64] Shrimp trawling can capture shrimp in huge volumes by dragging a net along the seafloor. Trawling was first recorded in England in 1376, when King Edward III received a request that he ban this new and destructive way of fishing.[66] In 1583, the Dutch banned shrimp trawling in estuaries.[67] In the 1920s, diesel engines were adapted for use in shrimp boats. Power winches were connected to the engines, and only small crews were needed to rapidly lift heavy nets on board and empty them. Shrimp boats became larger, faster, and more capable. New fishing grounds could be explored, trawls could be deployed in deeper offshore waters, and shrimp could be tracked and caught round the year, instead of seasonally as in earlier times. Larger boats trawled offshore and smaller boats worked bays and estuaries. By the 1960s, steel and fibreglass hulls further strengthened shrimp boats, so they could trawl heavier nets, and steady advances in electronics, radar, sonar, and GPS resulted in more sophisticated and capable shrimp fleets.[64] As shrimp fishing methods industrialised, parallel changes were happening in the way shrimp were processed. \"In the 19th century, sun dried shrimp were largely replaced by canneries. In the 20th century, the canneries were replaced with freezers.\"[64] In the 1970s, significant shrimp farming was initiated, particularly in China. The farming accelerated during the 1980s as the quantity of shrimp demand exceeded the quantity supplied, and as excessive bycatch and threats to endangered sea turtles became associated with trawling for wild shrimp.[64] In 2007, the production of farmed shrimp exceeded the capture of wild shrimp.[59] Although there are thousands of species of shrimp worldwide, only about 20 of these species are commercially significant. The following table contains the principal commercial shrimp, the seven most harvested species. All of them are decapods; most of them belong to the Dendrobranchiata and four of them are penaeid shrimp. Commercial techniques for catching wild shrimp include otter trawls, seines and shrimp baiting. A system of nets is used when trawling. Baited traps are common in parts of the Pacific Northwest. Shrimp trawling can result in very high incidental catch rates of non-target species. In 1997, the FAO found discard rates up to 20 pounds for every pound of shrimp. The world average was 5.7 pounds for every pound of shrimp.[92] Trawl nets in general, and shrimp trawls in particular, have been identified as sources of mortality for species of finfish and cetaceans.[93] Bycatch is often discarded dead or dying by the time it is returned to the sea, and may alter the ecological balance in discarded regions.[94] Worldwide, shrimp trawl fisheries generate about 2% of the world's catch of fish in weight, but result in more than one third of the global bycatch total. The most extensively fished species are the akiami paste shrimp, the northern prawn, the southern rough shrimp, and the giant tiger prawn. Together these four species account for nearly half of the total wild capture. In recent years, the global capture of wild shrimp has been overtaken by the harvest from farmed shrimp.[59] A shrimp farm is an aquaculture business for the cultivation of marine shrimp or prawns for human consumption. Commercial shrimp farming began in the 1970s, and production grew steeply, particularly to match the market demands of the United States, Japan and Western Europe. The total global production of farmed shrimp reached more than 1.6 million tonnes in 2003, representing a value of nearly 9 billion U.S. dollars. About 75% of farmed shrimp are produced in Asia, in particular in China, Thailand, Indonesia, India and Vietnam. The other 25% are produced mainly in Latin America, where Brazil is the largest producer. By 2016, the largest exporting nation is India, followed by Ecuador, Thailand, Indonesia and China.[95] As can be seen from the global production chart on the left, significant aquaculture production started slowly in the 1970s and then rapidly expanded during the 1980s. After a lull in growth during the 1990s, due to pathogens, production took off again and by 2007 exceeded the capture from wild fisheries. By 2010, the aquaculture harvest was 3.9 million tonnes, compared to 3.1 million tonnes for the capture of wild shrimp.[59] In the earlier years of marine shrimp farming the preferred species was the large giant tiger prawn. This species is reared in circular holding tanks where they think they are in the open ocean, and swim in \"never ending migration\" around the circumference of the tank.[96] In 2000, global production was 630,984 tonnes, compared to only 146,362 tonnes for whiteleg shrimp. Subsequently, these positions reversed, and by 2010 the production of giant tiger prawn increased modestly to 781,581 tonnes while whiteleg shrimp rocketed nearly twenty-fold to 2,720,929 tonnes.[59] The whiteleg shrimp is currently the dominant species in shrimp farming. It is a moderately large shrimp reaching a total length of 230\u00a0mm (9\"), and is particularly suited to farming because it \"breeds well in captivity, can be stocked at small sizes, grows fast and at uniform rates, has comparatively low protein requirements... and adapts well to variable environmental conditions.\"[97] In China, prawns are cultured along with sea cucumbers and some fish species, in integrated multi-trophic systems. The major producer of farmed shrimp is China. Other significant producers are Thailand, Indonesia, India, Vietnam, Brazil, Ecuador and Bangladesh. Most farmed shrimp is exported to the United States, the European Union and Japan,[98] also other Asian markets, including South Korea, Hong Kong, Taiwan and Singapore.[95] Investigations by The Guardian in 2014 and The Associated Press in 2015 found human rights abuses on fishing boats operated by Thailand. The boats are manned with slaves, and catch shrimp and fish (including fish for the production of fishmeal which is fed to farmed prawns).[99][100] Greenpeace has challenged the sustainability of tropical shrimp farming practices on the grounds that farming these species \"has led to the destruction of vast areas of mangroves in several countries [and] over-fishing of juvenile shrimp from the wild to supply farms.\" Greenpeace has placed a number of the prominent tropical shrimp species that are farmed commercially on its seafood red list, including the whiteleg shrimp, Indian prawn and giant tiger shrimp.[101] Shrimp are marketed and commercialized with several issues in mind. Most shrimp are sold frozen and marketed based on their categorization of presentation, grading, colour, and uniformity.[102] Shrimp have high levels of omega-3 fatty acids and low levels of mercury.[103] Usually shrimp is sold whole, though sometimes only the meat of shrimp is marketed. As with other seafood, shrimp is high in calcium, iodine and protein but low in food energy. A shrimp-based meal is also a significant source of cholesterol, from 122\u00a0mg to 251\u00a0mg per 100\u00a0g of shrimp, depending on the method of preparation.[104] Shrimp consumption, however, is considered healthy for the circulatory system because the lack of significant levels of saturated fat in shrimp means that the high cholesterol content in shrimp improves the ratio of LDL to HDL cholesterol and lowers triglycerides.[105] Ebiko - shrimp roe, sometimes translated as \"shrimp flakes\" - is used as one of the ingredients in the preparation of sushi.[106] Shrimp and other shellfish are among the most common food allergens.[107] They are not kosher and thus are forbidden in Jewish cuisine. Several types of shrimp are kept in home aquaria. Some are purely ornamental, while others are useful in controlling algae and removing debris.[108] Freshwater shrimp commonly available for aquaria include the Bamboo shrimp, Japanese marsh shrimp (Caridina multidentata, also called \"Amano shrimp,\" as their use in aquaria was pioneered by Takashi Amano), cherry shrimp (Neocaridina heteropoda), and ghost or glass shrimp (Palaemonetes spp.). Popular saltwater shrimp include the cleaner shrimp Lysmata amboinensis, the fire shrimp (Lysmata debelius) and the harlequin shrimp (Hymenocera picta). The terms shrimp and prawn are common names, not scientific names. They are vernacular or colloquial terms, which lack the formal definition of scientific terms. They are not taxa, but are terms of convenience with little circumscriptional significance. There is no reason to avoid using the terms shrimp or prawn when convenient, but it is important not to confuse them with the names or relationships of actual taxa.[12] According to the crustacean taxonomist Tin-Yam Chan, \"The terms shrimp and prawn have no definite reference to any known taxonomic groups. Although the term shrimp is sometimes applied to smaller species, while prawn is more often used for larger forms, there is no clear distinction between both terms and their usage is often confused or even reverse in different countries or regions.\"[109] Writing in 1980, L. B. Holthuis noted that the terms prawn and shrimp were used inconsistently \"even within a single region\", generalising that larger species fished commercially were generally called shrimp in the United States, and prawns in other English-speaking countries, although not without exceptions.[110] A lot of confusion surrounds the scope of the term shrimp. Part of the confusion originates with the association of smallness. That creates problems with shrimp-like species that are not small. The expression \"jumbo shrimp\" can be viewed as an oxymoron, a problem that does not exist with the commercial designation \"jumbo prawns\".[111] The term shrimp originated around the 14th century with the Middle English shrimpe, akin to the Middle Low German schrempen, and meaning to contract or wrinkle; and the Old Norse skorpna, meaning to shrivel up, or skreppa, meaning a thin person.[112][113] It is not clear where the term prawn originated, but early forms of the word surfaced in England in the early 15th century as prayne, praine and prane.[114][115][116] According to the linguist Anatoly Liberman it is unclear how shrimp, in English, came to be associated with small. \"No Germanic language associates the shrimp with its size... The same holds for Romance... it remains unclear in what circumstances the name was applied to the crustacean.\"[117] Taxonomic studies in Europe on shrimp and prawns were shaped by the common shrimp and the common prawn, both found in huge numbers along the European coastlines. The common shrimp, Crangon crangon, was categorised in 1758 by Carl Linnaeus, and the common prawn, Palaemon serratus, was categorised in 1777 by Thomas Pennant. The common shrimp is a small burrowing species aligned with the notion of a shrimp as being something small, whereas the common prawn is much larger. The terms true shrimp or true prawn are sometimes used to mean what a particular person thinks is a shrimp or prawn.[12] This varies with the person using the terms. But such terms are not normally used in the scientific literature, because the terms shrimp and prawn themselves lack scientific standing. Over the years the way shrimp and prawn are used has changed, and nowadays the terms are almost interchangeable. Although from time to time some biologists declare that certain common names should be confined to specific taxa, the popular use of these names seems to continue unchanged.[12][118] Only 57 exclusively fossil species are known in the shrimp fossil record.[35] The earliest dates from the Lower Jurassic, followed by specimens from the Cretaceous.[119]", "Dalcha": " Dalcha, is an Indian lentil-based stew originating from Hyderabad, Telangana, India. Its origins may lie with a similar middle eastern dish Harees which is more of a gruel with cooked meats. Primary ingredients are lentils, can be chana dal or sometimes tur dal. Vegetables or meats, both chicken or mutton may also be added to the stew, so if mutton is added it will be called a mutton dalcha. Bottle gourd is another key ingredient in a Dalcha. It is traditionally served with the rice dish called bagara khana. Being of Indian origin, Dalcha is commonly served at Malay weddings in Malaysia and Singapore.[1][2]  This Indian cuisine\u2013related article is a stub.

It is often eaten by itself or as an accompaniment to another dish. Fried rice is a popular component of East Asian, Southeast Asian and certain South Asian cuisines, as well as a staple national dish of Indonesia. As a homemade dish, fried rice is typically made with ingredients left over from other dishes, leading to countless variations. Fried rice first developed during the Sui dynasty in China.[1] Many varieties of fried rice have their own specific list of ingredients. In China, common varieties include Yangzhou fried rice and Hokkien fried rice. Japanese ch\u0101han is considered a Japanese Chinese dish, having derived from Chinese fried rice dishes. In Southeast Asia, similarly constructed Indonesian, Malaysian, and Singaporean nasi goreng and Thai khao phat are popular dishes. In the West, most restaurants catering to vegetarians have invented their own varieties of fried rice, including egg fried rice. Fried rice is also seen on the menus of non-Asian countries restaurants offering cuisines with no native tradition of the dish. Additionally, the cuisine of some Latin American countries includes variations on fried rice, including Ecuadorian chaulafan, Peruvian arroz chaufa, Cuban arroz frito, and Puerto Rican arroz mamposteao. Fried rice is a common street food in Asia and other parts of the world. In some Asian countries, small restaurants, street vendors and traveling hawkers specialise in serving fried rice. In Indonesian cities it is common to find fried rice street vendors moving through the streets with their food cart and stationing it in busy streets or residential areas. Many Southeast Asian street food stands offer fried rice with a selection of optional garnishes and side dishes. Cooked rice is the primary ingredient, with myriad additional ingredients, such as vegetables, eggs, meat (chicken, beef, pork, lamb, mutton), preserved meat (bacon, ham, sausage), seafood (fish, shrimp, crab), mushrooms, among others. Aromatics such as onions, shallots, scallions, leeks, and garlic are often added for extra flavor. Various cooking oils, such as vegetable oil, sesame oil, clarified butter, or lard can be used to grease the wok or frying pan to prevent sticking, as well as for flavor. Fried rice dishes can be seasoned with salt, different types of soy sauce, oyster sauce, teriyaki sauce and many other sauces and spices. Popular garnishes include chopped scallions, sliced chili, fried shallots, sprigs of parsley or coriander leaves, toasted sesame seeds, seaweed flakes (gim or nori), sliced cucumber, tomato, lime, or pickled vegetables. Typically, leftover rice that has been chilled is used rather than freshly cooked rice, as the high moisture content of fresh rice can prevent it from frying properly, leading to an undesirably soft texture. The earliest record of fried rice is in the Sui dynasty (589\u2013618 AD) in China.[2] Fried rice (Thai: \u0e02\u0e49\u0e32\u0e27\u0e1c\u0e31\u0e14, RTGS:\u00a0khao phat, pronounced [k\u02b0\u00e2(\u02d0)w p\u02b0\u00e0t]) in Thailand is typical of central Thai cuisine. In Thai, khao means \"rice\" and phat means \"of or relating to being stir-fried\". This dish differs from Chinese fried rice in that it is prepared with Thai jasmine rice instead of regular long-grain rice. It normally contains meat (chicken, shrimp, pork, and crab are all common), egg, onions, garlic and sometimes tomatoes. The seasonings, which may include soy sauce, sugar, salt, possibly some chili sauce, and the ubiquitous nam pla (fish sauce), are stir-fried together with the other ingredients. The dish is then plated and served with accompaniments like cucumber slices, tomato slices, lime, sprigs of green onion and coriander, and prik nam pla, a spicy sauce made of Thai chili, fish sauce, and chopped garlic. Arroz frito is a denomination used in the Spanish speaking world, meaning \"fried rice\", with adjectives describing the Chinese-inspired varieties, e.g. arroz chino, arroz canton\u00e9s, or local specialties arroz chaufa/chaulaf\u00e1n/chauf\u00e1n/chof\u00e1n, arroz frito tres delicias. An estimated 30,000 people of Chinese origin live in the Dominican Republic. Migration from China began in the second half of the 19th century. Fried rice alongside fried chicken (chicarr\u00f3n de pollo) has been the biggest influence. Dominican fried rice is known as chof\u00e1n. The dish is made with leftover white rice, celery, peppers, onions, carrots, peas, soy sauce and ham, chicken, eggs or shrimp saut\u00e9ed in vegetable oil. Ghanaian fried rice is one of the more contemporary dishes and can be found in almost every Ghanaian restaurant. It is usually made with Jasmine rice, long grain, or basmati rice. The rice is stir-fried with vegetables(carrots, spring onions, peas, green and red bell peppers), eggs, meats of choice(chicken, beef, shrimp), and spices like chili, curry powder, and salt. The sauces mixed with Ghanaian fried rice are usually soy sauce and chicken broth. Nigerian fried rice is made with long-grain rice, diced fried cow liver (optional) or shrimp, protein ( chicken, pork, or shrimp), vegetables (such as carrots, peas, green beans, onions, and chillies), herbs and spices (such as thyme, pepper, and curry powder), and so on. This dish was created by the Yoruba people and spread as a Nigerian staple. Tanzania fried rice is made with long-grain rice, protein (such as beef liver, chicken, or shrimp), vegetables (such as carrots, peas, green beans, onions, and chillies), herbs and spices (such as thyme, pepper, and curry powder), and so on.", "Manicotti": "Manicotti (the plural form of the Italian word manicotto; < manica, 'sleeve', + the augmentative ending, -otto) are a type of pasta in Italian-American cuisine. They are large pasta tubes intended to be stuffed and baked. The filling is generally ricotta cheese mixed with chopped parsley, and possibly ground meat such as veal, but such pasta with a strictly meat filling is called cannelloni rather than manicotti. They are served topped with tomato sauce. Like the cannelloni of Italian cuisine, manicotti can be extruded in tube form, or rolled from sheets of dough. While manicotti are pointed, cannelloni are smooth with flat ends.", "Chicken Masala": " Chicken tikka masala is a dish consisting of roasted marinated chicken chunks (chicken tikka) in a spiced sauce. The sauce is usually creamy and orange-coloured. The dish was created by cooks from South Asia living in Great Britain and is offered at restaurants around the world. Chicken tikka masala is composed of chicken tikka, boneless chunks of chicken marinated in spices and yogurt that are roasted in an oven, served in a creamy sauce.[1][2] A tomato and coriander sauce is common, but no recipe for chicken tikka masala is standard; a survey found that of 48 different recipes, the only common ingredient was chicken.[3][4] The sauce usually includes tomatoes (frequently as pur\u00e9e), cream, coconut cream and a masala spice mix. The sauce and chicken pieces may be coloured orange using foodstuffs such as turmeric, paprika, tomato pur\u00e9e or with food dye. Chicken tikka masala is similar to butter chicken, both in the method of creation and appearance.[5] The origin of the dish is not certain, but many sources attribute it to the South Asian community in Great Britain; some sources cite Glasgow as the city of origin.[2][6][7][8] Chicken tikka masala may derive from butter chicken, a popular dish in the northern Indian subcontinent. The Multicultural Handbook of Food, Nutrition and Dietetics credits its creation to Bangladeshi migrant chefs in Britain in the 1960s. They developed and served a number of new inauthentic \"Indian\" dishes, including chicken tikka masala.[9] Historians of ethnic food Peter and Colleen Grove discuss multiple claims regarding the origin of chicken tikka masala, concluding that the dish \"was most certainly invented in Britain, probably by a Bangladeshi chef.\"[10] They suggest that \"the shape of things to come may have been a recipe for Shahi Chicken Masala in Mrs Balbir Singh\u2019s Indian Cookery published in 1961.\"[10] Another claim is that it originated in a restaurant in Glasgow, Scotland.[11][1] This version recounts how a British Pakistani chef, Ali Ahmed Aslam, proprietor of a restaurant in Glasgow, invented chicken tikka masala by improvising a sauce made from a tin of condensed tomato soup, and spices.[12][13][7] Peter Grove challenged any claim that Aslam was the creator of the dish on grounds that the dish was known to exist several years before his restaurant opened.[14] Chef Anita Jaisinghani, a correspondent in the Houston Chronicle, wrote that \"the most likely story is that the modern version was created during the early \u201970s by an enterprising Indian chef near London\" who used Campbell's tomato soup.[15] However, restaurant owner Iqbal Wahhab claims that he and Peter Grove fabricated the story of a chef using tomato soup to create chicken tikka masala  in order \"to entertain journalists\".[16][17][18] Rahul Verma, a food critic who writes for The Hindu,[19] claimed that the dish has its origins in the Punjab region.[20][11] Chicken tikka masala is served in restaurants around the world.[21][22] According to a 2012 survey of 2,000 people in Britain, it was the country's second-most popular foreign dish to cook, after Chinese stir fry.[23] In 2001, British Foreign Secretary Robin Cook mentioned the dish in a speech acclaiming the benefits of Britain's multiculturalism, declaring: Chicken tikka masala is now a true British national dish, not only because it is the most popular, but because it is a perfect illustration of the way Britain absorbs and adapts external influences. Chicken tikka is an Indian dish. The masala sauce was added to satisfy the desire of British people to have their meat served in gravy.[24][25][16][26] Hot", "Gosht": " Gosht or ghosht refers to tender meat, cooked for a long time, and used as an ingredient in a number of Middle Eastern cuisine, Central Asian cuisine and cuisine of the Indian subcontinent. The word stems from the Persian word gosht \u06af\u0648\u0634\u062a, meaning \"meat\" or \"flesh\", especially that of goat.[1] In India, most gosht dishes include goat or mutton. In India, the term mutton is more likely to refer to the meat of a goat rather than that of an adult sheep, as it does elsewhere in the English-speaking world. When Indian dishes are adapted for Western diners, lamb is the meat most often used in the adaptation. This has led to a common misconception that gosht means \"lamb\".[citation needed] The popular Indian subcontinental dish of Biryani as well as the Afghan dish of Biryan use Gosht as a primary ingredient.[2] Some dishes include:  This Indian cuisine\u2013related article is a stub.

The classic chicken soup consists of a clear chicken broth, often with pieces of chicken or vegetables; common additions are pasta, noodles, dumplings, or carrots, and grains such as rice and barley. Chicken soup is commonly considered a comfort food.[1] Humans were already boiling food by the time that chicken was domesticated in the neolithic period, so it is likely that chickens were being boiled for soup.[2] Modern American chicken soup, which typically includes root vegetables such as carrot, onion, leeks and celery, was a staple across Northern Europe and was brought to the United States by immigrants.[3] Variations on the flavor are gained by adding root vegetables such as parsnip, potato, sweet potato and celery root; herbs such as bay leaves, parsley and dill; other vegetables such as zucchini, whole garlic cloves, lettuce, or tomatoes; and black pepper.[4][5] The soup should be brought slowly to a boil and then simmered in a covered pot on a very low flame for one to three hours, adding water if necessary. Saffron or turmeric are sometimes added as a yellow colorant. Chicken soup can be a relatively low fat food: fat can be removed by chilling the soup after cooking and skimming the layer of congealed fat from the top.[6] A study determined that \"prolonged cooking of a bone in soup increases the calcium content of the soup when cooked at an acidic, but not at a neutral pH\".[7] Strictly speaking, chicken soup, unless qualified, implies that the soup is served as a thin broth, with pieces of meat, and possibly vegetables, and either noodles, rice, barley, or dumplings. Cream of chicken soup is a thick, creamy, soup made with chicken stock and pieces, combined with milk (or cream) and flour, which might contain vegetable pieces, depending on the recipe. Several terms are used when referring to chicken soups: Chicken soup has long been touted as a form of folk medicine to treat respiratory infections.[13] In 2000, scientists at the University of Nebraska Medical Center in Omaha studied the effect of chicken soup on the inflammatory response in vitro. They found that some components of the chicken soup inhibit neutrophil migration, which may have an anti-inflammatory effect that could hypothetically lead to temporary ease from symptoms of illness.[14] However, since these results have been obtained from purified cells (and directly applied), the diluted soup in vivo effect is debatable. The New York Times reviewed the University of Nebraska study, among others, in 2007 and concluded that \"none of the research is conclusive, and it is not known whether the changes measured in the laboratory really have a meaningful effect on people with cold symptoms.\"[15] It has also been shown that chicken soup contains the amino acid cysteine, which is very similar to acetylcysteine, which is used by doctors for patients with bronchitis and other respiratory infections.[16] Chicken soup is also known as \"Jewish penicillin\",[17] either as ersatz penicillin,[18] or as alternative to penicillin.[19] Many Chinese soups are based on chicken broth. Typical Chinese chicken soup is made from old hens and is seasoned with ginger, scallions, black pepper, soy sauce, rice wine and sesame oil.[20] A more elaborate version can be made from freshly killed spent hen and various herbs such as ginseng, dried goji, and old ginger root.[21] The soup is then boiled for hours. Bogot\u00e1, Colombia's capital, is known for a version of chicken soup called ajiaco.[22] Along with chicken, ajiaco typically includes maize, three types of potatoes, avocado, capers, and a herb called guascas, and is served with a dollop of cream. Sancocho de gallina is another popular dish throughout Colombia and in neighboring countries. This is a broth that includes entire pieces of (often rather tough) soup hen on the bone with large pieces of plantain, potato, cassava and/or other vegetables.[23] A bowl of sancocho is usually an entire meal. The Danish h\u00f8nsek\u00f8dssuppe is traditionally cooked using large hens specifically reserved for soup, known as suppeh\u00f8ner (\"soup-hens\"). Vegetables like celeriac, carrots, onions and leek are usually added and typical flavourings are thyme, laurels and white pepper. The soup may be served with small white dumplings and meatballs. As part of traditional housekeeping, the cooked meat is reserved for other dishes such as h\u00f8ns i asparges (\"hens in asparagus\") or h\u00f8nsesalat (\"hens-salad\").[24] The French serve chicken-based forms of bouillon and consomm\u00e9. Typical French seasonings for chicken soup includes: bay leaves, fresh thyme, dry white wine and garlic.[25] In Germany, chicken soup is made with chicken broth, vegetables, such as carrots, spices and herbs and small noodles. For the broth, a large hen, called a Suppenhuhn (lit.: \"soup hen\"), may be boiled, and pieces of it\u2014especially from the boiled breast\u2014can later be added to the soup.[26]\nIn southern Germany, homemade chicken soup typically consists of chicken broth, to which spices and semolina dumplings or noodles are added. Another dish made with chicken broth, pieces of chicken, boiled vegetables, and spices is known as H\u00fchnereintopf,[27] meaning \"chicken stew\". Alternatively, homemade noodles may be added to the chicken broth, without vegetables, and with only pickling spice, salt and pepper added to it. In Ghana, chicken soup, also known as Chicken Light soup is made by cooking the chicken in a blended mixture of tomatoes,  onions,  pepper and other spices and sometimes garden eggs and is served primarily with fufu or on its own.[28] In Greece, chicken soup is most commonly made in the avgolemono (\"egg-lemon\") fashion, wherein beaten eggs mixed with lemon are added to a broth slowly so that the mixture heats up without curdling, also adding rice or pasta like krithar\u00e1ki (\"little barley;\" orzo), resulting in a thicker texture; it is a traditional remedy for colds, stomach aches, and hangovers.[29] Hungarian chicken soup is a clear soup, a consomm\u00e9, called \u00dajh\u00e1zi chicken soup.[30] A consomm\u00e9 with entire pieces of chicken, chicken liver and heart, with chunky vegetables and spices like whole black peppercorn, bay leaves, salt and ground black pepper. The vegetables boiled along with the pieces of chicken are usually carrots, celeriac, parsley root[31] and parsnip. Soup vermicelli, semolina dumplings or thin Sp\u00e4tzle noodles or small dumplings are also added to the soup. Even other vegetables may be used, such as green peas, a whole tomato and whole onions boiled along with the soup, mushrooms, asparagus, celery, green pepper, cauliflower, kohlrabi, green beans or parsley, in different combinations. In Indonesia, chicken soup might appear as sayur sop, vegetable and chicken broth soup that contains chicken pieces, potato, green beans, carrot, celery, and fried shallot.[32] Another chicken soup variant commonly found across the country is soto ayam;[33] a turmeric yellow spicy chicken soup with vegetables and noodle or vermicelli, served with steamed rice, pieces of lontong or ketupat.[34] In Italy, chicken soup is often served with pasta, in such dishes as cappelletti in brodo, tortellini in brodo and passatelli.[35] Even when served on its own, the meat and any vegetables used are usually removed from the broth and served as a second dish.[36] In Japan, chicken soup is known as torijiru.[37]  Typically it starts with dashi, which is made from boiling konbu (kelp) and katsuobushi (dried skipjack tuna flakes), and not by boiling the chicken (whole chicken is not typically available in Japanese supermarkets)[citation needed]. After the dashi is prepared, pieces of boneless chicken thigh meat are usually used and combined with vegetables like daikon radish, carrot, burdock, konnyaku, welsh onion, mushrooms, potatoes, and taro root. At the end, different seasonings are added depending on the region of the country or type of soup. It could be a miso-based soup or soy sauce-based. Cooking sake, mirin, salt, and vinegar are also used with the soy sauce or miso. The pork equivalent called butajiru is more popular than the chicken-based soup.[38] Bone stocks for ramen are also often made with chicken stock, and it is almost invariably used in the less common kotteri variety.[39] Chicken soup is a traditional dish of the European Jewish kitchen. The Russian and Polish Jewish communities use a relatively high proportion of chicken stock for their soup, made mostly from the bones.\nThe soup is prepared with herbs like parsley and fresh dill or thyme, and is often served with knaidlach (matzah balls),[40] kreplach (dumplings), lokshen (flat egg noodles), or mandlen (Shkedei Marak in Israel) (soup \"almonds\"). A traditional garnish was eyerlekh (little eggs). These unlaid chicken eggs were taken from a hen and boiled in the soup.[41][42] Modern health standards make these difficult to obtain now. Samgyetang is a Korean chicken soup with insam (Korean ginseng), daechu (dried jujube fruits), garlic, ginger, glutinous rice, and sometimes other medicinal herbs.[43] It is believed to be not only a cure for physical ailments but also a preventer of sickness.[44] Dak baeksuk, a type of chicken broth with garlic, is also popular among Koreans.[45] It is believed by some to help cure minor illnesses such as the common cold. Some types of baeksuk also contains noodles, similar to chicken noodle soup. Caldo de pollo, also known as Consome de Pollo, is a common Latin-American soup made with whole chicken pieces instead of chopped or shredded chicken, and large cuts of vegetables, such as half-slices of potatoes and whole leaves of cabbage.[46] Another variation of chicken soup is caldo tlalpe\u00f1o which is garnished with chopped avocado, white cheese, and a chipotle chile.[47] Aguadito de pollo is a traditional chicken soup in Peruvian cuisine consisting of chicken, cilantro, vegetables and spices.[48] Caldo de Gallina (lit., \"broth of hen\"), the Peruvian form of chicken soup, is made with whole pieces of chicken instead of chopped or shredded chicken, along with potatoes, egg noodles, and hard-boiled eggs. Lime wedges and chili or aji pepper paste are added as condiments.[49] Chicken soup in the Philippines is called sopas and has some western influences in it. While there are many variations in the recipe, it usually contains chicken strips in broth, onions, vegetables (mainly carrots, cabbage and celery), and macaroni noodles. It is cooked with evaporated milk to give it richer flavor. Sopas is normally associated with the cold, rainy season in the Philippines, and may thus be regarded as local comfort food.[50][51] Another chicken soup is called mami which its style derives from its other Asian neighboring countries, especially East Asia and normally served with sliced chicken, broth, noodles, chopped vegetables. Mami is also associated with the cold, rainy season as well.[52] Other chicken dishes are considered soups. Tinola has chicken cuts in broth, with ginger, chayote, and chili pepper leaves. Sinampalukang manok is sometimes regarded as a chicken version of sinigang, but here the meat is browned first before being boiled in the water and it uses tamarind leaves.[53] Kadyos, manok, kag ubad from the Western Visayas uses pigeon peas and banana pith.[54] The Polish chicken soup is called ros\u00f3\u0142. It is commonly served with fine noodles, boiled carrots and parsley every Sunday.[55] The broth is served separate from chicken meat. There are many types of ros\u00f3\u0142, as: Ros\u00f3\u0142 Kr\u00f3lewski[55] (royal ros\u00f3\u0142), made of three meats: beef or veal, white poultry (hen, turkey or chicken) and dark poultry as duck, goose (crop only), just a couple of dried king boletes, one single cabbage leaf and a variety of vegetables such as parsley, celery, carrot, and leek. The cooking must take at least six hours of sensitive boiling over a small fire.[55] At the end, softly burnt onion is added to the soup. Ros\u00f3\u0142 my\u015bliwski (The hunter's ros\u00f3\u0142) is made of a variety of wild birds[55] as well as pheasant, capercaillie, wood grouse, black grouse, or grey partridge, with a small addition of roe deer meat, a couple of wild mushrooms, and 2\u20133 juniper fruits. Chicken soup is known as canja, a chicken broth prepared with rice or pasta and shredded chicken meat.[56] It is believed to help a person overcome colds and digestive problems, among other mild forms of sickness.[57] In most regions of Romania, chicken soup known as sup\u0103 de pui consists of a clear or dense sour soup with strained chicken and vegetable broth, and either noodles (t\u0103ie\u021bei) or dumplings (g\u0103lu\u0219te) are added.[58] Different versions use pieces of chicken and pieces of boiled vegetables (like onion, carrot, parsnip, celery, zucchini, peas, beans, leaves and root of parsley or peppers) and are seasoned usually with sour cream (sm\u00e2nt\u00e2n\u0103), tomato juice, lemon juice, or bor\u0219.[58] In Taiwan-style chicken soup, dried jujube fruits, dried shiitake, and other various herbs are also sometimes added. While it may be possible to use regular ginseng in the recipe, a special type of ginseng called San qi is commonly used.[59] This is grown almost exclusively in Wenshan County, Yunnan Province. The roots are powdered for ease of use, although it may also be possible to use the flowerheads.[60] East Slavs traditionally prefer an often simple chicken and vegetable bouillon with added noodles or rice, and a pinch of fresh herbs.[61] Another type of chicken soup includes chicken, noodles, carrot, potato and onion.[61] Some cooks add chopped boiled egg and even sour cream to their variations of the soup. Traditionally, chicken soup (or broth) in Britain is a clear and watery soup with chunky vegetables (such as carrot, celery and onion), chicken, salt and pepper. However, a thick, creamy variety called cream of chicken soup,[62] which may not contain any vegetable pieces (depending on the recipe), is more popular today. A distinct version from Scotland that has become popular throughout the UK is cock-a-leekie soup, a clear, thin broth of shredded chicken and leeks.[63] In the United States and Canada, chicken soup often has noodles or rice in it, thus giving it its common name of \"chicken noodle soup\".[64] The term may have been coined in a commercial for the Campbell Soup Company in the 1930s. The original 21 varieties of Campbell's condensed soup featured a \"chicken soup with noodles\", but when it was advertised on the Amos 'n' Andy radio show in the 1930s by a slip of the tongue the soup was referred to as \"chicken noodle soup\".[9] Traditionally, American chicken soup was prepared using old hens too tough and stringy to be roasted or cooked for a short time. In modern times, these fowl are difficult to come by, and broiler chickens (young chickens suitable for roasting or broiling) are often used to make soup.[9] Often (but not always) sold as a condensed soup, canned chicken soup such as Campbell's Chicken Noodle Soup, is notable for its high sodium content:[65] 890\u00a0mg per 1\u20442 cup serving. This gives a 1+1\u20442 cup bowl of soup[66] about 2,500\u00a0mg of sodium, a full day's allowance in the case of this mainstream brand.[67] Other condensed chicken soups produced by Campbell's, such as Chicken with Rice[68] or Chicken & Stars Soup,[69] have similar amounts, as do generic versions of the product.[70] Canned chicken soup with much less sodium than the traditional formulation is available, including many varieties produced by Campbell's, some with as little as 100\u00a0mg of sodium.[65] Campbell's claims production of a chicken noodle soup that will find broad consumer acceptance\u2014in short, that will sell\u2014is very difficult, so it has to balance healthfulness with sodium content.[71] Usually, the main ingredients of this canned soup are:[4][5] Hot", "Mutton Biryani": " Biryani (/b\u025c\u02d0r\u02c8j\u0251\u02d0ni/) is a mixed rice dish, mainly popular in South Asia. It is made with rice, some type of meat (chicken, goat, lamb, beef, prawn, or fish) and spices. To cater to vegetarians, in some cases, it is prepared by substituting vegetables or paneer for the meat.[1] Sometimes eggs and/or potatoes are also added.[2] Biryani is one of the most popular dishes in South Asia and among the South Asian diaspora, although the dish is often associated with the region's Muslim population in particular.[3] Similar dishes are also prepared in other parts of the world such as in Iraq, Myanmar, Thailand, and Malaysia.[4] Biryani is the single most-ordered dish on Indian online food ordering and delivery services, and has been labelled as the most popular dish overall in India.[3][5] One theory states that it originated from birinj (Persian: \u0628\u0631\u0646\u062c), the Persian word for rice.[6][7] Another theory states that it is derived from biryan or beriyan (Persian: \u0628\u0631\u06cc\u0627\u0646), which means \"to fry\" or \"to roast\".[8][9] It may alternatively be related to the Persian word bereshtan (Persian: \u0628\u0631\u0634\u062a\u0646) which also means \"to roast (onions)\", as the dish is often prepared by flavouring rice with fried onions and meat, besides mild spices. The exact origin of the dish is uncertain, however, it is speculated to have originated in Iran. In North India, different varieties of biryani developed.[6][10] According to historian Lizzie Collingham, the modern biryani developed in the royal kitchens of the Mughal Empire (1526\u20131857) and is a mix of the native spicy rice dishes of India and the Persian polao.[11] Indian restaurateur Kris Dhillon believes that the dish originated in Persia and was brought to India by the Mughals.[12] Salma Hossein, whom the BBC regards as the \"doyenne of Islamic cooking in India\", shares a similar view, asserting that biryani came to India from Persia even before the Mughal era. Food scholar Pushpesh Pant also challenges the Mughal-origin claim, stating that it originated in Iran and that \"there is no evidence that biryani first came to this land with the Mughals. It is far more probable that it travelled with pilgrims and soldier-statesmen of noble descent to the Deccan region in South India\".[13] Another theory claims that the dish was prepared in India before the first Mughal emperor Babur conquered India.[14] The 16th-century Mughal text Ain-i-Akbari makes no distinction between biryanis and pilaf (or pulao): it states that the word \"biryani\" is of older usage in India.[citation needed][15] A similar theory, that biryani came to India with Timur's invasion, appears to be incorrect because there is no record of biryani having existed in his native land during that period.[14] According to Pratibha Karan, who wrote the book Biryani, biryani is of Mughal origin, derived from pilaf varieties brought to the Indian subcontinent by Arab traders. She speculates that the pulao was an army dish in medieval India. Armies would prepare a one-pot dish of rice with whichever meat was available. Over time, the dish became biryani due to different methods of cooking, with the distinction between \"pulao\" and \"biryani\" being arbitrary.[6][14] According to Vishwanath Shenoy, the owner of a biryani restaurant chain in India, one branch of biryani comes from the Mughals, while another was brought by the Arab traders to Malabar in South India.[16] There are various apocryphal stories dating the invention to Shah Jahan's time but Rana Safvi, the distinguished historian, says she could only find a recipe from the later Mughal period, from Bahadur Shah Zafar's time. It is not her claim that there was no biryani before that; just that she has not found a recipe. Other historians who have gone through texts say that the first references to biryani only appear around the 18th century.[17] Some claim that the dish \"oonchoru\" as mentioned in Sangam literature, which dates from between 200 BCE and 200 CE, is a predecessor of modern biryani. This dish, which was served to the soldiers of the Chera kings in Kerala, was said to be made of rice, ghee, meat, turmeric, coriander, pepper, and bay leaf.[18][19][20] The spices used in the preparation of South Indian biryanis, such as those used in the Malabar variety, are distinctive to the region and the Western Ghats. These spices are not found in the Middle East, Persia, or North India, underscoring the unique culinary heritage and local ingredients of South Indian biryani.[18][19][20] In South India, where rice is more widely used as a staple food, several distinct varieties of biryani emerged from Hyderabad in Telangana, Vijayawada in Andhra Pradesh, Mangalore and Bhatkal in Coastal Karnataka, Thalassery and Kozhikode in Malabar Kerala, as well as Ambur and Chettinad in Tamil Nadu.[6][10] Pilaf or pulao, as it is known on the Indian subcontinent, is another mixed rice dish popular in the cuisines of the Indian subcontinent, Central Asia, and Middle Eastern cuisine. Opinions differ on the differences between pulao and biryani, and whether actually there is a difference between the two.[21] According to Delhi-based historian Sohail Hashmi, pulao tends to be plainer than biryani, and consists of meat or vegetables cooked with rice with the bottom layered with potatoes or onions. Biryani contains more gravy (or yakhni), and is often cooked longer, leaving the meat (and vegetables, if present) more tender, and the rice more flavoured. Biryani is also cooked with additional dressings and often would have a light layer of scorched rice at the bottom.[22] Author Pratibha Karan states that while the terms are often applied arbitrarily, the main distinction is that a biryani consists of two layers of rice with a layer of meat (and vegetables, if present) in the middle, while the pulao is not layered.[14] Author Colleen Taylor Sen lists the following distinctions between biryani and pulao:[23] Ingredients for biryani vary according to the region and the type of meat and vegetables used. Meat (chicken, goat, beef, lamb,[26] prawn or fish) is the prime ingredient with rice. As is common in dishes of the Indian subcontinent, vegetables are sometimes also used when preparing biryani. Corn may be used, depending on the season and availability. Navratan biryani tends to use sweeter, richer ingredients such as cashews, sultanas (kismis), and fruits such as apples and pineapples.[22] The spices and condiments used in biryani may include fennel seeds, ghee (clarified butter), nutmeg, mace,[27] pepper, cloves,[27] cardamom, cinnamon, bay leaves, coriander, mint, ginger, onions, tomatoes, green chilies,[26] star anise, and garlic. The premium varieties include saffron.[27] Some commercial recipes for Biryani also include aromatic essences such as Mitha Ittar see attar, kewra and rose water. Dried sour prunes (Alu Bukhara) may also be added to the biryani. In nasi briyani and other variants made in Southeast Asian countries such as Malaysia, Singapore, and Indonesia, typical Southeast Asian spices and aromatics such as pandan leaf may be used alongside typical South Asian spices.[28] The main ingredient that usually accompanies the spices is chicken, lamb or goat meat; special varieties might use beef or seafood instead. The dish may be served with dahi chutney or raita, seekh kebab, korma, curry, a sour dish of aubergine (brinjal), boiled egg, and salad. Biryani can be cooked using one of two styles/techniques, pakki (\"cooked\") and kacchi (\"raw\").[29] There are many types of biryani, whose names are often based on their region of origin. For example, Sindhi biryani developed in the Sindh region of what is now Pakistan, and Hyderabadi biryani developed in the city of Hyderabad in South India. Some have taken the name of the shop that sells it, for example: Haji Biriyani, Haji Nanna Biriyani in Old Dhaka,[30] Fakhruddin Biriyani in Dhaka,[31][32] Students biryani in Karachi, Lucky biryani in Bandra, Mumbai and Baghdadi biryani in Colaba, Mumbai.[22] Biryanis are often specific to the Muslim communities where they originate; they are usually the defining dishes of those communities.[33] Ambur/Vaniyambadi biryani is a variety cooked in the neighboring towns of Ambur and Vaniyambadi in the Tirupattur district of the northeastern part of Tamil Nadu, which has a high Muslim population. It was introduced by the Nawabs of Arcot who once ruled the area. It is typically made with jeera samba rice.[34] The Ambur/Vaniyambadi biryani is accompanied by dhalcha, a sour brinjal curry, and pachadi or raitha (sliced onions mixed with plain yogurt, tomato, chilies, and salt). It has a distinctive aroma and is considered light on the stomach. The usage of spice is moderate, and curd is used as a gravy base. It also has a higher ratio of meat to rice.[15] Ambur-style biriyani is popular as street food all across South India. Beef biryani, as the name implies, uses beef as the meat. In Hyderabad, it is famous as Kalyani biryani, in which buffalo or cow meat is used.[35][36] This meal was started after the Kalyani Nawabs of Bidar came to Hyderabad sometime in the 18th century. The Kalyani biryani is made with small cubes of beef, regular spices, onions, and many tomatoes. It has a distinct tomato, jeera and dhania flavour.[37] In Kerala, beef biryani is well known.[38] This is an integral part of the Navayath cuisine and a specialty of Bhatkal, a coastal town in Karnataka. Its origins are traced to the Persian traders who left behind not only biryani but a variation of kababs and Indian breads. In Bhatkali biryani, the meat is cooked in an onion and green chili-based masala and layered with fragrant rice. It has a unique spicy and heady flavour, and the rice is overwhelmingly white with mild streaks of orange. Its variations include beef, goat, chicken, titar (Partridge), egg, fish, crab, prawn, and vegetable biryani. Though similar to those in Thalassery, this biryani differs with lingering after-notes of mashed onions laced with garlic. A few chilies and spices littered with curry leaves lends a unique flavour to Bhatkal biryani. No oil is used.[39] Bohri biryani, prepared by the Bohris is flavoured with lots of tomatoes.[16] It is popular in Karachi. Chettinad biryani is famous in the Indian state of Tamil Nadu. It is made of jeeraka samba rice, and smells of spices and ghee. It is best taken with nenju elumbu kuzhambu, a spicy and tangy goat meat gravy [citation needed]. The podi kozhi is usually topped with fried onions and curry leaves.[40][41][42][43] Degh ki biryani is a typical biryani made from small cubes of beef or mutton. This biryani is famous in Parbhani and generally served at weddings. The meat is flavoured with ginger, garlic, red chili, cumin, garam masala, fried onion and curd. This biryani is also known as kachay gosht ki biryani or dum biryani, where the meat is marinated and cooked along with short-grained and fine rice. It is left on a slow fire or dum for a fragrant and aromatic flavour. The Delhi version of biryani developed a unique local flavour as the Mughal kings shifted their political capital to the North Indian city of Delhi. Until the 1950s, most people cooked biryani in their home and rarely ate at eateries outside of their homes. Hence, restaurants primarily catered to travellers and merchants. Any region that saw more of these two classes of people nurtured more restaurants, and thus their own versions of biryani. This is the reason why most shops that sold biryani in Delhi, tended to be near mosques such as Jama Masjid (for travellers) or traditional shopping districts (such as Chandni Chowk). Each part of Delhi has its own style of biryani, often based on its original purpose, thus giving rise to Nizamuddin biryani, Shahjahanabad biryani, etc.  Nizamuddin biryani usually had little expensive meat and spices as it was primarily meant to be made in bulk for offering at the Nizamuddin Dargah shrine and thereafter to be distributed to devotees.[22] A non-dum biryani, using many green chillies, popularized by the Babu Shahi Bawarchi shops located outside the National Sports Club in Delhi is informally called Babu Shahi biryani. Another version of Delhi biryani uses achaar (pickles) and is called achaari biryani.[44] The city of Dhaka in Bangladesh is known for selling Chevon Biryani, a dish made with highly seasoned rice and goat meat. The recipe includes: highly seasoned rice, goat meat, mustard oil, garlic, onion, black pepper, saffron, clove, cardamom, cinnamon, salt, lemon, doi, peanuts, cream, raisins and a small amount of cheese (either from cows or buffalo). Haji biryani is a favourite among Bangladeshis living abroad.[45] A recipe was handed down by the founder of one Dhaka restaurant to the next generation. Haji Mohammad Shahed claimed, \"I have never changed anything, not even the amount of salt\".[46] Bengali style biryani often includes potatoes. Dhakaiya Kacchi Biryani is accompanied by borhani, a salted mint drink made of yogurt, coriander, mint and salt. The city of Dindigul in Tamil Nadu is noted for its biryani, which uses a little curd and lemon juice for a tangy taste.[47] Military hotels of Bangalore in Karnataka are known for selling Biryani served in dried plantain leaf bowl called Donne.[48] It is typically made from jeera samba rice, yogurt with lot of common mint and coriander leaves.[49][50] Hyderabadi biryani is India's most famous biryani; some say biryani is synonymous with Hyderabad.[51] Hyderabadi biryani developed under the rule of Asaf Jah I, who was first appointed as the governor of Deccan by the Mughal Emperor Aurangzeb. It is made with basmati rice, spices and goat meat. Popular variations use chicken instead of goat meat. There are various forms of Hyderabadi biryani, such as kachay gosht ki biryani or dum biryani, where goat meat is marinated and cooked along with the rice. It is left on a slow fire or dum for a fragrant and aromatic flavour.[52] Memoni biryani is an extremely spicy variety developed by the Memons of Gujarat-Sindh region in India and Pakistan.[16] It is made with mutton, dahi, fried onions, and potatoes, and fewer tomatoes compared to Sindhi biryani. Kalyani biryani is a typical biryani from the former state of Hyderabad Deccan.[53] Also known as the \"poor man's\"  Hyderabadi biryani, Kalyani biryani is always made from small cubes of buffalo meat. The meat is flavoured with ginger, garlic, turmeric, red chili, cumin, coriander powder, and much onion and tomato. It is first cooked as a thick curry and then cooked along with rice. Then given dum (the Indian method of steaming in a covered pot). Kalyani biryani is supposed to have originated in Bidar during the reign of the Kalyani Nawabs, who migrated to Hyderabad after one of the Nawabs, Ghazanfur Jang married into the Asaf Jahi family uniting their realms. Kalyani biryani was served by the Kalyani Nawabs to all of their subjects who came from Bidar to Hyderabad and stayed or visited their devdi or noble mansion. Calcutta or Kolkata biryani evolved from the Lucknow style when Awadh's last Nawab, Wajid Ali Shah, was exiled in 1856 to the Kolkata suburb of Metiabruz. Shah brought his personal chef with him. The Kolkata biriyani is characterized by the presence of potato in it.[16] A specialty of the Beary Muslim community in coastal Karnataka and is also known as Manglorean-style biryani. The dish is made using lots of green chilly and coconut and has the subtle flavor and aroma of fennel. Spices that include nutmeg, mint leaves, fennel seeds, mace (javitri), poppy seeds, almonds, star anise and others. The rice and meat (mutton, chicken, beef) are cooked separately and then layered and slowly cooked together again. This dish is highly served during marriages and other homely occasions. This type of biryani is popular in the Palakkad and Coimbatore regions. This was most commonly prepared by Rawther families in Kerala and Tamil Nadu. This type of biryani is cooked in a different style. Goat meat is most commonly used and it is entirely different from Malabar biryani.[citation needed] The exotic and aromatic Sindhi biryani is known in Pakistan for its spicy taste, fragrant rice, and delicate meat. Sindhi biryani is a beloved staple in food menus of Pakistani and Sindhi cuisine. Sindhi biryani is prepared with meat and a mixture of basmati rice, vegetables, and various spices. Biryani was brought into Sri Lanka by the South Indian Muslims who were trading in the Northern part of Sri Lanka and in Colombo in the early 1900s.[citation needed] In Sri Lanka, it is Buryani, a colloquial word which generated from Buhari Biryani. In many cases, Sri Lankan biryani is much spicier than most Indian varieties. Side dishes may include acchar, Malay pickle, cashew curry and mint sambol.[citation needed] Thalassery biryani is the variation of biryani found in the Indian state of Kerala. It is one of the many dishes of the Kerala Muslim community, and very popular.[54] The ingredients are chicken, spices and the specialty is the choice of rice called khyma. Khyma rice is generally mixed with ghee. Although a large number of spices such as mace, cashew nuts, sultana raisins, fennel-cumin seeds, tomato, onion, ginger, garlic, shallot, cloves and cinnamon are used,[55] there is only a small amount of chili (or chili powder) used in its preparation. A pakki biryani, the Thalassery biryani uses a small-grained thin (not round) fragrant variety of rice known as khyma or jeerakasala. The dum method of preparation (sealing the lid with dough [maida] or cloth and placing red-hot charcoal above the lid) is applied here to avoid scorched rice. In Myanmar (Burma), biryani is known in Burmese as danpauk or danbauk (\u1012\u1036\u1015\u1031\u102b\u1000\u103a), derived from the Persian term dum pukht, which refers to a slow oven cooking technique. Danbauk is a mainstay at festive events such as Thingyan, weddings and donation feasts.[56][57] Given danbauk's South Asian origins, danbauk restaurants and chains have traditionally been owned by Muslims, but in recent decades Buddhist entrepreneurs have entered the market.[56] Featured ingredients include: cashew nuts, yogurt, raisins and peas, chicken, cloves, cinnamon, saffron and bay leaf cooked in long-grain rice.[58] In danbauk, chicken specially seasoned with a danbauk masala spice mix,[59] is cooked with the rice.[60] Danbauk is typically eaten with a number of side dishes, including a fresh salad of sliced onions, julienned cabbage, sliced cucumbers, fermented limes and lemons, fried dried chilies, and soup.[61] In recent decades, danbauk restaurants have innovated variations, including \"ambrosia\" biryani (\u1014\u1010\u103a\u101e\u102f\u1013\u102c\u1011\u1019\u1004\u103a\u1038), which features dried fruits and buttered rice.[61] In Iraq and in the states of the Persian Gulf, biryani (\u0628\u0631\u064a\u0627\u0646\u064a: \"biryani\") is usually saffron-based with chicken usually being the meat or poultry of choice. It is popular throughout Iraq, especially in the Kurdistan Region.  Most variations also include vermicelli, fried onions, fried potato cubes, almonds, and raisins spread liberally over the rice.[16] Sometimes, a sour/spicy tomato sauce is served on the side (maraq). In Iran, during the Safavid dynasty (1501\u20131736), a dish called Beriyan Polo (Nastaliq script: \u0628\u0631\u06cc\u0627\u0646 \u067e\u0644\u0648) was made with lamb or chicken, marinated overnight\u2014with yogurt, herbs, spices, dried fruits like raisins, prunes or pomegranate seeds\u2014and later cooked in a tannour oven, then served with steamed rice.[citation needed] A different dish called biryan is popular in Afghanistan. Biryan traces its origins to the same source as biryani, and is today sold in Afghanistan as well as in Bhopal, India. Biryan is prepared by cooking gosht and rice together, but without the additional gravy (yakhni) and other condiments that are used in biryani. The Delhi-based historian Sohail Hashmi refers to the biryan as midway between pulao and biryani.  Afghan biryani tends to use much dry fruit such as raisins and lesser amounts of meat, often cut into tiny pieces.[22] Nasi kebuli is an Indonesian spicy steamed rice dish[62] cooked in goat meat broth, milk and ghee.[63] Nasi kebuli is descended from kabuli palaw which is an Afghani rice dish, similar to biryani served in the Indian subcontinent.[64] Although Indonesia has authentic nasi kebuli, Indonesia also inherited and has local-style of biryani which is known as nasi biryani or nasi briyani. Nasi biryani is popular among and often associated as Acehnese, Arab Indonesian, Indian Indonesian and Malay cuisine.[65] The Malaysian and Singaporean variety of biryani is called nasi briyani or nasi biryani. Although authentic styles of biryani from South India are popular, nasi briyani remains the most popular. The key differences between nasi briyani and Indian biryanis are that the meat in nasi briyani is cooked separately from the rice, and there is more curry, sauce, or gravy present in the nasi briyani than in Indian biryanis.[66] Nasi briyani dishes are very popular in Malaysia and Singapore. As an important part of Malaysian and Singaporean Indian cuisines, they are popularized through mamak stalls, hawker centres, and food courts as well as fine dining restaurants. There are also eateries that sell pork as the main meat of the dish in Singapore.[67][68] Biryani dishes are very popular in Mauritius, especially at Muslim weddings and festivities. It is also widely available at street food places. Mauritian biryanis are often accompanied by an achaar (mango pickles), chilies and salads. Kapampangan cuisine of the Philippines (often in Pampanga) features a special dish called nasing biringyi (chicken saffron rice), that is typically prepared only during special occasions such as weddings, family get-togethers or fiestas. It is not a staple of the Filipino diet as it is difficult to prepare compared to other usual dishes. Nasing biringyi is similar to the nasi briyani dish of Malaysia in style and taste. A version that has merged with the Filipino version of the Spanish paella is known as bringhe.[69] In the Cape Malay culture, a variation of biryani incorporates lentils as a key ingredient in the dish along with meat (usually beef, chicken, seafood or vegetables). The dish is made by cooking the rice and legumes and meat and gravy separately, then mixing it. Uncommonly, it is made using the dum-cooking method. The spices are similar to those used in the original Indian biryani. Variants of biryani exist in the cuisines of Somalia, Kenya, and Tanzania due to centuries of trade between the East African coast and South Asia for centuries, and the more recent migration of Indians to the latter two countries more recently during the British colonial era. Zanzibar has its own form of biryani characterized by the mixture of East African and Indian spices, as well as influences from Arab cuisine. The meat used is most commonly chicken.[70] This variant is similar to the forms of biryani served in Kenya. In Somalia, the descendant of biryani is bariis iskukaris. It is served with chicken, goat, beef, lamb, or camel meat, and spiced with the Somali spice mixture xawaash and other spices. A unique characteristic of bariis and other Somali dishes is the addition of banana on the side to be mixed with the dish. Biryani in Thailand is commonly known as khao mhok (Thai: \u0e02\u0e49\u0e32\u0e27\u0e2b\u0e21\u0e01). It is commonly paired with chicken, beef or even fish and topped with fried garlic. The dish is common in Thai cuisine and is often served with a green sour sauce. Tehari and tehri are various names for the vegetarian adaptation of Biryani but are mainly classified as pulao. It was developed for the Hindu bookkeepers of the Muslim Nawabs. It is prepared by adding potatoes to the rice, as opposed to the case of biryani, where the rice is added to the meat. In Kashmir, tehari is sold as street food. Tehari became more popular during World War II, when meat prices increased substantially and potatoes became the popular substitute in biryani. Hot", "Dal": " In Indian cuisine, dal (also spelled daal or dhal in English;[1] pronunciation: [d\u032aa\u02d0l], Hindi: \u0926\u093e\u0932, Urdu: \u062f\u0627\u0644), paruppu (Tamil: \u0baa\u0bb0\u0bc1\u0baa\u0bcd\u0baa\u0bc1), or pappu (Telugu: \u0c2a\u0c2a\u0c4d\u0c2a\u0c41) are dried, split pulses (e.g., lentils, peas, and beans) that do not require soaking before cooking. India is the largest producer of pulses in the world.[2][3] The term is also used for various soups prepared from these pulses. These pulses are among the most important staple foods in South Asian countries, and form an important part of the cuisines of the Indian subcontinent.[4] The word d\u0101l (dal) derives from the Sanskrit verbal root dal- \"to split\",[5][6] which is inherited from Proto-Indo-European *delh\u2081- \u201cto split, divide\u201d.[7][8][9] Lentils are among the most ancient cultivated foods; they have been found in human settlements dating back to the Bronze Age.[10] Researchers have dated the preparation and cooking of split dal as far back as 800-300 BC.[11] Dal as a staple food has been mentioned in many ancient religious texts, including the Yajurveda, the Mahayana Buddhist La\u1e45k\u0101vat\u0101ra S\u016btra, and the Bible: May for me strength, righteousness, milk, sap, ghee, honey, eating and drinking in company, ploughing, rain, conquest, victory, wealth, riches, prosperity, prospering, plenteousness, lordship, much, more, fun, fuller, imperishableness, bad crops, food, freedom from hunger, rice, barley, beans, sesame, kidney beans, vetches, wheat, lentils, millet, Panicum miliaceum, Panicum frumentaceum, and wild rice (prosper through the sacrifice). Now, Mah\u0101mati, the food I have permitted [my disciples to take] is gratifying to all wise people but is avoided by the unwise; it is productive of many merits, it keeps away many evils; and it has been prescribed by the ancient Rishis. It comprises rice, barley, wheat, kidney beans, beans, lentils, etc., [...] food prepared with these is proper food. Then Jacob gave Esau some bread and some lentil stew. He ate and drank, and then got up and left. So Esau despised his birthright. Dal are often prepared in three different forms: The hulling of a pulse is intended to improve digestibility and palatability. It also affects the nutrition provided by the dish, significantly increasing protein and reducing dietary fibre content.[17] Pulses with their outer hulls intact are also quite popular in the Indian subcontinent as the main cuisine. Over 50 different varieties of pulses are known in the Indian subcontinent.[citation needed] Dal is frequently eaten with flatbreads, such as rotis or chapatis, or with rice. The latter combination is called dal bhat in Nepali, Gujarati, and various other Indian languages. In addition, certain types of dal are fried, salted, and eaten as a dry snack, and a variety of savory snacks are made by frying a paste made from soaked and ground dals in different combinations, to which other ingredients, such as spices and nuts (commonly cashews) may be added. Dal preparations are eaten with rice, chapati and naan on the Indian subcontinent. The manner in which it is cooked and presented varies by region. In South India, dal is often called \"paruppu\". It is primarily used to make a dish called sambar. It is also used to make parippu that is mixed with charu and rice. Ground chana dal is used to make a paste called besan, which is used in the preparation of many dishes including bhaji[18] and Mediterranean dishes like farinata. Most dal recipes are quite simple to prepare. The standard preparation begins with boiling a variety of dal (or a mix) in water with some turmeric, salt to taste, and then adding a fried garnish at the end of the cooking process.[19] In some recipes, tomatoes, kokum, unripe mango, jaggery, or other ingredients are added while cooking the dal, often to impart a sweet-sour flavour. The fried garnish for dal goes by many names, including chaunk, tadka/tarka, bagar, fodni, and phoran. The ingredients in the chaunk for each variety of dal vary by region and individual tastes. The raw spices (more commonly cumin seeds, mustard seeds, asafoetida, and sometimes fenugreek seeds and dried red chili pepper) are first fried for a few seconds in the hot oil on medium/low heat. This is generally followed by ginger, garlic, and onion, which are generally fried for 10 minutes. After the onion turns golden brown, ground spices (turmeric, coriander, red chili powder, garam masala, etc.) are added. The chaunk is then poured over the cooked dal. As the main ingredient of dal is the pulse used, it gains much of its nutritional properties from the pulse. Note: All nutrient values including protein are in %DV per 100 grams of the food item. Significant values are highlighted in light gray color and bold letters.[27][28]\nCooking reduction =\u00a0% Maximum typical reduction in nutrients due to boiling without draining for ovo-lacto-vegetables group.[29][30]", "Chole": "Chole can refer to:", "Daal Baati": " Daal bati is an Indian dish of dal (lentils) and bati (hard wheat rolls).[1] It is popular in Rajasthan, Madhya Pradesh (especially in Braj, Nimar and Malwa regions), Maharashtra's Khandesh and Vidarbha region, Gujarat, and Uttar Pradesh. Daal is prepared using tuvaar dal, chana daal (prepared by removing the skin of split chickpeas), mung dal, moth dal, or urad dal. The pulses or lentils are cooked together after being soaked in water for a few hours. First, a small amount of vegetable oil is heated in a frying pan and then the seasoning rai-jeera (mustard and cumin seeds) is added to the hot oil. Then green chilli, garlic and some spices including asafoetida, red chilli, turmeric, coriander, and ginger are added. There may be a sweet and sour version of the dal in some regions. Finally, the boiled daal is added and cooked. Baati is a hard bread made up of wheat flour commonly known as aata. Wheat flour is kneaded with little bit of salt, dahi (yogurt) and water. Tennis ball-sized round balls of this dough are cooked in a well-heated traditional oven or in an earthen stove. When the Baati becomes golden brown in colour, it is greased with ghee and is then served with daal, rava laddoo, rice, pudina chutney, kairi (raw mango) chutney, garlic chutney, green salad with  much onion, and fresh buttermilk. 'Dal Baati Churma'[2] is a traditional delicacy from the state of Rajasthan. It is associated with the festivals of Makar Sankranti and Diwali in the Dhundhand region. It is also prepared on special occasions like marriage ceremonies and housewarming. Dal Baati is eaten with Churma popularly in regions of Rajasthan and Haryana. Churma is a sweet delicacy made of coarsely grounded wheat flour, bajra (millet) flour,[3] or semolina. It is made by grinding the fire-baked or fried dough balls and mixing them with ghee, powdered sugar or jaggery and dry fruits. Bharta, made with eggplants is also a popular companion of Dal Baati. This rustic sphere of baked deliciousness is revered as much for its simplicity as for its unforgettable taste. And yet when it comes to tracing the story behind this culinary masterpiece, there is not much available. People in the western region of India, i.e., Rajasthan, Haryana, and parts of Gujarat have been eating this for generations now.[4] Baati made of unsalted wheat, ghee and camel milk was first mentioned during the time of Bappa Rawal\u2014the founder of the kingdom of Mewar in Rajasthan. They were known as a nomadic warrior tribe before they settled into the tapestry of a kingdom and got Chittor in form of dowry from Maan Mori, Baati was the Guhilot's official wartime meal.[5] It is said that soldiers would break the dough into chunks and leave it buried under thin layers of sand to bake under the sun. So when they returned, they could find perfectly baked roundels that were dunked into ghee and had; on a good day, there would be curd or buttermilk as well. Baati was paired with ghee and curd before Dal and Choorma. Choorma and the Panchmael Dal came as a later addition with time as civilization set in. And though a few anthropologists believe that at the grassroots level, Baati was still paired with ghee and buttermilk or curd made of camel or goat milk. It was the upper caste who enjoyed the combination of Dal and Baati. This can be connected to the result of traders settling in Mewar, or the influence of the Gupta period cooking style where Panchmael Dal was considered a delicacy and was eventually adopted by a royal chef and became popular. The inclusion of Choorma, which is an integral part of the meal today, was yet another innovation that is credited to the House of Mewar. Folklore says that it was during one of the war days when a cook accidentally poured sugarcane juice into the Baati that the Choorma was found. Other tales tell of homemakers who would keep the Baatis in sugar/jaggery water in an attempt to keep the Baatis fresh for their husbands which eventually became Choorma. Perhaps this answers the association of Choorma with Dal Baati. Dal bafla (Hindi: \u0926\u093e\u0932 \u092c\u093e\u092b\u093c\u094d\u0932\u093e) is a variation of Dal Baati, where the normal Bafla is boiled before baking it in a traditional Baati oven. Baati is replaced by the bafla, a softer version of it. It is native (Malwa region) of Madhya Pradesh. Although, parts of Rajasthan have been consuming Bafla and claim it to be native to the place.", "Stew": "A stew is a combination of solid food ingredients that have been cooked in liquid and served in the resultant gravy. Ingredients can include any combination of vegetables and may include meat, especially tougher meats suitable for slow-cooking, such as beef, pork, venison, rabbit, lamb, poultry, sausages, and seafood. While water can be used as the stew-cooking liquid, stock is also common. A small amount of red wine or other alcohol is sometimes added for flavour. Seasonings and flavourings may also be added. Stews are typically cooked at a relatively low temperature (simmered, not boiled), allowing flavours to mingle. Stewing is suitable for the least tender cuts of meat that become tender and juicy with the slow, moist heat method. This makes it popular for low-cost cooking. Cuts with a certain amount of marbling and gelatinous connective tissue give moist, juicy stews, while lean meat may easily become dry. Stews are thickened by reduction or with flour, either by coating pieces of meat with flour before searing or by using a roux or beurre mani\u00e9, a dough consisting of equal parts fat and flour. Thickeners like cornstarch, potato starch, or arrowroot may also be used. Stews have been made since ancient times. The world's oldest known evidence of stew was found in Japan, dating to the J\u014dmon period.[1][2] Amazonian tribes used the shells of turtles as vessels, boiling the entrails of the turtle and various other ingredients in them. There are recipes for lamb stews and fish stews in the Roman cookery book Apicius, believed to date from the 4th century AD. Le Viandier, one of the oldest cookbooks in French, written in the early 14th century by the French chef known as Taillevent, has ragouts or stews of various types in it.[3] The first written reference to 'Irish stew' is in Byron's \"The Devil's Drive\" (1814): \"The Devil\u00a0... dined on\u00a0... a rebel or so in an Irish stew.\"[4] Meat-based white stews also known as blanquettes or fricass\u00e9es are made with lamb or veal that is blanched or lightly seared without browning, and cooked in stock. Brown stews are made with pieces of red meat that are first seared or browned, before a browned mirepoix and sometimes browned flour, stock and wine are added. ", "Vindaloo": "Vindaloo or Vindalho is an Indian curry dish, originally from Vasai and Goa. It is based on the Portuguese dish carne de vinha d'alhos.[1][2][3] It is known globally in its British Indian form as a staple of curry house and Indian restaurant menus and is often regarded as a fiery, spicy dish. The traditional recipe uses pork, but alternative versions have been prepared with beef, mutton, prawns, chicken, lamb, vegetables and tofu.[4] A standard element of Goan cuisine derived from the Portuguese carne de vinha d'alhos (meat in wine and garlic marinade; literally \"meat of wine of garlic\"[5]), a vindaloo is a dish of meat (usually pork) marinated in vinegar and garlic.[3][6] The basic structure of the Portuguese dish was the Portuguese sailor's \"preserved\" raw ingredients, packed in wooden barrels of alternate layers of pork and garlic, and soaked in red wine.[citation needed] This was adapted by the local Goan cooks with the substitution of palm vinegar for the red wine, and the addition of spices. It evolved into the localized and easy-to-pronounce dish \"vindaloo\".[7] The British Indian version of vindaloo calls for the meat to be marinated in vinegar, sugar, fresh ginger and spices, then cooked with more spices.[3] Restaurants in Goa offering traditional Goan cuisine prepare vindalho with pork, which is the original recipe. Christians from Kochi, Kerala prepare it using pork or beef, the former being more widely consumed and made. The dish was popularized by Goan cooks (whom the British favoured, because they had no issues in kitchens and bars when handling beef, pork or alcohol) in the British establishments and the ocean-going liners. Restaurants in other parts of India prepare vindalho with other meats (like beef (second most popular), chicken or goat meat or lamb) or even seafood because of local taboos against pork, and these meats are sometimes mixed with cubed potatoes to reduce preparation costs. Even though the word aloo (\u0906\u0932\u0942) means potato in Hindi,[8] traditional Goan vindalho does not include potatoes; the name is from Portuguese with no Hindi etymology. Some Indian versions do include potatoes due to the confusion with the Hindi aloo,[9] and vindaloo dishes outside India often include potatoes. Vindaloo has gained popularity outside of India, where it is typically featured on menus at Indian restaurants. Vindaloo served in restaurants of the United Kingdom differs from the original vindaloo dish; it is simply a spicier version of the standard \"medium (spiciness)\" restaurant curry with the addition of vinegar, potatoes and chili peppers.[10] Vindaloo is one of the spiciest dishes available on British Asian menus where it is served, although British Bangladeshi restaurants have innovated the tindaloo, which is a quite different dish that originated in Bangladesh.[10] The British variation originated from British Bangladeshi restaurants in the 1970s. Vindaloo is considered a predecessor to phall.[11]", "Ice Cream Cake": "Ice Cream Cake is the debut Korean extended play by the South Korean girl group Red Velvet. It was released digitally on March 17, 2015, and physically on March 18 by SM Entertainment and distributed by Dreamus,[3] marking the group's first proper release since their initial debut in August 2014 and their first release as a quintet since the addition of the group's fifth member Yeri. The extended play was released in two physical versions, named after the two singles and contained six tracks which introduced both the group's \"Red\" and \"Velvet\" sonic concept. The duality was further demonstrated by its two singles (marketed as double title tracks), \"Automatic\" and \"Ice Cream Cake\", with the latter becoming the group's breakthrough commercial success. S.M. founder Lee Soo-man served as the EP's executive producer, with Hayley Aitken, Trinity Music, Daniel \"Obi\" Klein, Charli Taft, Jam Factory, Kenzie, Teddy Riley, Cha Cha Malone, MonoTree and others contributed lyrics and production. Upon its release, Ice Cream Cake received positive reviews from music critics for its \"impressive effort\" of establishing the two sides of their musical identity. The EP also attained commercial success, becoming Red Velvet's first chart-topper on the Gaon Album Chart in South Korea and number two on the Billboard World Albums Chart for the first time, while peaking at number twenty-four on Billboard's Heatseekers Albums chart. It has since sold a cumulative sales of over 94,000 copies. Following the end of \"Be Natural\" promotion in late October 2014, it was announced that Red Velvet would return with an extended play, marking their first proper release since the group's debut in last August. In February 2015, Red Velvet was spotted filming in a desert just outside of Palmdale, California with then SM Rookies-member Yeri, with the then-rumored song title to be \"Blonde Girl\", when they were actually filming the music video for \"Ice Cream Cake\". Yeri was then introduced by S.M. Entertainment as the fifth member of Red Velvet through two videos uploaded on the label's YouTube channel on March 11 and March 12, which contained audio previews of then-unknown album track \"Somethin Kinda Crazy\".[4] On the same day, they revealed the title of the group's first album, Ice Cream Cake.[5] On March 14, the music video for \"Automatic\" was released days prior to the EP's release, with title track \"Ice Cream Cake\" followed suit on March 16.[6] SM Entertainment confirmed that the group would be promoting both \"Ice Cream Cake\" and \"Automatic\".[7] The mini-album was released in two versions, Ice Cream Cake and Automatic. While there are no changes in the track list, the Automatic version has an alternative cover which features the original artwork in black and white, along with the design of the physical disc and the photo book inside is different from the other version. Not only does the group's name \"Red Velvet\" represent their two different images, it also represents the duality sonic concept that the group was focusing on since their debut in 2014.[7][8] While the \"Red\" concept shows the group's \"sweet, bubblegum side\", the \"Velvet\" concept highlights the group as \"sultry sirens\" with \"slow-burning, Janet Jackson-esque R&B jam\".[9] Ice Cream Cake marks the first release from Red Velvet to contain both \"Red\" and \"Velvet\" compositions, which was eventually followed by two different releases that focused solely on a single sonic concept: The Red in September 2015 and The Velvet in March 2016. The extended play starts with the same-name track \"Ice Cream Cake\", a \"punchy, sugary pop confection\" that consists elements from dance-rock, bubblegum-pop and drum and bass. Produced by Hayley Aitken and producing team Trinity Music, the song original title was \"Ice Cream Truck\" before the lyrics was rewritten in Korean by songwriter Jo Yoon-kyung and Kim Dong-hyun. In addition, it also features \"haunted\" harmony which can be heard during the intro of the song, while being accompanied by the sound of a music box. The lyrics tell the excitement of a girl being attracted to her boyfriend, using \"ice cream cake\" as a metaphor to the girl's feelings. Along with the electro-pop \"Stupid Cupid\" and the bright, poppy \"Take It Slow\", the three tracks represent the \"Red\" concept, with \"Stupid Cupid\" offers a different \"aura\" through the electric riffs, and \"Take It Slow\" highlights the group's harmonization and soft vocals that recalls \"the perfection\" from fellow labelmate Girls' Generation-TTS.[10] In contrast, the second track \"Automatic\" is \"a surely implemented R&B track\" with influence from neo soul, thus represents the \"Velvet\" sonic concept. Produced by Daniel \"Obi\" Klein and British singer-songwriter Charli Taft, the song was the first work from the duo with Red Velvet (who would later participate in the group's upcoming releases). Lyrically, the song tells how \"natural\" and \"automatic\" the senses and feelings of a girl come just by the touch of her lover, with the opening monologue \"How do you like this beat?/Natural and automatic for you.\" Charli Taft also co-produced the third track \"Something Kinda Crazy\", a modern-R&B track with synth-pop influence that sings about the starstruck feelings of a girl when she falls in a relationship. The lyrics was written by songwriter Kenzie, with American producer Teddy Riley joined in the production. The closing track \"Candy\" is a \"smoothing, popping\" R&B track that sings about the wishes of a long-lasting relationship. These three tracks eventually represent the group's \"Velvet\" concept, portraying the group's \"sultry\" images and music. SM Entertainment announced a program where the group would promote their new EP, called Ice Cream TV. The group performed the songs live on the show, which was streamed through Naver Music and was hosted by Shinee's Minho. Besides their live performances, the group also talked about the new album and their 'comeback'.[12] The group started promoting their singles \"Automatic\" and \"Ice Cream Cake\" on music shows on March 19. They first performed the songs on Mnet's M Countdown,[13] followed by performances on KBS' Music Bank on March 20[14] and SBS' Inkigayo on March 22.[15] They returned to Music Bank a week later and won their first music show trophy since their official debut.[16] They had their first overseas performance of \"Ice Cream Cake\" and their first as a 5-member group in an SM Town concert held in Taiwan.[17] The group has also promoted and performed songs from the album in the Philippines for the Best of the Best K-pop Concert on April 12, a concert which also featured labelmates Super Junior and Girls' Generation as well as Cube boy band BTOB. The group also had its first promotions in the United States at KCON on August 2 at the Staples Center in downtown Los Angeles. The group participated in a fan engagement session at the Los Angeles Convention Center and performed songs \"Ice Cream Cake\", \"Somethin' Kinda Crazy\", and \"Happiness\" during the concert. Upon its initial release, Ice Cream Cake received positive reviews from most music critics for showcasing the duality sonic concept of the group. Jakob Dorof of pop music magazine Spin described the track \"Ice Cream Cake\" as \"a treat as unexpected as it is unpredictable [...] packs a punch, but goes down smooth over time\" and deemed it \"the SM label's specialty: bubblegum pop that deeply rewards repeat rotations.\"[20] Billboard's Jeff Benjamin called the album \"an impressive effort for such a young group\" and praised its ability to personify the group's dual-sided musical identity through the singles \"Ice Cream Cake\" and \"Automatic.\" He explained: \"The former track is a punchy, sugary pop confection that [...] seems to represent the outfit's sweet bubblegum side; their \"Red\" side if you will. While the latter is a slow-burning, Janet Jackson-esque R&B jam that [...] positions them as sultry sirens; their \"Velvet\" side.\"[9] In a positive review for the EP, writer Kim Do-hyun of IZM complemented the strong R&B influence in the release, while noting that the release is \"an independent statement\" for the group, choosing the two singles, \"Something Kinda Crazy\" and \"Take It Slow\" to be the highlights of the EP.[10] Another review from Seoulbeats described the EP as \"an earnestly sweet album that shows the wide range of talent the ladies of Red Velvet possess.\"[21] The two singles would later appear in the top 25 Red Velvet songs by Billboard, with \"Automatic\" at number nine and \"Ice Cream Cake\" at number eighteen.[22] On the week of March 15, 2015, Ice Cream Cake debuted and spent one week at number one on the weekly Gaon Album Chart,[23][24] giving the group their first chart-topping title. All six songs from the album eventually charted in the same week on Gaon Singles Chart.[25] The album went on to become the best selling album by a girl group in South Korea on the Hanteo Chart for the first half of 2015.[26] With a total of 48,815 copies sold in 2015, the extended play was the 50th best-selling release on the 2015's Gaon Year-End Album Chart, and later achieved a cumulative sales of over 88,000 copies as of September 2018.[27] It also debuted at number two on Billboard's World Albums Chart, becoming their first charting entry.[28] The album also peaked at 25 on Billboard's Top Heatseekers on April 4, 2015.[29] The album is also the group's first appearance on the Japan's Oricon Albums Chart, peaking at number 76 for one week. Credits are from the album liner notes.[30]   ", "Chicken Balls": "Chicken balls are a food consisting of small, spherical or nearly spherical pieces of chicken. They are prepared and eaten in several different cuisines. Chicken balls (Chinese: \u9e21\u7403; pinyin: j\u012b qi\u00fa) are a type of modern Chinese food served in Canada,[1][2][3] the United States, and the United Kingdom[4] as a staple of Chinese take-out. The dish consists of small chunks of fried chicken breast meat covered in a crispy batter coating. They are often served with curry sauce, sweet and sour sauce or plum sauce. These are largely unheard of in China, depending on the recipe and referred name.[5][failed verification] Another kind of chicken balls, which are similar to southern Chinese fish balls, may be found in countries in East and Southeast Asia, such as the Philippines[6] and Japan (tsukune).[7] Chicken balls are also a part of several other culinary traditions, including Italian Jewish cuisine[8] and Islamic cuisine.[9][10]", "Vegetable Stew": "A stew is a combination of solid food ingredients that have been cooked in liquid and served in the resultant gravy. Ingredients can include any combination of vegetables and may include meat, especially tougher meats suitable for slow-cooking, such as beef, pork, venison, rabbit, lamb, poultry, sausages, and seafood. While water can be used as the stew-cooking liquid, stock is also common. A small amount of red wine or other alcohol is sometimes added for flavour. Seasonings and flavourings may also be added. Stews are typically cooked at a relatively low temperature (simmered, not boiled), allowing flavours to mingle. Stewing is suitable for the least tender cuts of meat that become tender and juicy with the slow, moist heat method. This makes it popular for low-cost cooking. Cuts with a certain amount of marbling and gelatinous connective tissue give moist, juicy stews, while lean meat may easily become dry. Stews are thickened by reduction or with flour, either by coating pieces of meat with flour before searing or by using a roux or beurre mani\u00e9, a dough consisting of equal parts fat and flour. Thickeners like cornstarch, potato starch, or arrowroot may also be used. Stews have been made since ancient times. The world's oldest known evidence of stew was found in Japan, dating to the J\u014dmon period.[1][2] Amazonian tribes used the shells of turtles as vessels, boiling the entrails of the turtle and various other ingredients in them. There are recipes for lamb stews and fish stews in the Roman cookery book Apicius, believed to date from the 4th century AD. Le Viandier, one of the oldest cookbooks in French, written in the early 14th century by the French chef known as Taillevent, has ragouts or stews of various types in it.[3] The first written reference to 'Irish stew' is in Byron's \"The Devil's Drive\" (1814): \"The Devil\u00a0... dined on\u00a0... a rebel or so in an Irish stew.\"[4] Meat-based white stews also known as blanquettes or fricass\u00e9es are made with lamb or veal that is blanched or lightly seared without browning, and cooked in stock. Brown stews are made with pieces of red meat that are first seared or browned, before a browned mirepoix and sometimes browned flour, stock and wine are added. ", "Mutton Korma": "Korma or qorma (Urdu: \u0642\u0648\u0631\u0645\u06c1; Hindi: \u0915\u093c\u094b\u0930\u092e\u093e; Bengali: \u0995\u09cb\u09b0\u09ae\u09be); Persian: \u0642\u0631\u0645\u0627); is a dish with its origin in the Indian subcontinent,[1] consisting of meat or vegetables braised with yogurt, water or stock, and spices to produce a thick sauce or gravy.[2] The English name is an anglicisation of the Hindi-Urdu qorm\u0101 (\u0915\u093c\u094b\u0930\u092e\u093e, \u0642\u0648\u0631\u0645\u06c1), meaning \"braise\".[3][4] It refers to the cooking technique used in the dish.[2][5] All these words, and the names of dishes such as the Iranian ghormeh (Persian: \u0642\u0648\u0631\u0645\u0647), Turkish Kavurma and the Azerbaijani qovurma or kavarma, are ultimately derived from a Turkic word qawirma, meaning \"[a] fried thing\".[4] The Indian korma is, however, possibly unrelated in a culinary sense to the modern Turkish kavurma or to some other dishes using the same root word, as they use widely varying techniques and ingredients.[6] Korma has its roots in the Mughlai cuisine[1] of the Indian subcontinent. A characteristic Mughal dish, it can be traced back to the 16th century and to the Mughal expansion into South Asia. Kormas were often prepared in the Mughal court kitchens, such as the famous white korma, perhaps garnished with vark, was said to have been served to Shah Jahan and his guests at the inauguration of the Taj Mahal.[7] Classically, a korma is defined as a dish where meat or vegetables are braised with yogurt or stock. The technique covers many different styles of korma. The flavour of a korma is based on the mixture of spices, including ground coriander and cumin, combined with yogurt kept below curdling temperature and incorporated slowly and carefully with the meat juices. Traditionally, this would have been carried out in a pot set over a very low fire, with charcoal on the lid to provide all-round heat. A korma can be mildly spiced or fiery and may use lamb, goat meat, chicken, beef or game; some kormas combine meat and vegetables, such as spinach and turnip. The term shahi (English: royal), used for some kormas, indicates its status as a prestige dish, rather than an everyday meal, and its association with the court. The korma style is similar to other braising techniques in that the meat or vegetable is first cooked briskly, or seared, using high heat, traditionally with ghee, and then subjected to long, slow cooking using moist heat and a minimum of added liquid.[2] The pot may be sealed with dough during the last stages of cooking, using a technique called dum or dampokhtak.[2] The korma is made using a technique called bagar. in the later stage of cooking, additional spices are mixed with heated ghee and then combined with the sauce formed by the braising. The pan is then covered and shaken to release steam and mix the contents.[8] There is a wide variation between individual korma and other \"curry\" recipes. Chilli and ginger are often used, but the precise method of preparation results in widely different flavors. Indian bay leaves or dried coconut may be added, the latter being a predominantly South Indian flavoring. A korma pilau (pilaf) is a rice and meat dish made with braised meat.[9] In the United Kingdom, a typical korma as served in curry houses is a mildly spiced dish with a thick sauce. It often features almonds, cashews or other nuts, and coconut or coconut milk. In the 21st century, chicken korma has several times been cited as the most popular curry in the UK, replacing chicken tikka masala in surveys of public eating habits.[10][11] Navratan korma is a vegetarian korma made with vegetables and either paneer (an Indian cheese) or nuts \u2013 or sometimes both.[12] Navratan means \"nine gems\", and it is common for the recipe to include nine different vegetables. In some parts of South Asia, korma is used to denote a traditional Eid al-Adha (festival of the sacrifice) dish of lamb, goat, or cow that is braised in minimal or no spices. The flavour comes from the meat and fat of the chosen cuts. It was often done to preserve meats for a short-term period, as the fat layer forms a barrier to help prevent spoilage, similar to potted beef. In Malaysia, korma or 'gulai kurma' is traditionally cooked with coconut milk instead of yoghurt among the Malays, as dairy products do not feature heavily in Malay cuisine. Meats used for kurma include chicken, mutton, beef, and deer. It also often contains more vegetables, such as carrots, potatoes, and tomatoes, though this is not a hard-and-fast rule. Some recipes include tamarind as the souring agent, in place of the natural acidity of yoghurt.[13]", "Saag Paneer": "Saag (Hindustani: [\u02c8s\u0251\u02d0g]), also spelled sag or saga, is an Indian subcontinental leafy vegetable dish eaten with bread, such as roti or naan,[1][2] or in some regions with rice. Saag can be made from mustard greens, collard greens, basella or finely chopped broccoli along with added spices and sometimes other ingredients, such as chhena. In India, it is common, especially in the state of Odisha, where it is eaten with pakhala. In the Shree Jagannath Temple of Puri, saag is one of the dishes offered to Jagannath as part of Mahaprasad. Saag is also common in West Bengal and other regions of North India, where the most common preparation is sarson ka saag (mustard plant leaves), which may be eaten with makki ki roti, a yellow roti made with maize flour.[3] Saag gosht or hariyali maans (spinach and mutton) is a common dish in the North Indian state of Punjab.[4] In Pakistan, it is most commonly eaten in the Punjab province along with Makki ki roti and fresh cow butter or Desi ghee. The word saag is derived from the Sanskrit word shaak (\u015b\u0101ka) meaning leafy green vegetables.[5] In Odia cuisine, s\u0101ga (Odia: \u0b36\u0b3e\u0b17) is one of the most important vegetables. It is popular all over the state. A large variety of plants are used as s\u0101ga in Odisha. A list of the plants that are used as s\u0101ga is as below. In Bengali cuisine, s\u0101g is one of the most important vegetables, being popular throughout the state. Most Bengalis eat at least one dish containing s\u0101g at lunchtime every day - usually fried or accompanied by a little gravy (jhol) and served with rice. A list of the plants that are used as s\u0101g is as below. [8] There are around 70 varieties of saag in Jharkhand.[9] Some are as follows: Saags (Leafy greens) are an important part of the Garhwali, Kumaoni and Jaunsari cuisines of Uttarakhand. The abundance of leafy greens in the state is because of fertile land and forested land. Saags of Sarson (Mustard), Palak (spinach), Mooli (Radish) are common[10] but exclusive saags cooked in the state are:", "Khichda": "Khichra or Khichda (Urdu: \u06a9\u06be\u0686\u0691\u0627) is a variation of the dish Haleem, popular with Muslims of the Indian subcontinent. Khichra is cooked all year and particularly at the Ashura of Muharram. It is made using goat meat, beef, lentils and spices, slowly cooked to a thick paste.[1] It is the meat-based variant of Khichdi, a rice dish from the Indian subcontinent.[2] In Pakistan, beef Haleem and Khichra is sold as street food in most cities throughout the year.[3][4] Khichra and Haleem are very similar dishes; meat is grounded in Haleem while it is left as chunks in Khichra.[5] The origin of Haleem lies in the popular Arabian dish known as Harees (also written as Jareesh). According to Shoaib Daniyal, writing in The Sunday Guardian, the first written recipe of Harees dates back to the 10th century, when Arab scribe Abu Muhammad al-Muzaffar ibn Sayyar compiled a cookbook of dishes popular with the \"kings and caliphs and lords and leaders\" of Baghdad. \"The version described in his Kitab Al-Tabikh (Book of Recipes), the world\u2019s oldest surviving Arabic cookbook, is strikingly similar to the one people in the Middle East eat to this day\" it reported. Harees was introduced to the city by Arab soldiers of the Nizam's army.[6][7][8] As per the Delhi based historian Sohail Hashmi, the Khichra originated as a famine relief measure in the North Indian city of Lucknow while building the Old Imambara of Lucknow. Due to a famine, the then Nawab of Awadh commenced the construction of an Imambargah, announcing that anyone who participated in the construction would be given free food. This free food consisted of rice slowly cooked with mutton and various pulses, thus becoming rich in protein and carbohydrates. This aided a number of famine affected people who would otherwise have died. Once the construction of the Imambargah was completed, the dish continued to get popular and can today be found not just in Lucknow, but a number of cities of the Indian subcontinent. Travellers took this dish to other parts of the Indian subcontinent, where it further acquired a local flavor.[9] In the Indian subcontinent, both Haleem and Khichra are made with same ingredients. Haleem is cooked until the meat blends with the lentils, while in Khichra chunks of meat remain as cubes.[10][11][12] Khichdi is a vegetarian dish with rice and pulses or lentils.", "Shrikhand": " Shrikhand is a traditional sweet of the Indian subcontinent made from strained yogurt. It is often served as part of a thali (platter) or with puris (puffed deep-fried whole wheat bread).[1][2] It is a traditional dessert in Gujarati and Marathi cuisine.[1][2][3] Both Gujaratis and Maharashtrians claim the invention of shrikhand.[3][4] According to a popular legend, shrikhand was invented by traveling herders. To carry their yogurt more easily while traveling overnight, they strained out its whey. Since the strained yogurt became sour by morning, they mixed it with sugar to make it more palatable, leading to the creation of shrikhand.[2] According to food historian K. T. Achaya, shrikhand was first made around 500 BC. His book Indian Food: A Historical Companion states, \"To dewater curd, it was hung in a muslin bag for a few hours; sugar and spices added to the mass yielded shikharini (identical with modern day shrikhand), first noted around 500 BC.\u201d As seen below, this procedure is still followed today.[2][4] The 11th century Kannada poet Chavundaraya II gave a recipe for shikharini as strained yogurt mixed with flavorings and spices in his book on agriculture, the Lokopakara.\"[5][6] The Soopa Shastra, a cookbook written in 1508 by the Jain king Mangarasa III, also mentions shrikhand.[2][3][6] To prepare shrikhand, yogurt is poured onto a cheesecloth. The cheesecloth is tied and hung for several hours to drain the whey. The strained yogurt is transferred to a bowl, and sugar, saffron, and cardamom are added. The mixture is whisked thoroughly to blend the flavors and impart a smooth, creamy texture. It is then covered, chilled for a few hours, and served. The prepared shrikhand may be garnished with almonds or pistachios before serving.[2][7]", "Bread Pudding": "Bread pudding is a bread-based dessert popular in many countries' cuisines. It is made with stale bread and milk or cream, generally containing eggs, a form of fat such as oil, butter or suet and, depending on whether the pudding is sweet or savory, a variety of other ingredients. Sweet bread puddings may use sugar, syrup, honey, dried fruit, nuts, as well as spices such as cinnamon, nutmeg, mace, or vanilla. The bread is soaked in the liquids, mixed with the other ingredients, and baked. Savory puddings like breakfast strata may be served as main courses, while sweet puddings are typically eaten as desserts. In other languages, its name is a translation of \"bread pudding\" or even just \"pudding\", for example \"pud\u00edn\" or \"bud\u00edn\".[1][2] In the Philippines, banana bread pudding is popular. In Mexico, there is a similar dish eaten during Lent called capirotada.[3][4] In Liverpool in the United Kingdom, a moist version of Nelson cake, itself a bread pudding, is nicknamed \"Wet Nelly\".[5][6] Bread pudding originated with 11th-century English cooks who repurposed leftover stale bread. In the following centuries, the dish became known as \"poor man's pudding\" because of the scarcity of food at the time, with the pudding being made only with boiling water, sugar, and spices.[7][8][better\u00a0source\u00a0needed] It was only in the 13th century that eggs and milk were added to the recipe, which then became known as \"bread and butter pudding\".[8] The 18th-century English cookbook The Compleat Housewife contains two recipes for baked bread pudding. The first is identified as \"A Bread and Butter Pudding for Fasting Days\". To make the pudding a baking dish is lined with puff pastry, and slices of penny loaf with butter, raisins and currants, and pieces of butter are added in alternating layers. Over this is poured thickened, spiced cream and orange blossom water, and the dish is baked in the oven. There is another version of the dish that is simpler, omitting the spices and dried fruits. With the arrival of the first settlers in the 13 English Colonies in America, bread pudding became popular in the colonies and later in the United States.[8] In Belgium, particularly Brussels, bread pudding is baked with brown sugar, cinnamon, stale bread, and raisins or apple.[9] In Canada, bread pudding is sometimes made with maple syrup.[10] In Hong Kong, bread pudding is usually served with vanilla cream dressing.[11][better\u00a0source\u00a0needed] In Hungary, it is called M\u00e1glyarak\u00e1s (literally, \"bonfire\") which is baked with whipped egg whites on top.[12] In Malaysia, bread pudding is eaten with custard sauce.[citation needed] In Mecklenburg-Vorpommern, Germany, black bread is used to make \"black bread pudding\" (Schwarzbrotpudding).[13] In the Philippines, stale unsold bread are commonly used by bakeries to make the characteristically bright red filling of pan de regla.[14] In the United States, especially Louisiana, bread puddings are typically sweet and served as dessert with a sweet sauce of some sort, such as whiskey sauce, rum sauce, or caramel sauce, but typically sprinkled with sugar and eaten warm in squares or slices. Sometimes, bread pudding is served warm topped with or alongside a dollop of whipped cream or a scoop of vanilla ice cream.[15] In Puerto Rico, there are many variations of bread pudding on the island. Cream cheese with lime zest and guava or coconut-sweet plantain with rum raisins is perhaps the most popular. Bread pudding is always made with a variety of spices. Puerto Rican bread pudding is cooked the same as cr\u00e8me caramel with caramel poured into a baking dish and then the pudding mix is poured on top. The baking dish is placed in a bain-marie and then in the oven.[16] In Argentina, Peru, Paraguay, and Uruguay, bread pudding is known as \"bud\u00edn de pan\".[17][18] In Brazil, bread pudding is known as \"pudim de p\u00e3o\". The dish consists of bread, eggs, milk, condensed milk, butter, vanilla extract, and a pinch of cinnamon (optional). However, all the ingredients are mixed together in a blender and poured into a bundt-like mold (with a hole in the middle) lined with caramelized sugar syrup, which is then baked in a water bath for about 1 hour and a half. Afterwards, it is left to cool before unmolding and serving. When ready, its appearance can be compared to a creamy yet dense flan.[19] In Panama, bread pudding is known as \"mamallena\".[20] In Aruba, bread pudding is known as \"pan bolo\".[citation needed] In Cuba, bread pudding is known as \"pud\u00edn de pan\" and many serve it with a guava marmalade.[1] In Chile, bread pudding is known as \"colegial\" or \"bud\u00edn de pan\".[2] In Mexico it is simply known as \"bud\u00edn\" and is usually made with bolillo leftovers. It's typically made with raisins and pecans. In Czech Republic and Slovakia bread pudding is known as \"\u017eem\u013eovka\" and is most commonly made of apples and rohl\u00edks or veka, soaked in sweet milk. In Southeast Asian regions like Malaysia, Singapore, and Indonesia, bread pudding is sometimes found in local dessert shops. To cater to local preferences, it may incorporate ingredients such as coconut milk, pandan leaves, palm sugar, and tropical fruits. In Turkey, bread pudding is known as ekmek kaday\u0131f\u0131 and served with a slice of kaymak or ice cream on top of the cake which is garnished with ground pistachio or shredded coconut. In Myanmar, bread pudding known as \"Pu Tin\" in Burmese has been a popular dessert since colonial times. It is also added to a desert known as Falooda.[21] In Bangladesh, a variation of bread pudding called Shahi Tukra, has existed in the region since Mughal times. Shahi Tukra (also spelled Tukda) is known in Hyderabad as Double Ka Meetha.", "Black-Eyed Peas": " Black Eyed Peas (also known as The Black Eyed Peas) is an American musical group consisting of rappers will.i.am, apl.de.ap and Taboo. The group's lineup during the height of their popularity in the 2000s[5] featured Fergie, who replaced Kim Hill in 2002. Originally an alternative hip hop group, they subsequently refashioned themselves as a more marketable pop-rap act.[4] Although the group was founded in Los Angeles in 1995, it was not until the release of their third album Elephunk in 2003 that they achieved high record sales. The Black Eyed Peas' first major hit was the 2003 single \"Where Is the Love?\" from Elephunk, which topped the charts in 13 countries, including the United Kingdom, where it spent seven weeks at number one and went on to become Britain's biggest-selling single of 2003. Their fourth album, Monkey Business, was an even bigger worldwide success, and became certified 3\u00d7 Platinum in the United States. In 2009, the group became one of only 11 artists to have simultaneously held the number-one and number-two spots on the Billboard Hot 100, with their singles \"Boom Boom Pow\" and \"I Gotta Feeling\", which topped the chart for an unprecedented 26 consecutive weeks. The album The E.N.D. produced a third Hot 100 number-one placement with \"Imma Be\", making the group one of few to ever place three number one singles on the chart from the same album, before being followed with \"Rock That Body\" and \"Meet Me Halfway\", which peaked in the top 10 of the Hot 100. \"I Gotta Feeling\" became the first single to sell more than one million downloads in the United Kingdom.[6] At the 52nd Grammy Awards ceremony, held in January 2010, they won three awards out of six nominations. In November 2010, they released the album The Beginning. In February 2011, they performed in the Super Bowl XLV halftime show. Shortly after, the group announced they would be going on indefinite hiatus to pursue other activities, eventually reuniting in 2015. In 2018, Fergie was announced to have left the group after making sporadic appearances with them since their return in 2015. That year, she was subsequently replaced by J. Rey Soul for touring, who also appeared as a featured artist on select tracks on the group's seventh album, Masters of the Sun Vol. 1. They released their eighth album, Translation, in June 2020 and their ninth, Elevation in November 2022. The Black Eyed Peas have sold an estimated 80 million records, making them one of the best-selling groups of all time.[7] They were ranked 12th on Billboard's 2000s Decade-End Artist of the Decade Chart, and 7th on the Hot 100 Artists of the Decade. In 1988, while attending two different high schools, William James Adams Jr and Allan Pineda Lindo Jr met at the all-ages dance venue Club What? in Los Angeles. They formed a hip-hop dance and music crew named Tribal Nation. Adams took the stage name Will 1X while Pineda Lindo adopted the name apl.de.ap. Their friends joined the group \u2013 Dante Santiago and Mooky Mook, followed shortly by DJ Motiv8. Actor David Faustino opened an all-ages club named Balistyx in 1991 inside the old Whisky a Go Go, and Tribal Nation played there. Rapper Eazy-E caught their show and signed the group to Ruthless Records, changing the group name to Atban Klann. Their first album project, Grass Roots, was shelved at the end of 1993, never to be released. They released a promo song \"Let Me Get Down\" in 1994, billed as being produced by the Black Eyed Peas: the production team of DJ Motiv8 and Will 1X. Mooky Mook left the group in 1995, and Eazy-E died of HIV/AIDS. The group's contract with Ruthless was stalled, so Santiago also left the group. Will 1X changed his stage name to will.i.am.[8] In 1995, will.i.am and apl.de.ap formed a new group named Black Eyed Pods with Jaime Gomez (Taboo), and Kim Hill, a singer who featured on a selected number of their tracks. They later changed \"Pods\" to \"Peas\".[9] Unlike the \"gangsta rap\" sounds of Los Angeles\u2013based hip hop acts at the time, the trio performed with a live band and adopted a conscious musical and appearance style. After being signed to Interscope Records and releasing their debut, Behind the Front (1998) the group (and their accompanying live band) earned critical acclaim. One of the singles from the album was \"Joints & Jam\", and was featured on the Bulworth soundtrack. Singer Sierra Swan appeared as a guest on the 1998 song \"Fallin' Up\". Their second album, Bridging the Gap (2000), produced the singles \"Weekends\" featuring Esthero and \"Request + Line\" featuring R&B singer Macy Gray. Hill left the band while producing the album, but was still featured on the album tracks for \"Hot\" and \"Tell Your Mama Come\" as well as in the video for \"Weekends\". In 2002, Stacy Ferguson was chosen as the lead singer, after being introduced to the band by Santiago.[10] Their new album, Elephunk, indicated a shift to a polished pop sound designed to attract mass audiences. In a positive review of the Black Eyed Peas' new-found style, Rolling Stone noted that after the group \"hired a blond bombshell named Stacy 'Fergie' Ferguson and gave up their pursuit of backpack-rapper cred, they have made a kind of spiritual practice of recording futuristic songs \u2013 a total aesthetic commitment that extends from their garish wardrobes to their United Colors of Benetton worldview.\"[11] From Elephunk came \"Where Is the Love?\", which became the Black Eyed Peas' first major hit, peaking at No. 8 on the U.S. Hot 100. It was more successful abroad, topping the charts in several other countries, including seven weeks at No. 1 in the United Kingdom, where it became the biggest-selling single of 2003. The single had similar results in Australia, staying at No. 1 for six weeks. In an interview with TalkofFame.com, Taboo shared that Justin Timberlake's split with Britney Spears impacted the recording of \"Where Is the Love?\".[12] The album subsequently spawned \"Shut Up\", which peaked at No. 2 in the UK and topped the charts and went gold and platinum in the U.S., UK, Germany, and other European markets. The third single from the album, although significantly restyled from the original Elephunk version, \"Hey Mama\" hit the top 5 in Australia and the top 10 in the UK, Germany and other European countries and reached No. 23 in the U.S. The song received even more exposure in 2003 when it was featured in the first \"silhouette\" television commercial for the iPod. The fourth single from the album was \"Let's Get It Started\". It won a 2005 Grammy for Best Rap Performance by a Duo or Group and also received two nominations for Record of the Year and Best Rap Song. In 2004, the Black Eyed Peas embarked on their international Elephunk Tour, touring many countries in Europe, Africa, and Asia. Their fourth album, Monkey Business, was recorded through 2004 and was released on May 25, 2005. Much of the pre-production writing was performed on the John Lennon Educational Tour Bus while on the Black Eyed Peas tour of 2004. The album's first single, \"Don't Phunk with My Heart\", was a hit in the U.S., reaching number three on the Billboard Hot 100. This Billboard status was the highest peak yet of their career in the U.S. (this was later broken when \"Boom Boom Pow\" peaked at the top spot of the Billboard Hot 100) and earned them another Grammy for Best Rap Performance by a Duo or Group. The song reached three in the UK, and five in Canada, and stayed at number one for three weeks in Australia. Some radio stations, concerned about complaints of obscenity, played an alternative version, \"Don't Mess with My Heart\". \"Don't Lie\", the second single from the album, saw success on the U.S. Hot 100, reaching No. 14, although becoming somewhat more successful in the UK and Australia, reaching a peak of No. 6 in both countries. \"My Humps\", another song from the album, immediately achieved commercial success in the U.S. and also garnered fairly substantial radio play despite the sexually suggestive lyrics. It reached number three on the U.S. Hot 100 and number one in Australia, making it their fourth Australian number one single. However, many mocked the song for its poor lyrical content.

Current Touring Former Timeline", "Spicy Chicken": " Chicken is the most common type of poultry in the world.[3] Owing to the relative ease and low cost of raising chickens\u2014in comparison to mammals such as cattle or hogs\u2014chicken meat (commonly called just \"chicken\") and chicken eggs have become prevalent in numerous cuisines. Chicken can be prepared in a vast range of ways, including baking, grilling, barbecuing, frying, and boiling. Since the latter half of the 20th century, prepared chicken has become a staple of fast food. Chicken is sometimes cited as being more healthful than red meat, with lower concentrations of cholesterol and saturated fat.[4] The poultry farming industry that accounts for chicken production takes on a range of forms across different parts of the world. In developed countries, chickens are typically subject to intensive farming methods while less-developed areas raise chickens using more traditional farming techniques. The United Nations estimates there to be 19 billion chickens on Earth in 2011, making them outnumber humans more than two to one.[5] The modern chicken is a descendant of red junglefowl hybrids along with the grey junglefowl first raised thousands of years ago in the northern parts of the Indian subcontinent.[6] Chicken as a meat has been depicted in Babylonian carvings from around 600 BC.[7] Chicken was one of the most common meats available in the Middle Ages.[8][9] For thousands of years, a number of different kinds of chicken have been eaten across most of the Eastern hemisphere,[10] including capons, pullets, and hens. It was one of the basic ingredients in blancmange, a stew usually consisting of chicken and fried onions cooked in milk and seasoned with spices and sugar.[11] In the United States in the 1800s, chicken was more expensive than other meats and it was \"sought by the rich because [it is] so costly as to be an uncommon dish.\"[12] Chicken consumption in the U.S. increased during World War II due to a shortage of beef and pork.[13] In Europe, consumption of chicken overtook that of beef and veal in 1996, linked to consumer awareness of bovine spongiform encephalopathy (mad cow disease).[14] 357 million tonnes of meat were produced in 2021, 53% more than in 2000, with chicken meat representing more than half the increase. Chicken meat was the most produced type of meat in 2021 just ahead of pig meat.[15] Modern varieties of chicken such as the Cornish Cross, are bred specifically for meat production, with an emphasis placed on the ratio of feed to meat produced by the animal. The most common breeds of chicken consumed in the U.S. are Cornish and White Rock.[16] Chickens raised specifically for food are called broilers. In the U.S., broilers are typically butchered at a young age. Modern Cornish Cross hybrids, for example, are butchered as early as 8 weeks for fryers and 12 weeks for roasting birds.[citation needed] Capons (castrated cocks) produce more and fattier meat. For this reason, they are considered a delicacy and were particularly popular in the Middle Ages.[citation needed] Chicken meat contains about two to three times as much polyunsaturated fat as most types of red meat when measured as weight percentage.[23] Chicken generally includes low fat in the meat itself (castrated roosters excluded).[citation needed] The fat is highly concentrated on the skin.[citation needed] 100 grams (3.5\u00a0oz) of raw chicken breast contains 2 grams (0.071\u00a0oz) of fat and 22 grams (0.78\u00a0oz) of protein, compared to 9 grams (0.32\u00a0oz) of fat and 20 grams (0.71\u00a0oz) of protein for the same portion of raw beef flank steak.[24][25] In factory farming, chickens are routinely administered with the feed additive roxarsone, an organoarsenic compound which partially decomposes into inorganic arsenic compounded in the flesh of chickens, and in their feces, which are often used as a fertilizer.[26] The compound is used to control stomach pathogens and promote growth. In a 2013 sample conducted by the Johns Hopkins School of Public Health of chicken meat from poultry producers that did not prohibit roxarsone, 70% of the samples in the US had levels which exceeded the safety limits as set by the FDA.[27] The FDA has since[dubious \u2013 discuss] revised its stance on safe limits to inorganic arsenic in animal feed by stating that \"any new animal drug that contributes to the overall inorganic arsenic burden is of potential concern\".[28] The FDA approval for roxarsone and two other arsenic poultry drugs were voluntarily withdrawn by the manufacturers in September 2013.[29] The final remaining arsenic drug nitarsone was banned at the end of 2015.[30] Information obtained by the Canadian Integrated Program for Antimicrobial Resistance (CIPARS) \"strongly indicates that cephalosporin resistance in humans is moving in lockstep with the use of the drug in poultry production\". According to the Canadian Medical Association Journal, the unapproved antibiotic ceftiofur is routinely injected into eggs in Quebec and Ontario to discourage infection of hatchlings. Although the data are contested by the industry, antibiotic resistance in humans appears to be directly related to the antibiotic's use in eggs.[31] A study by the Translational Genomics Research Institute showed that nearly half (47%) of the meat and poultry in US grocery stores was contaminated with S. aureus, with more than half (52%) of those bacteria resistant to antibiotics.[32] Furthermore, as per the FDA, more than 25% of retail chicken is resistant to 5 or more different classes of antibiotic treatment drugs in the United States.[33] An estimated 90\u2013100% of conventional chicken contains, at least, one form of antibiotic resistance microorganism, while organic chicken has been found to have a lower incidence at 84%.[34][35] In random surveys of chicken products across the United States in 2012, the Physicians Committee for Responsible Medicine found 48% of samples to contain fecal matter. On most commercial chicken farms, the chickens spend their entire life standing in, lying on, and living in their own manure, which is somewhat mixed in with the bedding material (e.g., sawdust, wood shavings, chopped straw, etc.). During shipping from the concentrated animal feeding operation farm to the abattoir, the chickens are usually placed inside shipping crates that usually have slatted floors. Those crates are then piled 5 to 10 rows high on the transport truck to the abattoir. During shipment, the chickens tend to defecate, and that chicken manure tends to sit inside the crowded cages, contaminating the feathers and skin of the chickens, or rains down upon the chickens and crates on the lower levels of the transport truck. By the time the truck gets to the abattoir, most chickens have had their skin and feathers contaminated with feces. There is also fecal matter in the intestines. While the slaughter process removes the feathers and intestines, only visible fecal matter is removed.[36] The high speed automated processes at the abattoir are not designed to remove this fecal contamination on the feather and skin. The high speed processing equipment tend to spray the contamination around to the birds going down the processing line, and the equipment on the line itself. At one or more points on most abattoirs, chemical sprays and baths (e.g., bleach, acids, peroxides, etc.) are used to partially rinse off or kill this bacterial contamination. The fecal contamination, once it has occurred, especially in the various membranes between the skin and muscle, is impossible to completely remove. Chicken is sold both as whole birds and broken down into pieces. In the United Kingdom, juvenile chickens of less than 28 days of age at slaughter are marketed as poussin. Mature chicken is sold as small, medium or large. In the United States, whole mature chickens are marketed as fryers, broilers, and roasters. Fryers are the smallest size (2.5-4\u00a0lbs dressed for sale), and the most common, as chicken reach this size quickly (about 7 weeks). Broilers are larger than fryers. Roasters, or roasting hens, are the largest chickens commonly sold (3\u20135 months and 6-8\u00a0lbs) and are typically more expensive. Even larger and older chickens are called stewing chickens but these are no longer usually found commercially. The names reflect the most appropriate cooking method for the surface area to volume ratio. As the size increases, the volume (which determines how much heat must enter the bird for it to be cooked) increases faster than the surface area (which determines how fast heat can enter the bird). For a fast method of cooking, such as frying, a small bird is appropriate: frying a large piece of chicken results in the inside being undercooked when the outside is ready. Chicken is also sold broken down into pieces. Such pieces usually come from smaller birds that would qualify as fryers if sold whole. Pieces may include quarters, or fourths of the chicken. A chicken is typically cut into two leg quarters and two breast quarters. Each quarter contains two of the commonly available pieces of chicken. A leg quarter contains the thigh, drumstick and a portion of the back; a leg has the back portion removed. A breast quarter contains the breast, wing and portion of the back; a breast has the back portion and wing removed. Pieces may be sold in packages of all of the same pieces, or in combination packages. Whole chicken cut up refers to either the entire bird cut into 8 individual pieces. (8-piece cut); or sometimes without the back. A 9-piece cut (usually for fast food restaurants) has the tip of the breast cut off before splitting. Pick of the chicken, or similar titles, refers to a package with only some of the chicken pieces, typically the breasts, thighs, and legs without wings or back. Thighs and breasts are sold boneless or skinless. Chicken livers and gizzards are commonly available packaged separately. Other parts of the chicken, such as the neck, feet, combs, etc. are not widely available except in countries where they are in demand, or in cities that cater to ethnic groups who favor these parts. Worldwide, there are many fast food restaurant chains that sell exclusively or primarily poultry products including KFC (global), Red Rooster (Australia), Hector Chicken (Belgium) and CFC (Indonesia). Most of the products on the menus in such eateries are fried or breaded and are served with french fries. Raw chicken may contain Salmonella. The safe minimum cooking temperature recommended by the U.S. Department of Health & Human Services is 165\u00a0\u00b0F (74\u00a0\u00b0C) to prevent foodborne illness because of bacteria and parasites.[37] However, in Japan raw chicken is sometimes consumed in a dish called torisashi, which is sliced raw chicken served in sashimi style. Another preparation is toriwasa which is lightly seared on the outsides while the inside remains raw.[38] Chicken can be cooked in many ways. It can be made into sausages, skewered, put in salads, traditionally grilled or by using electric grill, breaded and deep-fried, or used in various curries. There is significant variation in cooking methods amongst cultures. Historically common methods include roasting, baking, broasting, and frying. Western cuisine frequently has chicken prepared by deep frying for fast foods such as fried chicken, chicken nuggets, chicken lollipops or Buffalo wings. They are also often grilled for salads or tacos. Eastern cuisine has chicken prepared by marination, especially chicken Philippine adobo.[39] Chickens often come with labels such as \"roaster\", which suggest a method of cooking based on the type of chicken. While these labels are only suggestions, ones labeled for stew often do not do well when cooked with other methods.[40] Some chicken breast cuts and processed chicken breast products include the moniker \"with rib meat\". This is a misnomer, as it refers to the small piece of white meat that overlays the scapula, removed along with the breast meat. The breast is cut from the chicken and sold as a solid cut, while the leftover breast and true rib meat is stripped from the bone through mechanical separation for use in chicken franks, for example. Breast meat is often sliced thinly and marketed as chicken slices, an easy filling for sandwiches. Often, the tenderloin (pectoralis minor) is marketed separately from the breast (pectoralis major). In the US, \"tenders\" can be either tenderloins or strips cut from the breast. In the UK the strips of pectoralis minor are called \"chicken mini-fillets\". Chicken bones are hazardous to health as they tend to break into sharp splinters when eaten, but they can be simmered with vegetables and herbs for hours or even days to make chicken stock. In Asian countries it is possible to buy bones alone as they are very popular for making chicken soups, which are said to be healthy. In Australia the rib cages and backs of chickens after the other cuts have been removed are frequently sold cheaply in supermarket delicatessen sections as either \"chicken frames\" or \"chicken carcasses\" and are purchased for soup or stock purposes. Raw chicken maintains its quality longer than fresh in the freezer, as moisture is lost during cooking.[43] There is little change in nutrient value of chicken during freezer storage.[43] For optimal quality, however, a maximum storage time in the freezer of 12 months is recommended for uncooked whole chicken, 9 months for uncooked chicken parts, 3 to 4 months for uncooked chicken giblets, and 4 months for cooked chicken.[43] Freezing does not usually cause color changes in poultry, but the bones and the meat near them can become dark. This bone darkening results when pigment seeps through the porous bones of young poultry into the surrounding tissues when the poultry meat is frozen and thawed.[43] It is safe to freeze chicken directly in its original packaging, but this type of wrap is permeable to air and quality may diminish over time. Therefore, for prolonged storage, it is recommended to overwrap these packages.[43] It is recommended to freeze unopened vacuum packages as is.[43] If a package has accidentally been torn or has opened while food is in the freezer, the food is still safe to use, but it is still recommended to overwrap or rewrap it.[43] Chicken should be away from other foods, so if they begin to thaw, their juices will not drip onto other foods.[43] If previously frozen chicken is purchased at a retail store, it can be refrozen if it has been handled properly.[43] Bacteria survives but does not grow in freezing temperatures. However, if frozen cooked foods are not defrosted properly and are not reheated to temperatures that kill bacteria, chances of getting a foodborne illness greatly increase.[44] This article incorporates text from a free content work.

Hot and cold", "Kheer": " Kheer, also known as payasam or payesh, is a pudding/porridge popular in the Indian subcontinent, usually made by boiling milk, sugar or jaggery, and rice. It can be additionally flavored with dried fruits, nuts, cardamom and saffron. Instead of rice, it may contain cracked wheat, vermicelli (sevai) or tapioca (sabudana).[1] In Southern India, it is known as payasam and it is made in various ways. The most popular versions are the ones made with rice and vermicelli (semiya). [1] The word kheer is derived from the Sanskrit word for milk, kshira (\u0915\u094d\u0937\u0940\u0930). Kheer is also the archaic name for sweet rice pudding. The word p\u0101yasam used in South Indian circles is related to the Sanskrit payas, milk\". It is said to have originated initially in South India thousands of years ago. The story is titled \u201cThe Legend of Chessboard\u201d in Kerala, an old sage in the form of Krishna challenged the king of Ambalapuzha (Chess enthusiasts) to play chess. To motivate the Sage, the king offered anything that the sage would name. The sage modestly asked just for a few grains of rice but under one condition: the king has to put a single grain of rice on the first chess square and double it on every consequent one. Krishna (the Sage) won the game and as mentioned the king started placing the grains. As he stacked them, he was shocked to see the number grow exponentially. In the end, the number came up to trillions. Krishna reveals himself and asks the king to provide Kheer to every pilgrim who comes to his temple there. The Ambalapuzha Krishna temple still follows this and it's located in Kerala\u2019s Alappuzha district.[2] According to the food historian K. T. Achaya, kheer or payasam, as it is known in southern India, was a popular dish in ancient India. First mentioned in ancient Indian literature, it was a mixture of rice, milk and sugar, a formula that has endured for over two thousand years. Payasam was also a staple Hindu temple food, in particular, and it is served as Pras\u0101da to devotees in temples.[3]", "Brown Rice": "Brown rice is a whole grain rice with the inedible outer hull removed. This kind of rice sheds its outer hull or husk but the bran and germ layer remain on, constituting the brown or tan colour of rice. White rice is the same grain without the hull, the bran layer, and the cereal germ. Red rice, gold rice, and black rice (also called purple rice) are all whole rices with differently pigmented outer layers. Brown rice generally needs longer cooking times than white rice, unless it is broken or flour blasted (which perforates the bran without removing it).[1] Studies in 2003 estimated a cooking time between 35 and 51 minutes.[2] A shorter cooking time is necessary for \"converted\" or parboiled rice. Brown rice has a shelf life of approximately 6 months,[3] but hermetic storage, refrigeration or freezing can significantly extend its lifetime. Freezing, even periodically, can also help control infestations of Indian meal moths. Cooked, long-grain brown rice is 70% water, 26% carbohydrates, 3% protein, and 1% fat. In a reference amount of 100 grams (3.5\u00a0oz), cooked brown rice supplies 123 calories of food energy, and is a rich source (20% or more of the Daily Value, DV) of manganese (36% DV) and moderate source (11-17% DV) of magnesium, phosphorus, niacin, and thiamine. Arsenic is in the natural environment and may be present in common grains, such as brown rice.[6] Although rice may absorb arsenic more readily than other crops, rice remains as a staple of a well-balanced diet, particularly when fortified with micronutrients in infant rice cereal.[7] Cooking brown rice in hot water can reduce the content of inorganic arsenic by 40-60%, although this cooking method also diminishes the content of micronutrients.[7] Brown rice is widely cultivated in Vietnam,[8][9] mainly in the northern and central provinces.[10][11] According to statistics from the Ministry of Agriculture and Rural Development, the area of brown rice cultivation in Vietnam in 2023 reached 150,000 hectares,[12][13][14] with a production of 1.2 million tons. Brown rice has high economic value and is popular in the market.[15][16] The price of brown rice is usually higher than white rice by 10-20%.[17][18] Brown rice has great potential for development in Vietnam,[19][20][21] and could become a major export product.[22][23]", "Chaat": " Chaat, or ch\u0101t (IAST:  c\u0101\u1e6d) (lit.\u2009'lick, tasting, delicacy') is a family of savoury snacks that originated in India, typically served as an hors d'oeuvre or at roadside tracks from stalls or food carts across South Asia in India, Pakistan, Nepal and Bangladesh.[1][2] With its origins in Uttar Pradesh, India,[3] chaat has become immensely popular in the rest of South Asia. The word derives from Hindi c\u0101\u1e6d \u091a\u093e\u091f (tasting, a delicacy), from c\u0101\u1e6dn\u0101 \u091a\u093e\u091f\u0928\u093e (to lick, as in licking one's fingers while eating), from Prakrit ca\u1e6d\u1e6dei \u091a\u091f\u094d\u091f\u0947\u0907 (to devour with relish, eat noisily).[4] The chaat variants are all based on fried dough, with various other ingredients. The original chaat is a mixture of potato pieces, crisp fried bread, dahi vada or dahi bhalla, gram or chickpeas and tangy-salty spices, with sour Indian chili and saunth (dried ginger and tamarind sauce), fresh green coriander leaves and yogurt for garnish, but other popular variants included alu tikkis or samosa (garnished with onion, potatoes, coriander, peas, hot spices and a dash of yogurt), bhel puri, dahi puri, panipuri, dahi vada, papri chaat, and sev puri. There are common elements among these variants including dahi (yogurt); chopped onions and coriander; sev (thin dried yellow salty noodles); and chaat masala, typically consisting of amchoor (dried mango powder), cumin, kala namak (Himalayan black rock salt), coriander, dried ginger, salt, black pepper, and red pepper. The ingredients are combined and served on a small metal plate or a banana leaf, dried and formed into a bowl. Some of the dishes now categorized as chaats, such as Dahi Vada, can be traced back to ancient periods. A recipe for a dahi vada analogue called kshiravata is mentioned in Manasollasa, a 12th-century Sanskrit encyclopedia compiled by Someshvara III, who ruled from present-day Karnataka.[5][6] According to food historian K.T Achaya, descriptions of dahi vada also appear in literature far earlier from 500\u00a0BC.[7] Another dish resembling as chaat as an organized phenomenon or distinct group of dishes, according to culinary anthropologist Kurush Dalal, originated in northern India (now Uttar Pradesh) in the late 17th century during the reign of Mughal Emperor Shah Jahan. The royal doctors had asked the people of Delhi to consume spicy and fried snacks, as well as dahi, as a countermeasure to the alkaline water of the Yamuna river that coursed through the city.[8] Most chaats originated in some parts of Uttar Pradesh in India later in 20th century,[9] but they are now eaten all across South Asia and neighboring countries. Some are results of cultural syncretism. Chaat is famous in South Asia in India, Pakistan, Nepal and Bangladesh.", "Gushtaba": "Wazwan (Kashmiri pronunciation: [wa\u02d0z\u0268wa\u02d0n]) is a multi-course meal in Kashmiri cuisine, originating from Kashmir. Almost all the dishes are meat-based using lamb, chicken or mutton  with few vegetarian dishes. It is popular throughout the larger Kashmir region. Moreover, Wazwan is also served internationally at Kashmiri food festivals and reunions.[1] In the Kashmiri language, waz means 'cook' or 'cooking' and wan means 'shop'. The ultimate formal banquet in Kashmir is the royal wazwan. Of its thirty-six courses, between fifteen and thirty can be preparations of meat, cooked overnight under the supervision of a master chef called a wouste waze. Guests are seated in groups of four and share the meal out of a large copper plate called the traem. A ritual washing of hands in a portable basin called the Tash-t-naer, which is taken around by attendants. Then the traem arrives, heaped with rice, quartered by two seekh kababs and contains four pieces of methi maaz, (mutton intestines flavored with a spice mixture containing dried fenugreek (methi) leaves), two tabakh maaz (twice-cooked lamb ribs, initially braised with ground spices, then browned in ghee), one safed kokur (chicken with white sauce), one zafran kokur (chicken with saffron sauce), and the first few courses. Yogurt and chutney are served separately in small earthen pots. Up to about 20 items are served thereafter by waza (the junior cook). Seven dishes are a must for these occasions \u2014 tabakh maaz, rista (meatballs in a red, paprika-saffron-fennel spice gravy colored with dyer's alkanet), rogan josh, daniwal korma (lamb roasted with yoghurt, spices and onion puree, topped with coriander leaves), aab gosh (lamb chunks cooked with a fennel-based spice mixture, cardamom and partially evaporated milk), marchhwangan korma (chicken legs/thighs cooked in a spicy browned-onion sauce) and gushtaba (meatballs cooked in a spicy yoghurt gravy).[2][3] The main course usually ends with gushtaba.[4] The gushtaba is a large meatball which signals the end of the main course. After that, desserts are served. In winters, the dessert can be a hot sweet dish and in summers, it is usually something cold. http://kashmironline.net/category/food/wazwan/", "Lamb Saag": "Saag (Hindustani: [\u02c8s\u0251\u02d0g]), also spelled sag or saga, is an Indian subcontinental leafy vegetable dish eaten with bread, such as roti or naan,[1][2] or in some regions with rice. Saag can be made from mustard greens, collard greens, basella or finely chopped broccoli along with added spices and sometimes other ingredients, such as chhena. In India, it is common, especially in the state of Odisha, where it is eaten with pakhala. In the Shree Jagannath Temple of Puri, saag is one of the dishes offered to Jagannath as part of Mahaprasad. Saag is also common in West Bengal and other regions of North India, where the most common preparation is sarson ka saag (mustard plant leaves), which may be eaten with makki ki roti, a yellow roti made with maize flour.[3] Saag gosht or hariyali maans (spinach and mutton) is a common dish in the North Indian state of Punjab.[4] In Pakistan, it is most commonly eaten in the Punjab province along with Makki ki roti and fresh cow butter or Desi ghee. The word saag is derived from the Sanskrit word shaak (\u015b\u0101ka) meaning leafy green vegetables.[5] In Odia cuisine, s\u0101ga (Odia: \u0b36\u0b3e\u0b17) is one of the most important vegetables. It is popular all over the state. A large variety of plants are used as s\u0101ga in Odisha. A list of the plants that are used as s\u0101ga is as below. In Bengali cuisine, s\u0101g is one of the most important vegetables, being popular throughout the state. Most Bengalis eat at least one dish containing s\u0101g at lunchtime every day - usually fried or accompanied by a little gravy (jhol) and served with rice. A list of the plants that are used as s\u0101g is as below. [8] There are around 70 varieties of saag in Jharkhand.[9] Some are as follows: Saags (Leafy greens) are an important part of the Garhwali, Kumaoni and Jaunsari cuisines of Uttarakhand. The abundance of leafy greens in the state is because of fertile land and forested land. Saags of Sarson (Mustard), Palak (spinach), Mooli (Radish) are common[10] but exclusive saags cooked in the state are:", "Pepper Chicken": " Pepper Chicken is an Indian Hindi-language psychological thriller film directed by Ratan Sil Sarma.[1] It stars Dipannita Sharma, Boloram Das, Baharul Islam, Ravi Sarma, and Monuj Borkotoky.[2] The film was released theatrically on 6 November 2020.[3][4] Pepper chicken is a story of a radio jockey who is getting married next day, she starts her journey by a cab leaving her job and the cab journey becomes horrific when they reach to a secluded place.

It is often eaten by itself or as an accompaniment to another dish. Fried rice is a popular component of East Asian, Southeast Asian and certain South Asian cuisines, as well as a staple national dish of Indonesia. As a homemade dish, fried rice is typically made with ingredients left over from other dishes, leading to countless variations. Fried rice first developed during the Sui dynasty in China.[1] Many varieties of fried rice have their own specific list of ingredients. In China, common varieties include Yangzhou fried rice and Hokkien fried rice. Japanese ch\u0101han is considered a Japanese Chinese dish, having derived from Chinese fried rice dishes. In Southeast Asia, similarly constructed Indonesian, Malaysian, and Singaporean nasi goreng and Thai khao phat are popular dishes. In the West, most restaurants catering to vegetarians have invented their own varieties of fried rice, including egg fried rice. Fried rice is also seen on the menus of non-Asian countries restaurants offering cuisines with no native tradition of the dish. Additionally, the cuisine of some Latin American countries includes variations on fried rice, including Ecuadorian chaulafan, Peruvian arroz chaufa, Cuban arroz frito, and Puerto Rican arroz mamposteao. Fried rice is a common street food in Asia and other parts of the world. In some Asian countries, small restaurants, street vendors and traveling hawkers specialise in serving fried rice. In Indonesian cities it is common to find fried rice street vendors moving through the streets with their food cart and stationing it in busy streets or residential areas. Many Southeast Asian street food stands offer fried rice with a selection of optional garnishes and side dishes. Cooked rice is the primary ingredient, with myriad additional ingredients, such as vegetables, eggs, meat (chicken, beef, pork, lamb, mutton), preserved meat (bacon, ham, sausage), seafood (fish, shrimp, crab), mushrooms, among others. Aromatics such as onions, shallots, scallions, leeks, and garlic are often added for extra flavor. Various cooking oils, such as vegetable oil, sesame oil, clarified butter, or lard can be used to grease the wok or frying pan to prevent sticking, as well as for flavor. Fried rice dishes can be seasoned with salt, different types of soy sauce, oyster sauce, teriyaki sauce and many other sauces and spices. Popular garnishes include chopped scallions, sliced chili, fried shallots, sprigs of parsley or coriander leaves, toasted sesame seeds, seaweed flakes (gim or nori), sliced cucumber, tomato, lime, or pickled vegetables. Typically, leftover rice that has been chilled is used rather than freshly cooked rice, as the high moisture content of fresh rice can prevent it from frying properly, leading to an undesirably soft texture. The earliest record of fried rice is in the Sui dynasty (589\u2013618 AD) in China.[2] Fried rice (Thai: \u0e02\u0e49\u0e32\u0e27\u0e1c\u0e31\u0e14, RTGS:\u00a0khao phat, pronounced [k\u02b0\u00e2(\u02d0)w p\u02b0\u00e0t]) in Thailand is typical of central Thai cuisine. In Thai, khao means \"rice\" and phat means \"of or relating to being stir-fried\". This dish differs from Chinese fried rice in that it is prepared with Thai jasmine rice instead of regular long-grain rice. It normally contains meat (chicken, shrimp, pork, and crab are all common), egg, onions, garlic and sometimes tomatoes. The seasonings, which may include soy sauce, sugar, salt, possibly some chili sauce, and the ubiquitous nam pla (fish sauce), are stir-fried together with the other ingredients. The dish is then plated and served with accompaniments like cucumber slices, tomato slices, lime, sprigs of green onion and coriander, and prik nam pla, a spicy sauce made of Thai chili, fish sauce, and chopped garlic. Arroz frito is a denomination used in the Spanish speaking world, meaning \"fried rice\", with adjectives describing the Chinese-inspired varieties, e.g. arroz chino, arroz canton\u00e9s, or local specialties arroz chaufa/chaulaf\u00e1n/chauf\u00e1n/chof\u00e1n, arroz frito tres delicias. An estimated 30,000 people of Chinese origin live in the Dominican Republic. Migration from China began in the second half of the 19th century. Fried rice alongside fried chicken (chicarr\u00f3n de pollo) has been the biggest influence. Dominican fried rice is known as chof\u00e1n. The dish is made with leftover white rice, celery, peppers, onions, carrots, peas, soy sauce and ham, chicken, eggs or shrimp saut\u00e9ed in vegetable oil. Ghanaian fried rice is one of the more contemporary dishes and can be found in almost every Ghanaian restaurant. It is usually made with Jasmine rice, long grain, or basmati rice. The rice is stir-fried with vegetables(carrots, spring onions, peas, green and red bell peppers), eggs, meats of choice(chicken, beef, shrimp), and spices like chili, curry powder, and salt. The sauces mixed with Ghanaian fried rice are usually soy sauce and chicken broth. Nigerian fried rice is made with long-grain rice, diced fried cow liver (optional) or shrimp, protein ( chicken, pork, or shrimp), vegetables (such as carrots, peas, green beans, onions, and chillies), herbs and spices (such as thyme, pepper, and curry powder), and so on. This dish was created by the Yoruba people and spread as a Nigerian staple. Tanzania fried rice is made with long-grain rice, protein (such as beef liver, chicken, or shrimp), vegetables (such as carrots, peas, green beans, onions, and chillies), herbs and spices (such as thyme, pepper, and curry powder), and so on.", "Shawarma": "'Shawarma (/\u0283\u0259\u02c8w\u0251\u02d0rm\u0259/; Arabic: \u0634\u0627\u0648\u0631\u0645\u0627) is a Middle Eastern dish that originated in the Levant region of the Arab world during the Ottoman Empire,[1][2][3][4] consisting of meat that is cut into thin slices, stacked in an inverted cone, and roasted on a slow-turning vertical spit. Traditionally made with lamb or mutton, it may also be made with chicken, turkey, beef, or veal.[5][6][1] The surface of the rotisserie meat is routinely shaved off once it cooks and is ready to be served.[7][8] Shawarma is a popular street food throughout the Arab world and the Greater Middle East.[9][10][11][12] The name sh\u0101warm\u0101 in Arabic is a rendering of the term \u00e7evirme in Ottoman Turkish (\u0686\u064a\u0648\u064a\u0631\u0645\u0649 [t\u0283evi\u027e\u02c8me], lit.\u2009'turning'), referring to rotisserie.[11] Although the roasting of meat on horizontal spits has an ancient history, the shawarma technique\u2014grilling a vertical stack of meat slices and cutting it off as it cooks\u2014first appeared in the Ottoman Empire in the 19th century in the form of d\u00f6ner kebab,[1][13][14] which both the Greek gyros and the Levantine shawarma are derived from.[1][2][15] Shawarma, in turn, led to the development during the early 20th century of the contemporary Mexican dish tacos al pastor when it was brought there by Lebanese immigrants.[2][16] The dish is also especially popular in Ottawa, Ontario, where a large community of the Lebanese diaspora exists.[17] Shawarma is prepared from thin cuts of seasoned and marinated lamb, mutton, veal, beef, chicken, or turkey. The slices are stacked on a skewer about 60\u00a0cm (20\u00a0in) high. Pieces of fat may be added to the stack to provide extra juiciness and flavour. A motorized spit slowly turns the stack of meat in front of an electric or gas-fired heating element, continuously roasting the outer layer. Shavings are cut off the rotating stack for serving, customarily with a long, flat knife.[1] Spices may include cumin, cardamom, cinnamon, turmeric or paprika, and in some areas baharat.[16][3] Shawarma is commonly served as a sandwich or wrap, in a flatbread such as pita, laffa or lavash.[1][18] In the Middle East, chicken shawarma is typically served with garlic sauce, fries, and pickles. The garlic sauce served with the sandwich depends on the meat. Toum or toumie sauce is made from garlic, vegetable oil, lemon, and egg white or starch, and is usually served with chicken shawarma. Tarator sauce is made from garlic, tahini sauce, lemon, and water, and is served with beef shawarma. In Israel, most shawarma is made with dark-meat turkey, commonly served with tahina sauce instead of Yogurt for kashrut reasons.[16] It is often garnished with diced tomatoes, cucumbers, onions, pickled vegetables, hummus, tahina sauce, sumac, or amba mango sauce.[1] Some restaurants offer additional toppings, including grilled peppers, eggplant, or french fries.[19] In Armenia and Georgia, shawarma is traditionally made with thin cuts of marinated meat which is left marinating overnight in spices such as coriander, cumin, cardamom, paprika, garlic, lemon juice, and olive oil.[20] Hot", "Chicken Tandoori": " Tandoori chicken is a dish made from chicken marinated in yogurt and spices and roasted in a tandoor, a cylindrical clay oven. The dish is now popular worldwide. The modern form of the dish was popularized by the Moti Mahal restaurant in New Delhi, India in the late 1940s. Chicken roasted in tandoor-like ovens is documented in the Harappan civilization of the Bronze Age of Indian subcontinent, as early as 3000 BC.[10][11][12][13][14][15] Much later, the Sushruta Samhita records meat being cooked in an oven (kandu) after being seasoned with black mustard (rai) powder and fragrant spices. Tandoori chicken as a dish originated in the Punjab before the independence of partition of India.[16][17] In the late 1940s, tandoori chicken was popularised at Moti Mahal in the locality of Daryaganj[18][19] in New Delhi by Kundan Lal Jaggi, Kundan Lal Gujral and Thakur Das Magu, who were Punjabi Hindu migrants from Peshawar[20][21][22][23][24] as well as the founders of the Moti Mahal restaurant.[1][2][3][4][23] They used to work at a small eatery called Moti Mahal, owned by a man named Mokha Singh Lamba in Peshawar, British India, from the 1920s to 1947.[5][6][25] Tandoori chicken was popularized in post-independence India by Moti Mahal, Daryaganj in Delhi[26][27] when it was served to the first Prime Minister of India, Jawaharlal Nehru.[28] There, tandoori chicken became a standard offering at official banquets.[28] In the United States, tandoori chicken began appearing on menus by the 1960s. Jacqueline Kennedy was reported to have eaten \"chicken tandoori\" on a flight from Rome to Bombay in 1962.[29] A recipe for tandoori chicken was printed in the Los Angeles Times in 1963, for \"the hostess in search of a fresh idea for a party dinner\";[30] a similar recipe was featured in the same newspaper in 1964.[31] Raw chicken parts are skinned then marinated in a mixture of dahi (yogurt) and tandoori masala, a spice blend. They are seasoned and colored with cayenne pepper, red chili powder, or Kashmiri red chili powder as well as turmeric or food coloring.[a] The marinated chicken is placed on skewers and cooked at high temperatures in a tandoor oven, which is heated with charcoal or wood, which adds to the smoky flavour. The dish can also be cooked in a standard oven, using a spit or rotisserie, or over hot charcoal.[32] There are also tandoori recipes for whole chicken, some of which are cooked in a tandoor and others over charcoal. These include Chirga (Roasted whole chicken); Tandoori Murgh (Roast whole chicken with almonds); Murgh Kabab Seekhi (Whole stuffed chicken on the spit); Kookarh Tandoori (Steamed chicken on spit); Tandoori Murgh Massaledarh (Whole spiced chicken on spit); and Murghi Bhogar (Chicken in the Bhogar style).[33] Tandoori chicken can be eaten as a starter or appetizer, or as a main course, often served with naan flatbread.[34] It is also used as the base of numerous cream-based curries, such as butter chicken.[35] The fame of tandoori chicken led to many derivatives, such as chicken tikka (and eventually the Indian dish popularized in Britain, chicken tikka masala), commonly found in menus in Indian restaurants all over the world.[36] Nearly all derivatives of tandoori chicken begin with a yogurt and citrus-based marinade.[37][38]", "Gajar Ka Halwa": " Gajar ka halwa, also known as Gajorer halwa, Gajarno halwo, Gajrela, Gajar pak,[1] and carrot pudding [2][3][4] is a carrot-based sweet dessert pudding made by placing grated carrots in a pot containing a specific amount of water, milk and sugar, cardamom and then cooking while stirring regularly. It is often served with a garnish of almonds and pistachios.[5] The nuts and other items used are first saut\u00e9ed in ghee, a type of clarified butter from the Indian subcontinent.[6] The dessert is traditionally eaten during all of the festivals in the Indian subcontinent, mainly on the occasion of Diwali,[7] Holi, Raksha Bandhan, and Eid.[8] It is served hot during the winter.[9] Gajar ka halwa is a combination of nuts, milk, sugar, khoya and ghee with grated carrots.[10][11] It is a light nutritious dessert with less fat (a minimum of 10.03% and an average of 12.19%) than many other typical sweets from the Indian subcontinent.[12] Gajar ka halwa has a medium shelf life so it is now sometimes exported. At the time of festivals, many people prefer vegetarian dishes as well as desserts in their thali. Because of its low fat content, vegetarian characteristics, ease of making, medium shelf-life and taste, gajar ka halwa is a popular dessert all over India and often served at most festivals. The dish is popular among adults as well as children. In 300 grams of gajar halwa there are 268 calories (76 come from fat, 180 from carbohydrate and 16 from protein).[13] Gajar ka halwa originally contained carrots, milk and ghee but nowadays includes many other ingredients like mava (khoya).[14] The main ingredients of gajar ka halwa are freshly grated carrots, milk, sugar, cardamom, khoya, and ghee. Being a combination of milk and carrots, it is known as milk flavored gajar ka halwa but in the other case, the combination of cream or mava (khoya) and carrot is described as mava flavored gajar ka halwa.[15] For cooking gajar ka halwa, a cooker or kadai is usually preferred. Vasundhara Chauhan, writing for The Hindu, writes that gajar ka halwa should be slow-cooked and that using a pressure cooker spoils the dish.[16] The carrots must be grated before cooking. Red velvet carrot halwa is a variation of the gajar ka halwa. It is made by heating a comparatively large amount of milk cream along with carrots, sugar, rose water and saffron over low flame.[17] Other lesser-known variations include carrot and beetroot halwa, cheese gajar ka halwa, khajur gajar ka halwa and carrot dessert. Cheese gajar ka halwa is prepared with a combination of purple carrots and ricotta. This dish is popular in northern India because purple carrots are mostly grown there.[18] Hot or cold", "Sambhar": "Sambar or Sambhar may refer to:", "Labra": "Labra may refer to:", "Rasmalai": " Ras malai, also known as rasamalei, or roshmalai, is a dessert that invented in Kolkata, British India at 1868 by Krishna Chandra Das.[1] The dessert is called roshmalai in Bengali,[2] ras malai in Hindi,[3] and rasa malei in Odia.[4] It is popular in India, Bangladesh and Pakistan.[5] The original term for ras malai is \"rosho malai (Bengali: \u09b0\u09b8\u09ae\u09be\u09b2\u09be\u0987) which derived from the Classical Bengali word \"rosho malai\" with the same meaning. The term is made with a Bengali word Rosh (Bengali: \u09b0\u09b8) which means sap and a Hindustani word Malai (Hindi: \u092e\u0932\u093e\u0908, Urdu: \u0645\u0644\u0627\u0626\u06cc) which means clotted cream hence the name of the sweet sap of clotted cream.[3] Das Grandsons say that their forefather Krishna Chandra Das invented the ras malai in the early 20th century. His father, Nobin Chandra had come to Calcutta and opened a sweet shop in 1866. He wanted to create an entirely new dish, so he did a lot of experimentation and ended up inventing the rasmalai in 1868. Ras malai consists of flattened balls of chhena soaked in malai (a type of clotted cream) flavoured with cardamom. Milk is boiled and a bit of vinegar or lime juice is added to split it. The whey is discarded and the milk solids are drained, cooled and kneaded into a dough. The dough is divided into small balls and the balls are cooked in hot water with a bit of rose water added. The balls are then cooked in milk with saffron, pistachios and kheer as stuffing.[6] Different types of ras malai also can be found in different areas such Rasmanjuri of Rangpur division. In Dhaka and Rangpur, the ras malais are similar in shape to the rasgullas,[7] and round discs. This Indian cuisine\u2013related article is a stub. You can help Wikipedia by expanding it.

Cold", "Falooda": " Nam maenglak\nAlouda A falooda is a Mughalai cold dessert made with vermicelli.[1][2] It has origins in the Persian dish faloodeh, variants of which are found across West, Central, South and Southeast Asia.[3] Traditionally it is made by mixing rose syrup, vermicelli, and sweet basil seeds with milk, often served with ice cream.[4] The vermicelli used for preparing falooda is made from wheat,[5] arrowroot, cornstarch, or sago.[6] The origin of falooda goes back to Iran (Persia), where a similar dessert, faloodeh, is still popular.[7] The dessert came to late Medieval India with the many Central Asian dynasties that invaded and settled in South Asia in the 16th to 18th century.[7] The present form of falooda was developed in the Mughal Empire and spread with its conquests. The Persianate rulers who succeeded from the Mughals patronized the dessert with their own adaptations, specifically in Hyderabad Deccan and the Carnatic areas of present-day India.[2] This beverage is now a part of Pakistani cuisine, Afghan cuisine, Burmese cuisine, Indian cuisine, Bangladeshi cuisine and Sri Lankan cuisine and is served on weddings and other occasions. In Sri Lanka, Falooda (\u0dc6\u0dbd\u0dd4\u0da9\u0dcf / \u0b83\u0baa\u0bb2\u0bc2\u0b9f\u0bbe) is often consumed as a popular dairy refereshment. In idiomatic Hindustani, faluda is sometimes used as a reference to something that has been shredded, which is an allusion to the vermicelli noodles. For example, someone who falls into disrepute might say that his or her izzat has been turned to faluda (Hindi: \u0907\u091c\u093c\u094d\u091c\u093c\u0924 \u0915\u093e \u092b\u093c\u093e\u0932\u0942\u0926\u093e, Urdu: \u0639\u0632\u062a \u06a9\u0627 \u0641\u0627\u0644\u0648\u062f\u06c1, romanized:\u00a0izzat ka faluda), which is roughly equivalent to saying \"my reputation is shot\".[8] Cold", "Gulab Jamun": " Gulab jamun (also spelled gulaab jamun; lit.\u2009'Rose water berry' or 'Rose berry') is a sweet confectionary or dessert, originating in the Indian subcontinent and a type of mithai popular in India, Pakistan, Nepal, the Maldives and Bangladesh, as well as Myanmar. It is also common in nations with substantial populations of people with South Asian heritage, such as Mauritius, Fiji, Gulf states, the Malay Peninsula, Great Britain, South Africa, and the Caribbean countries of Jamaica, Trinidad and Tobago, Guyana, and Suriname. It is made mainly from milk solids, traditionally from khoya, which is milk reduced to the consistency of a soft dough. Modern recipes call for dried or powdered milk instead of khoya. It is often garnished with dried nuts, such as almonds and cashews, to enhance flavour. In the Indian subcontinent, milk and cheese solids are prepared by heating milk over a low flame until the water content has evaporated and only the milk solids, known as khoya, remain. The solids are kneaded with flour (maida), and small balls of this dough are deep-fried in oil or ghee (clarified butter) at a low temperature,[1] then soaked in a light sugar syrup flavored with green cardamom and rose water, kewra or saffron.[2] Hot gulab jamun is often served with vanilla ice cream, or kulfi. According to culinary historian Michael Krondl, 12th century Manasollasa mentions a recipe for fried fritter balls made of chenna cheese and rice flour and was soaked in cardamom-scented syrup, but this recipe did not use rosewater (gulab) syrup.[3][4] The 13th century Arab dessert luqmat al-qadi is similar in appearance to gulab jamun, although it is made of entirely different batter than gulab jamun but was soaked in rosewater-scented (gulab) syrup, the only Persian connection may be the common use of rosewater syrup.[5] Gulab Jamun emerged in medieval India during the Islamic period, blending Persianate influence with local influences that eventually became gulab jamun.[6]  The word \"gulab\" is derived from the Persian words gul (flower) and \u0101b (water), referring to the rose water-scented syrup, and \"Jamun\" or \"jaman\" is the Hindi word for Syzygium jambolanum, an Indian fruit with a similar size and shape, commonly known as black plum.[7] Jamun is also defined as a fried delicacy in sugar syrup.[8] Gulab jamun is often eaten at festivals, birthdays or major celebrations such as marriages, the Muslim celebrations of Eid ul-Fitr and Eid al-Adha, and the Hindu festivals of Diwali and Ganesh Chaturthi. There are various types of gulab jamun. Gulab jamun gets its brownish red colour because of the sugar content in the milk powder (khoya). In other types of gulab jamun, sugar is added in the batter, and after frying, the sugar caramelization gives it its dark, almost black colour, which is then called kala jamun or \"black jamun\". The sugar syrup may be replaced with (slightly) diluted maple syrup for a gulab jamun. Homemade gulab jamun is usually made up of khoya, a pinch of all-purpose flour/refined wheat flour/ wheat flour (optional), baking powder and clarified butter (ghee); milk kneaded to form a dough, moulded into balls, deep fried and dropped into simmering sugar syrup. In Bengali, Gulab Jamun is known as Kalo Jam or Pantua, which is similar to gulab jamun, and could be called a Bengali variant of that dish.[9] Ledikeni, a variation of Pantua, is another variant of gulab jamun.[10] It is said[by whom?] to have been invented by Bhim Chandra Nag on the occasion of a visit by Lady Canning, the wife of Charles Canning, the Governor-General of India during 1856\u201362. Katangi, a town near Jabalpur is famous for \"Jhurre Ka Rasgulla\", which has been made there for the past 100 years.[11][12] It is several times the size of normal gulab jamuns and is prepared in local desi ghee.[13] In Rajasthan, instead of soaking gulab jamun balls in sugar syrup, they are cooked in gravy made from spices, nuts and tomato to make popular Gulab Jamun ki Sabzi. In Western Madhya Pradesh and Malwa, Mawa Bati is populer as local version of Gulab Jamun. It is different than Gulab jamun by size, fillings and amount of sweetness, Mawa bati is usually not immersed in Sugar syrup and slightly larger than Gulab Jamun.[14] In Bangladesh, Pantua is available almost everywhere throughout the country, which can be referred to a Bengali variation of Gulab jamun. Also there are two kinds of jamuns that are famous. They are Golap Jam (\u0997\u09cb\u09b2\u09be\u09aa \u099c\u09be\u09ae) and Kalo Jam (\u0995\u09be\u09b2\u09cb \u099c\u09be\u09ae). The sweet is known as Lal Mohan (\u0932\u093e\u0932\u092e\u094b\u0939\u0928) in Nepali language and is available at almost every sweet shop. The sale of the sweet usually increases significantly during festivals such as Tihar, Dashain, etc.[15] Hot, cold or at room temperature", "Keema": "Ground meat, called mince or minced meat outside North America, is meat finely chopped by a meat grinder or a chopping knife. A common type of ground meat is ground beef, but many other types of meats are prepared in a similar fashion, including pork, veal, lamb, goat meat, and poultry. Ground meat is used in a wide variety of dishes, by itself, or mixed with other ingredients. It may be formed into meatballs which are then fried, baked, steamed, or braised. They may be cooked on a skewer to produce dishes such as adana kebab\u0131 and \u0107evapi. It may be formed into patties which are then grilled or fried (hamburger), breaded and fried (menchi-katsu, Pozharsky cutlet), or braised (Salisbury steak). It may be formed into meatloaves or p\u00e2t\u00e9s and baked. It may also be used as a filling or stuffing for meat pies such as Shepherd's pie and b\u00f6reks, and also as stuffing. It may be cooked and served as a hash or loosemeat. It may be made into meat sauce such as rag\u00f9, which in turn is used in dishes like pastitsio and moussaka, or mixed with sauce and served on a bun as a sloppy joe sandwich. It may also be cooked with beans, tomatoes, and/or spices to make chili con carne. In the Indian subcontinent, minced meat is used in a variety of dishes such as a stewed or fried curry dish of minced beef, mutton (i.e., goat meat or chevon) or other kinds of meat with green peas or potatoes. It usually includes ghee/butter, onions, garlic, ginger, chilis, and spices. Minced meat is called keema or qeema in the Indian subcontinent.[1] Keema can be grilled on a skewer and is then called seekh kebab, or it is used as a filling for samosas or naan. The word ultimately comes from the Turkic word q\u0131yma meaning 'minced meat', and is thus related to the Persian qeyme, Turkish k\u0131yma, and Greek kim\u00e1s.[2][3] Ground meat has food safety concerns very different from whole cuts of meat. If undercooked, it can lead to food poisoning.[4] In a whole cut from an animal, the interior of the meat is essentially sterile, even before cooking; any bacterial contamination is on the outer surface of the meat. This is why, for example, it is typically safe for humans to consume steak that is cooked \"rare\" in such a way that the interior of the cut remains red in colour - the searing of the exterior of the meat is enough to kill any bacteria on the surface. However, when meat is ground, bacterial contamination from the surface can be distributed throughout the meat. If ground beef is not well cooked all the way through, there is a significant chance that enough pathogenic bacteria will survive to cause illness. Moreover, the warming will speed the reproduction of bacteria.[5][6] Undercooked Jack in the Box hamburgers contaminated in this manner were responsible for four deaths and the illness of hundreds of people in 1993.[7] To ensure the safety of ground meat distributed through the National School Lunch Program, food banks, federal food and nutrition programs, the United States Department of Agriculture has established food safety and quality requirements for the ground beef that it purchases. A 2010 United States National Research Council report reviewed the scientific basis of the Department's ground beef safety standards, evaluated how the standards compare to those used by large retail and commercial food service purchasers of ground beef, and looked at ways to establish periodic evaluations of the Federal Purchase Ground Beef Program.[8] The report found that although the safety requirements could be strengthened using scientific concepts, the prevention of future outbreaks of food-borne disease will depend on eliminating contamination during production and ensuring meat is properly cooked before it is served.[9]", "Korma": "Korma or qorma (Urdu: \u0642\u0648\u0631\u0645\u06c1; Hindi: \u0915\u093c\u094b\u0930\u092e\u093e; Bengali: \u0995\u09cb\u09b0\u09ae\u09be); Persian: \u0642\u0631\u0645\u0627); is a dish with its origin in the Indian subcontinent,[1] consisting of meat or vegetables braised with yogurt, water or stock, and spices to produce a thick sauce or gravy.[2] The English name is an anglicisation of the Hindi-Urdu qorm\u0101 (\u0915\u093c\u094b\u0930\u092e\u093e, \u0642\u0648\u0631\u0645\u06c1), meaning \"braise\".[3][4] It refers to the cooking technique used in the dish.[2][5] All these words, and the names of dishes such as the Iranian ghormeh (Persian: \u0642\u0648\u0631\u0645\u0647), Turkish Kavurma and the Azerbaijani qovurma or kavarma, are ultimately derived from a Turkic word qawirma, meaning \"[a] fried thing\".[4] The Indian korma is, however, possibly unrelated in a culinary sense to the modern Turkish kavurma or to some other dishes using the same root word, as they use widely varying techniques and ingredients.[6] Korma has its roots in the Mughlai cuisine[1] of the Indian subcontinent. A characteristic Mughal dish, it can be traced back to the 16th century and to the Mughal expansion into South Asia. Kormas were often prepared in the Mughal court kitchens, such as the famous white korma, perhaps garnished with vark, was said to have been served to Shah Jahan and his guests at the inauguration of the Taj Mahal.[7] Classically, a korma is defined as a dish where meat or vegetables are braised with yogurt or stock. The technique covers many different styles of korma. The flavour of a korma is based on the mixture of spices, including ground coriander and cumin, combined with yogurt kept below curdling temperature and incorporated slowly and carefully with the meat juices. Traditionally, this would have been carried out in a pot set over a very low fire, with charcoal on the lid to provide all-round heat. A korma can be mildly spiced or fiery and may use lamb, goat meat, chicken, beef or game; some kormas combine meat and vegetables, such as spinach and turnip. The term shahi (English: royal), used for some kormas, indicates its status as a prestige dish, rather than an everyday meal, and its association with the court. The korma style is similar to other braising techniques in that the meat or vegetable is first cooked briskly, or seared, using high heat, traditionally with ghee, and then subjected to long, slow cooking using moist heat and a minimum of added liquid.[2] The pot may be sealed with dough during the last stages of cooking, using a technique called dum or dampokhtak.[2] The korma is made using a technique called bagar. in the later stage of cooking, additional spices are mixed with heated ghee and then combined with the sauce formed by the braising. The pan is then covered and shaken to release steam and mix the contents.[8] There is a wide variation between individual korma and other \"curry\" recipes. Chilli and ginger are often used, but the precise method of preparation results in widely different flavors. Indian bay leaves or dried coconut may be added, the latter being a predominantly South Indian flavoring. A korma pilau (pilaf) is a rice and meat dish made with braised meat.[9] In the United Kingdom, a typical korma as served in curry houses is a mildly spiced dish with a thick sauce. It often features almonds, cashews or other nuts, and coconut or coconut milk. In the 21st century, chicken korma has several times been cited as the most popular curry in the UK, replacing chicken tikka masala in surveys of public eating habits.[10][11] Navratan korma is a vegetarian korma made with vegetables and either paneer (an Indian cheese) or nuts \u2013 or sometimes both.[12] Navratan means \"nine gems\", and it is common for the recipe to include nine different vegetables. In some parts of South Asia, korma is used to denote a traditional Eid al-Adha (festival of the sacrifice) dish of lamb, goat, or cow that is braised in minimal or no spices. The flavour comes from the meat and fat of the chosen cuts. It was often done to preserve meats for a short-term period, as the fat layer forms a barrier to help prevent spoilage, similar to potted beef. In Malaysia, korma or 'gulai kurma' is traditionally cooked with coconut milk instead of yoghurt among the Malays, as dairy products do not feature heavily in Malay cuisine. Meats used for kurma include chicken, mutton, beef, and deer. It also often contains more vegetables, such as carrots, potatoes, and tomatoes, though this is not a hard-and-fast rule. Some recipes include tamarind as the souring agent, in place of the natural acidity of yoghurt.[13]", "Rogan Josh": "Rogan josh (English: /\u02ccro\u028a\u0261\u0259n \u02c8d\u0292o\u028a\u0283/;[1] Kashmiri: [ro\u02d0\u0261an d\u0292o\u02d0\u0283]), also spelled roghan josh or roghan ghosht, is an aromatic curried meat dish originating from Kashmir.[2] It is made with red meat\u2014traditionally lamb, mutton, or goat\u2014and coloured and flavoured primarily by alkanet flower (or root) and Kashmiri chilies. It is one of the signature recipes of Kashmiri cuisine. A number of origins of the name have been suggested. Rawghan means \"clarified butter\"[3] or \"oil\" in Persian, while j\u014d\u0161 means to \"stew\" or \"braise\"[4] and ultimately derives from the verb j\u014d\u0161\u012bdan meaning \"to boil\". Rogan josh, by this definition, may mean \"stewed in ghee\".[4] An alternative etymology is that the name derives from either the word roghan (Hindi: \u0930\u094b\u0917\u0928, Urdu: \u0631\u0648\u063a\u0646), \"brown\" or \"red\",[2] or the Koshur roghan, \"red\",[5] along with the word either for \"meat\", (go\u0161t) often romanized as \"rogan ghosht\" or \"gosht\",[6] or a word meaning \"juice\", giving possible meanings of \"red meat\" or \"red juice\".[7] The exact etymology remains uncertain as both \"rogan josh\" and \"rogan ghosht\" are used to refer to the dish and it is unclear which of the names is the original.[6] Rogan josh is a staple of Kashmiri cuisine and is one of the main dishes of the Kashmiri multicourse meal (the wazwan). The dish was originally brought to Kashmir by the Mughals, whose cuisine was, in turn, influenced by Persian cuisine. The unrelenting summer heat of the central Indian plains took the Mughals frequently to the country's northern region, Kashmir, which has a cooler climate because of its elevation and latitude.[3] Rogan josh consists of pieces of lamb or mutton braised with a gravy flavoured with garlic, ginger and aromatic spices (clove, bay leaves, cardamom, and cinnamon), and in some versions incorporating onions or yoghurt.[8] After initial braising, the dish may be finished using the dampokhtak slow cooking technique.[9] Its characteristic deep red colour traditionally comes from dried flowers or root of Alkanna tinctoria (ratan jot)[7] and from liberal amounts of dried, deseeded Kashmiri chillies (lal mirch). These chillies, whose flavour approximates that of paprika, are considerably milder than the typical dried chillies used in Indian cuisine, whose flavor and heat level are similar to cayenne pepper. The recipe's spice emphasises aroma rather than heat. Saffron is also part of some traditional recipes. There are different approaches in preparation: Some use praan, a local form of shallot, and petals of maval, the cockscomb flower, for colouring (and for its supposed \"cooling\" effect);[8] others may add yoghurt and asafoetida to give additional body and flavor.[8] While the traditional preparation uses whole dried chilies that are de-seeded, soaked in water, and ground to a paste, non-traditional shortcuts use either Kashmiri chili powder (available in Indian stores) or a mixture of paprika (predominantly) and cayenne pepper, adjusted to taste. (Madhur Jaffrey's recipe[10] calls for a 4:1 ratio of paprika to cayenne.) An updated version served in Sanjeev Kapoor's restaurants uses white and black cardamom, anise, and bay leaves.[11] Many western interpretations of the dish add tomatoes to the sauce. This is especially common with ready-made pour-over cooking sauces to the point where the dish may be considered tomato-based. The authenticity of including tomatoes is disputed: some authors state that tomatoes are not part of the traditional dish or of traditional Indian cuisine and should not be included.[12] However, other authors have specifically referred to rogan josh as a dish based around meat and tomatoes,[13] while others have identified tomatoes with a Punjabi version of the dish as opposed to a Kashmiri one.[14] There is a variety with beef as well, brisket being preferred.[15] Hot", "Kadai Paneer": "Kadai Paneer[1][2][3][4] (or known as Kadhai Paneer) is an Indian dish made by cooking paneer and bell peppers in a fragrant, freshly ground spice powder. It is usually served with buttered naan, paratha, roti, jeera rice, or steamed basmati rice. It is of two types:", "Palak Paneer": " Palak paneer (pronounced [pa\u02d0l\u0259k p\u0259ni\u02d0\u027e]) or palak chhena[1] is an Indian dish[2] consisting of chhena[3] or paneer in a thick paste made from pur\u00e9ed spinach, called palak in Hindi, Marathi, Gujarati, and other Indian languages.[4][5][6] The terms palak chhena and saag chhena are sometimes used interchangeably in restaurants in the Anglosphere. However, saag chhena is different from traditional palak chhena in that it contains other green leafy vegetables, such as mustard greens, whereas palak paneer only contains spinach.[7][8][9] Dhaba restaurants often specialize in palak chhena. Palak paneer is prepared by first boiling and pureeing spinach. The puree is then mixed with saut\u00e9ed tomatoes and onions. Grilled cubes of paneer are then added to the puree. Palak paneer is typically spiced with ginger, garlic, tomatoes, garam masala, turmeric, chili powder and cumin.[10][9][11][12] Palak paneer is served hot with a side dish such as roti, naan, parathas, makki ki roti, or boiled rice. It can also be served with onions on the side for a more traditional approach. In recent years, there have been fusion variations of palak paneer. In July 2020, a Bangalore-based food blogger posted her variation of palak paneer idli. The dish sparked conversation on Twitter and Instagram about the unusual combination of these two North and South Indian dishes.[13][14] Food portal  This Indian cuisine\u2013related article is a stub.

Hot", "Mushroom Curry": " A mushroom or toadstool is the fleshy, spore-bearing fruiting body of a fungus, typically produced above ground, on soil, or on its food source. Toadstool generally denotes one poisonous to humans.[1] The standard for the name \"mushroom\" is the cultivated white button mushroom, Agaricus bisporus; hence, the word \"mushroom\" is most often applied to those fungi (Basidiomycota, Agaricomycetes) that have a stem (stipe), a cap (pileus), and gills (lamellae, sing. lamella) on the underside of the cap. \"Mushroom\" also describes a variety of other gilled fungi, with or without stems; therefore the term is used to describe the fleshy fruiting bodies of some Ascomycota. The gills produce microscopic spores which help the fungus spread across the ground or its occupant surface. Forms deviating from the standard morphology usually have more specific names, such as \"bolete\", \"puffball\", \"stinkhorn\", and \"morel\", and gilled mushrooms themselves are often called \"agarics\" in reference to their similarity to Agaricus or their order Agaricales. By extension, the term \"mushroom\" can also refer to either the entire fungus when in culture, the thallus (called mycelium) of species forming the fruiting bodies called mushrooms, or the species itself. The terms \"mushroom\" and \"toadstool\" go back centuries and were never precisely defined, nor was there consensus on application. During the 15th and 16th centuries, the terms mushrom, mushrum, muscheron, mousheroms, mussheron, or musserouns were used.[3] The term \"mushroom\" and its variations may have been derived from the French word mousseron in reference to moss (mousse). Delineation between edible and poisonous fungi is not clear-cut, so a \"mushroom\" may be edible, poisonous, or unpalatable.[4][5] The word toadstool appeared first in 14th century England as a reference for a \"stool\" for toads, possibly implying an inedible poisonous fungus.[6] Identifying what is and is not a mushroom requires a basic understanding of their macroscopic structure. Most are basidiomycetes and gilled. Their spores, called basidiospores, are produced on the gills and fall in a fine rain of powder from under the caps as a result. At the microscopic level, the basidiospores are shot off basidia and then fall between the gills in the dead air space. As a result, for most mushrooms, if the cap is cut off and placed gill-side-down overnight, a powdery impression reflecting the shape of the gills (or pores, or spines, etc.) is formed (when the fruit body is sporulating). The color of the powdery print, called a spore print, is useful in both classifying and identifying mushrooms. Spore print colors include white (most common), brown, black, purple-brown, pink, yellow, and creamy, but almost never blue, green, or red.[7] While modern identification of mushrooms is quickly becoming molecular, the standard methods for identification are still used by most and have developed into a fine art harking back to medieval times and the Victorian era, combined with microscopic examination. The presence of juices upon breaking, bruising-reactions, odors, tastes, shades of color, habitat, habit, and season are all considered by both amateur and professional mycologists. Tasting and smelling mushrooms carries its own hazards because of poisons and allergens. Chemical tests are also used for some genera.[8] In general, identification to genus can often be accomplished in the field using a local field guide. Identification to species, however, requires more effort. A mushroom develops from a button stage into a mature structure, and only the latter can provide certain characteristics needed for the identification of the species. However, over-mature specimens lose features and cease producing spores. Many novices have mistaken humid water marks on paper for white spore prints, or discolored paper from oozing liquids on lamella edges for colored spored prints. Typical mushrooms are the fruit bodies of members of the order Agaricales, whose type genus is Agaricus and type species is the field mushroom, Agaricus campestris. However in modern molecularly defined classifications, not all members of the order Agaricales produce mushroom fruit bodies, and many other gilled fungi, collectively called mushrooms, occur in other orders of the class Agaricomycetes. For example, chanterelles are in the Cantharellales, false chanterelles such as Gomphus are in the Gomphales, milk-cap mushrooms (Lactarius, Lactifluus) and russulas (Russula), as well as Lentinellus, are in the Russulales, while the tough, leathery genera Lentinus and Panus are among the Polyporales, but Neolentinus is in the Gloeophyllales, and the little pin-mushroom genus, Rickenella, along with similar genera, are in the Hymenochaetales. Within the main body of mushrooms, in the Agaricales, are common fungi like the common fairy-ring mushroom, shiitake, enoki, oyster mushrooms, fly agarics and other Amanitas, magic mushrooms like species of Psilocybe, paddy straw mushrooms, shaggy manes, etc. An atypical mushroom is the lobster mushroom, which is a fruitbody of a Russula or Lactarius mushroom that has been deformed by the parasitic fungus Hypomyces lactifluorum. This gives the affected mushroom an unusual shape and red color that resembles that of a boiled lobster.[9] Other mushrooms are not gilled, so the term \"mushroom\" is loosely used, and giving a full account of their classifications is difficult. Some have pores underneath (and are usually called boletes), others have spines, such as the hedgehog mushroom and other tooth fungi, and so on. \"Mushroom\" has been used for polypores, puffballs, jelly fungi, coral fungi, bracket fungi, stinkhorns, and cup fungi. Thus, the term is more one of common application to macroscopic fungal fruiting bodies than one having precise taxonomic meaning. Approximately 14,000 species of mushrooms are described.[10] A mushroom develops from a nodule, or pinhead, less than two millimeters in diameter, called a primordium, which is typically found on or near the surface of the substrate. It is formed within the mycelium, the mass of threadlike hyphae that make up the fungus. The primordium enlarges into a roundish structure of interwoven hyphae roughly resembling an egg, called a \"button\". The button has a cottony roll of mycelium, the universal veil, that surrounds the developing fruit body. As the egg expands, the universal veil ruptures and may remain as a cup, or volva, at the base of the stalk, or as warts or volval patches on the cap. Many mushrooms lack a universal veil, therefore they do not have either a volva or volval patches. Often, a second layer of tissue, the partial veil, covers the bladelike gills that bear spores. As the cap expands the veil breaks, and remnants of the partial veil may remain as a ring, or annulus, around the middle of the stalk or as fragments hanging from the margin of the cap. The ring may be skirt-like as in some species of Amanita, collar-like as in many species of Lepiota, or merely the faint remnants of a cortina (a partial veil composed of filaments resembling a spiderweb), which is typical of the genus Cortinarius. Mushrooms lacking partial veils do not form an annulus.[11] The stalk (also called the stipe, or stem) may be central and support the cap in the middle, or it may be off-center or lateral, as in species of Pleurotus and Panus. In other mushrooms, a stalk may be absent, as in the polypores that form shelf-like brackets. Puffballs lack a stalk, but may have a supporting base. Other mushrooms including truffles, jellies, earthstars, and bird's nests usually do not have stalks, and a specialized mycological vocabulary exists to describe their parts. The way the gills attach to the top of the stalk is an important feature of mushroom morphology. Mushrooms in the genera Agaricus, Amanita, Lepiota and Pluteus, among others, have free gills that do not extend to the top of the stalk. Others have decurrent gills that extend down the stalk, as in the genera Omphalotus and Pleurotus. There are a great number of variations between the extremes of free and decurrent, collectively called attached gills. Finer distinctions are often made to distinguish the types of attached gills: adnate gills, which adjoin squarely to the stalk; notched gills, which are notched where they join the top of the stalk; adnexed gills, which curve upward to meet the stalk, and so on. These distinctions between attached gills are sometimes difficult to interpret, since gill attachment may change as the mushroom matures, or with different environmental conditions.[12] A hymenium is a layer of microscopic spore-bearing cells that covers the surface of gills. In the nongilled mushrooms, the hymenium lines the inner surfaces of the tubes of boletes and polypores, or covers the teeth of spine fungi and the branches of corals. In the Ascomycota, spores develop within microscopic elongated, sac-like cells called asci, which typically contain eight spores in each ascus. The Discomycetes, which contain the cup, sponge, brain, and some club-like fungi, develop an exposed layer of asci, as on the inner surfaces of cup fungi or within the pits of morels. The Pyrenomycetes, tiny dark-colored fungi that live on a wide range of substrates including soil, dung, leaf litter, and decaying wood, as well as other fungi, produce minute, flask-shaped structures called perithecia, within which the asci develop.[13] In the basidiomycetes, usually four spores develop on the tips of thin projections called sterigmata, which extend from club-shaped cells called a basidia. The fertile portion of the Gasteromycetes, called a gleba, may become powdery as in the puffballs or slimy as in the stinkhorns. Interspersed among the asci are threadlike sterile cells called paraphyses. Similar structures called cystidia often occur within the hymenium of the Basidiomycota. Many types of cystidia exist, and assessing their presence, shape, and size is often used to verify the identification of a mushroom.[13] The most important microscopic feature for identification of mushrooms is the spores. Their color, shape, size, attachment, ornamentation, and reaction to chemical tests often can be the crux of an identification. A spore often has a protrusion at one end, called an apiculus, which is the point of attachment to the basidium, termed the apical germ pore, from which the hypha emerges when the spore germinates.[13] Many species of mushrooms seemingly appear overnight, growing or expanding rapidly. This phenomenon is the source of several common expressions in the English language including \"to mushroom\" or \"mushrooming\" (expanding rapidly in size or scope) and \"to pop up like a mushroom\" (to appear unexpectedly and quickly). In reality, all species of mushrooms take several days to form primordial mushroom fruit bodies, though they do expand rapidly by the absorption of fluids.[14][15][16][17] The cultivated mushroom, as well as the common field mushroom, initially form a minute fruiting body, referred to as the pin stage because of their small size. Slightly expanded, they are called buttons, once again because of the relative size and shape. Once such stages are formed, the mushroom can rapidly pull in water from its mycelium and expand, mainly by inflating preformed cells that took several days to form in the primordia.[18] Similarly, there are other mushrooms, like Parasola plicatilis (formerly Coprinus plicatlis), that grow rapidly overnight and may disappear by late afternoon on a hot day after rainfall.[19] The primordia form at ground level in lawns in humid spaces under the thatch and after heavy rainfall or in dewy conditions balloon to full size in a few hours, release spores, and then collapse.[20][21] Not all mushrooms expand overnight; some grow very slowly and add tissue to their fruiting bodies by growing from the edges of the colony or by inserting hyphae. For example, Pleurotus nebrodensis grows slowly, and because of this combined with human collection, it is now critically endangered.[22] Though mushroom fruiting bodies are short-lived, the underlying mycelium can itself be long-lived and massive. A colony of Armillaria solidipes (formerly known as Armillaria ostoyae) in Malheur National Forest in the United States is estimated to be 2,400 years old, possibly older, and spans an estimated 2,200 acres (8.9\u00a0km2).[23] Most of the fungus is underground and in decaying wood or dying tree roots in the form of white mycelia combined with black shoelace-like rhizomorphs that bridge colonized separated woody substrates.[24] Raw brown mushrooms are 92% water, 4% carbohydrates, 2% protein and less than 1% fat. In a 100 grams (3.5 ounces) amount, raw mushrooms provide 22 calories and are a rich source (20% or more of the Daily Value, DV) of B vitamins, such as riboflavin, niacin and pantothenic acid, selenium (37% DV) and copper (25% DV), and a moderate source (10-19% DV) of phosphorus, zinc and potassium (table). They have minimal or no vitamin C and sodium content. The vitamin D content of a mushroom depends on postharvest handling, in particular the unintended exposure to sunlight. The US Department of Agriculture provided evidence that UV-exposed mushrooms contain substantial amounts of vitamin D.[27] When exposed to ultraviolet (UV) light, even after harvesting,[28] ergosterol in mushrooms is converted to vitamin D2,[29] a process now used intentionally to supply fresh vitamin D mushrooms for the functional food grocery market.[30][31] In a comprehensive safety assessment of producing vitamin D in fresh mushrooms, researchers showed that artificial UV light technologies were equally effective for vitamin D production as in mushrooms exposed to natural sunlight, and that UV light has a long record of safe use for production of vitamin D in food.[30] Mushrooms are used extensively in cooking, in many cuisines (notably Chinese, Korean, European, and Japanese). Humans have valued them as food since antiquity.[32] Most mushrooms sold in supermarkets have been commercially grown on mushroom farms. The most common of these, Agaricus bisporus, is considered safe for most people to eat because it is grown in controlled, sterilized environments. Several varieties of A.\u00a0bisporus are grown commercially, including whites, crimini, and portobello. Other cultivated species available at many grocers include Hericium erinaceus, shiitake, maitake (hen-of-the-woods), Pleurotus, and enoki. In recent years, increasing affluence in developing countries has led to a considerable growth in interest in mushroom cultivation, which is now seen as a potentially important economic activity for small farmers.[33] China is a major edible mushroom producer.[34] The country produces about half of all cultivated mushrooms, and around 2.7 kilograms (6.0\u00a0lb) of mushrooms are consumed per person per year by 1.4\u00a0billion people.[35] In 2014, Poland was the world's largest mushroom exporter, reporting an estimated 194,000 tonnes (191,000 long tons; 214,000 short tons) annually.[36] Separating edible from poisonous species requires meticulous attention to detail; there is no single trait by which all toxic mushrooms can be identified, nor one by which all edible mushrooms can be identified. People who collect mushrooms for consumption are known as mycophagists,[37] and the act of collecting them for such is known as mushroom hunting, or simply \"mushrooming\". Even edible mushrooms may produce allergic reactions in susceptible individuals, from a mild asthmatic response to severe anaphylactic shock.[38][39] Even the cultivated A.\u00a0bisporus contains small amounts of hydrazines, the most abundant of which is agaritine (a mycotoxin and carcinogen).[40] However, the hydrazines are destroyed by moderate heat when cooking.[41] A number of species of mushrooms are poisonous; although some resemble certain edible species, consuming them could be fatal. Eating mushrooms gathered in the wild is risky and should only be undertaken by individuals knowledgeable in mushroom identification. Common best practice is for wild mushroom pickers to focus on collecting a small number of visually distinctive, edible mushroom species that cannot be easily confused with poisonous varieties. Common mushroom hunting advice is that if a mushroom cannot be positively identified, it should be considered poisonous and not eaten.[42] Many mushroom species produce secondary metabolites that can be toxic, mind-altering, antibiotic, antiviral, or bioluminescent. Although there are only a small number of deadly species, several others can cause particularly severe and unpleasant symptoms. Toxicity likely plays a role in protecting the function of the basidiocarp: the mycelium has expended considerable energy and protoplasmic material to develop a structure to efficiently distribute its spores. One defense against consumption and premature destruction is the evolution of chemicals that render the mushroom inedible, either causing the consumer to vomit the meal (see emetics), or to learn to avoid consumption altogether. In addition, due to the propensity of mushrooms to absorb heavy metals, including those that are radioactive, as late as 2008, European mushrooms may have included toxicity from the 1986 Chernobyl disaster and continued to be studied.[43][44] Mushrooms with psychoactive properties have long played a role in various native medicine traditions in cultures all around the world. They have been used as sacrament in rituals aimed at mental and physical healing, and to facilitate visionary states. One such ritual is the velada ceremony. A practitioner of traditional mushroom use is the shaman or curandera (priest-healer).[45] Psilocybin mushrooms, also referred to as psychedelic mushrooms, possess psychedelic properties. Commonly known as \"magic mushrooms\" or \"'shrooms\", they are openly available in smart shops in many parts of the world, or on the black market in those countries which have outlawed their sale. Psilocybin mushrooms have been reported to facilitate profound and life-changing insights often described as mystical experiences. Recent scientific work has supported these claims, as well as the long-lasting effects of such induced spiritual experiences.[46] Psilocybin, a naturally occurring chemical in certain psychedelic mushrooms such as Psilocybe cubensis, is being studied for its ability to help people suffering from psychological disorders, such as obsessive\u2013compulsive disorder. Minute amounts have been reported to stop cluster and migraine headaches.[48] A double-blind study, done by  Johns Hopkins Hospital, showed psychedelic mushrooms could provide people an experience with substantial personal meaning and spiritual significance. In the study, one third of the subjects reported ingestion of psychedelic mushrooms was the single most spiritually significant event of their lives. Over two-thirds reported it among their five most meaningful and spiritually significant events. On the other hand, one-third of the subjects reported extreme anxiety. However the anxiety went away after a short period of time.[49] Psilocybin mushrooms have also shown to be successful in treating addiction, specifically with alcohol and cigarettes.[50] A few species in the genus Amanita, most recognizably A. muscaria, but also A. pantherina, among others, contain the psychoactive compound muscimol. The muscimol-containing chemotaxonomic group of Amanitas contains no amatoxins or phallotoxins, and as such are not hepatoxic, though if not properly cured will be non-lethally neurotoxic due to the presence of ibotenic acid. The Amanita intoxication is similar to Z-drugs in that it includes CNS depressant and sedative-hypnotic effects, but also dissociation and delirium in high doses. Some mushrooms are used in folk medicine.[51] In a few countries, extracts, such as polysaccharide-K, schizophyllan, polysaccharide peptide, or lentinan, are government-registered adjuvant cancer therapies,[52][53][51] but clinical evidence for efficacy and safety of these extracts in humans has not been confirmed.[51][54] Although some mushroom species or their extracts may be consumed for therapeutic effects, some regulatory agencies, such as the US Food and Drug Administration, regard such use as a dietary supplement, which does not have government approval or common clinical use as a prescription drug.[51] Mushrooms can be used for dyeing wool and other natural fibers. The chromophores of mushroom dyes are organic compounds and produce strong and vivid colors, and all colors of the spectrum can be achieved with mushroom dyes. Before the invention of synthetic dyes, mushrooms were the source of many textile dyes.[55] Some fungi, types of polypores loosely called mushrooms, have been used as fire starters (known as tinder fungi). Mushrooms and other fungi play a role in the development of new biological remediation techniques (e.g., using mycorrhizae to spur plant growth) and filtration technologies (e.g. using fungi to lower bacterial levels in contaminated water).[56] There is an ongoing research in the field of genetic engineering aimed towards creation of the enhanced qualities of mushrooms for such domains as nutritional value enhancement, as well as medical use.[57]", "Thandai": "Thandai is a South Asian cold drink prepared with a mixture of almonds, fennel seeds, watermelon kernels, rose petals, pepper, poppy seeds, cardamom, saffron, milk and sugar. It is native to Indian Subcontinent. It is mainly used in summer. In Hinduism, it is often associated with the Maha Shivaratri and Holi or Holla mahalla  festival. It is most commonly consumed in hot areas of North India (Uttar Pradesh) and Pakistan (Southern Punjab, Sindh, and Balochistan). There are variants of thandai and the most common are badam (almond) thandai and bhang (cannabis) thandai. Though thandai refers to a traditional festival drink made with various spices and nuts, this versatile drink can also be prepared in many different ways. Chilled or sometimes hot", "Bhatoora": " Bhatura (also known as batoora, bhatoora, batura, or pathora) (Hindi: \u092d\u091f\u0942\u0930\u093e, Punjabi: \u0a2d\u0a1f\u0a42\u0a30\u0a3e) is a fluffy deep-fried leavened sourdough bread originating from the Indian subcontinent.[1] It is commonly served as a midday meal or a breakfast dish in northern and eastern India.[1] Paired with chickpea curry (called chole or channe), it forms a traditional dish called chole bhature. This bread is like the puri bread but is made with leavened dough.[2] A typical recipe includes all-purpose flour (maida), dahi (yogurt), ghee or oil, and either yeast or baking powder. Once kneaded well, the dough is left to rise, and then small balls of this dough are either hand-rolled or flattened using a rolling pin. The bread pieces are then deep fried until they puff up into a lightly browned, soft, fluffy bread, which is elastic and chewy.[3] Bhatura is often eaten with yogurt, pickle, or vegetables. When eaten with chole, it forms a popular traditional dish known as chole bhature.[1][4] A variation of this dish is to use semolina flour instead of all purpose flour. [5] Other variations include aloo bhatura (bhatura filled with potato) and paneer bhatura (bhatura filled with paneer). A nonfried variant is the kulcha, which can be baked or cooked on a flat pan and is garnished with coriander leaves.  This Indian cuisine\u2013related article is a stub.

It is one of the signature recipes of Kashmiri cuisine. A number of origins of the name have been suggested. Rawghan means \"clarified butter\"[3] or \"oil\" in Persian, while j\u014d\u0161 means to \"stew\" or \"braise\"[4] and ultimately derives from the verb j\u014d\u0161\u012bdan meaning \"to boil\". Rogan josh, by this definition, may mean \"stewed in ghee\".[4] An alternative etymology is that the name derives from either the word roghan (Hindi: \u0930\u094b\u0917\u0928, Urdu: \u0631\u0648\u063a\u0646), \"brown\" or \"red\",[2] or the Koshur roghan, \"red\",[5] along with the word either for \"meat\", (go\u0161t) often romanized as \"rogan ghosht\" or \"gosht\",[6] or a word meaning \"juice\", giving possible meanings of \"red meat\" or \"red juice\".[7] The exact etymology remains uncertain as both \"rogan josh\" and \"rogan ghosht\" are used to refer to the dish and it is unclear which of the names is the original.[6] Rogan josh is a staple of Kashmiri cuisine and is one of the main dishes of the Kashmiri multicourse meal (the wazwan). The dish was originally brought to Kashmir by the Mughals, whose cuisine was, in turn, influenced by Persian cuisine. The unrelenting summer heat of the central Indian plains took the Mughals frequently to the country's northern region, Kashmir, which has a cooler climate because of its elevation and latitude.[3] Rogan josh consists of pieces of lamb or mutton braised with a gravy flavoured with garlic, ginger and aromatic spices (clove, bay leaves, cardamom, and cinnamon), and in some versions incorporating onions or yoghurt.[8] After initial braising, the dish may be finished using the dampokhtak slow cooking technique.[9] Its characteristic deep red colour traditionally comes from dried flowers or root of Alkanna tinctoria (ratan jot)[7] and from liberal amounts of dried, deseeded Kashmiri chillies (lal mirch). These chillies, whose flavour approximates that of paprika, are considerably milder than the typical dried chillies used in Indian cuisine, whose flavor and heat level are similar to cayenne pepper. The recipe's spice emphasises aroma rather than heat. Saffron is also part of some traditional recipes. There are different approaches in preparation: Some use praan, a local form of shallot, and petals of maval, the cockscomb flower, for colouring (and for its supposed \"cooling\" effect);[8] others may add yoghurt and asafoetida to give additional body and flavor.[8] While the traditional preparation uses whole dried chilies that are de-seeded, soaked in water, and ground to a paste, non-traditional shortcuts use either Kashmiri chili powder (available in Indian stores) or a mixture of paprika (predominantly) and cayenne pepper, adjusted to taste. (Madhur Jaffrey's recipe[10] calls for a 4:1 ratio of paprika to cayenne.) An updated version served in Sanjeev Kapoor's restaurants uses white and black cardamom, anise, and bay leaves.[11] Many western interpretations of the dish add tomatoes to the sauce. This is especially common with ready-made pour-over cooking sauces to the point where the dish may be considered tomato-based. The authenticity of including tomatoes is disputed: some authors state that tomatoes are not part of the traditional dish or of traditional Indian cuisine and should not be included.[12] However, other authors have specifically referred to rogan josh as a dish based around meat and tomatoes,[13] while others have identified tomatoes with a Punjabi version of the dish as opposed to a Kashmiri one.[14] There is a variety with beef as well, brisket being preferred.[15] Hot", "Kheema": "Ground meat, called mince or minced meat outside North America, is meat finely chopped by a meat grinder or a chopping knife. A common type of ground meat is ground beef, but many other types of meats are prepared in a similar fashion, including pork, veal, lamb, goat meat, and poultry. Ground meat is used in a wide variety of dishes, by itself, or mixed with other ingredients. It may be formed into meatballs which are then fried, baked, steamed, or braised. They may be cooked on a skewer to produce dishes such as adana kebab\u0131 and \u0107evapi. It may be formed into patties which are then grilled or fried (hamburger), breaded and fried (menchi-katsu, Pozharsky cutlet), or braised (Salisbury steak). It may be formed into meatloaves or p\u00e2t\u00e9s and baked. It may also be used as a filling or stuffing for meat pies such as Shepherd's pie and b\u00f6reks, and also as stuffing. It may be cooked and served as a hash or loosemeat. It may be made into meat sauce such as rag\u00f9, which in turn is used in dishes like pastitsio and moussaka, or mixed with sauce and served on a bun as a sloppy joe sandwich. It may also be cooked with beans, tomatoes, and/or spices to make chili con carne. In the Indian subcontinent, minced meat is used in a variety of dishes such as a stewed or fried curry dish of minced beef, mutton (i.e., goat meat or chevon) or other kinds of meat with green peas or potatoes. It usually includes ghee/butter, onions, garlic, ginger, chilis, and spices. Minced meat is called keema or qeema in the Indian subcontinent.[1] Keema can be grilled on a skewer and is then called seekh kebab, or it is used as a filling for samosas or naan. The word ultimately comes from the Turkic word q\u0131yma meaning 'minced meat', and is thus related to the Persian qeyme, Turkish k\u0131yma, and Greek kim\u00e1s.[2][3] Ground meat has food safety concerns very different from whole cuts of meat. If undercooked, it can lead to food poisoning.[4] In a whole cut from an animal, the interior of the meat is essentially sterile, even before cooking; any bacterial contamination is on the outer surface of the meat. This is why, for example, it is typically safe for humans to consume steak that is cooked \"rare\" in such a way that the interior of the cut remains red in colour - the searing of the exterior of the meat is enough to kill any bacteria on the surface. However, when meat is ground, bacterial contamination from the surface can be distributed throughout the meat. If ground beef is not well cooked all the way through, there is a significant chance that enough pathogenic bacteria will survive to cause illness. Moreover, the warming will speed the reproduction of bacteria.[5][6] Undercooked Jack in the Box hamburgers contaminated in this manner were responsible for four deaths and the illness of hundreds of people in 1993.[7] To ensure the safety of ground meat distributed through the National School Lunch Program, food banks, federal food and nutrition programs, the United States Department of Agriculture has established food safety and quality requirements for the ground beef that it purchases. A 2010 United States National Research Council report reviewed the scientific basis of the Department's ground beef safety standards, evaluated how the standards compare to those used by large retail and commercial food service purchasers of ground beef, and looked at ways to establish periodic evaluations of the Federal Purchase Ground Beef Program.[8] The report found that although the safety requirements could be strengthened using scientific concepts, the prevention of future outbreaks of food-borne disease will depend on eliminating contamination during production and ensuring meat is properly cooked before it is served.[9]", "Ras Malai ": " Ras malai, also known as rasamalei, or roshmalai, is a dessert that invented in Kolkata, British India at 1868 by Krishna Chandra Das.[1] The dessert is called roshmalai in Bengali,[2] ras malai in Hindi,[3] and rasa malei in Odia.[4] It is popular in India, Bangladesh and Pakistan.[5] The original term for ras malai is \"rosho malai (Bengali: \u09b0\u09b8\u09ae\u09be\u09b2\u09be\u0987) which derived from the Classical Bengali word \"rosho malai\" with the same meaning. The term is made with a Bengali word Rosh (Bengali: \u09b0\u09b8) which means sap and a Hindustani word Malai (Hindi: \u092e\u0932\u093e\u0908, Urdu: \u0645\u0644\u0627\u0626\u06cc) which means clotted cream hence the name of the sweet sap of clotted cream.[3] Das Grandsons say that their forefather Krishna Chandra Das invented the ras malai in the early 20th century. His father, Nobin Chandra had come to Calcutta and opened a sweet shop in 1866. He wanted to create an entirely new dish, so he did a lot of experimentation and ended up inventing the rasmalai in 1868. Ras malai consists of flattened balls of chhena soaked in malai (a type of clotted cream) flavoured with cardamom. Milk is boiled and a bit of vinegar or lime juice is added to split it. The whey is discarded and the milk solids are drained, cooled and kneaded into a dough. The dough is divided into small balls and the balls are cooked in hot water with a bit of rose water added. The balls are then cooked in milk with saffron, pistachios and kheer as stuffing.[6] Different types of ras malai also can be found in different areas such Rasmanjuri of Rangpur division. In Dhaka and Rangpur, the ras malais are similar in shape to the rasgullas,[7] and round discs. This Indian cuisine\u2013related article is a stub. You can help Wikipedia by expanding it.

Cold", "Panipuri": "   Pani puri (p\u0101n\u012b p\u016br\u012b\u24d8)[a] is a deep-fried breaded hollow spherical shell, about 1 inch (25\u00a0mm) in diameter, filled with a combination of finely diced potato, onion, peas, and chickpea. It is a common street food in the Indian subcontinent. It is often spiced with tamarind chutney, chili powder, or chaat masala.[3][4][5] A Bengali variant, fuchka,[b] uses spiced mashed potatoes and dal or ghugni as the filling.[6] Panipuri has many regional names in the Indian subcontinent:[1][7] Maharashtra and South India: Pani Puri; Haryana: paani patashi; Madhya Pradesh: fulki; Uttar Pradesh: pani ke batashe/padake; Assam: phuska/puska; Gujarat: Pakodi; Odisha: Gup-chup; Pakistan, Delhi: Gol Gappa; West Bengal and Bihar: Phuchka. According to culinary anthropologist Kurush Dalal, chaat originated in the North Indian region of what is now Uttar Pradesh. Gol Gappa originated in India. He also noted that it possibly originated from Raj-Kachori: an accidentally-made smaller puri giving birth to panipuri.[8] Panipuri spread to the rest of India mainly due to the migration of people from one part of the country to another in the 20th century.[4] On 10 March 2005, the word \"panipuri\" was added to the Oxford English Dictionary.[9] In 2024, Costco began stocking panipuri.[10] Pani puri has evolved significantly over time. Also known as \"gol gappa,\" the dish consisted of a small, hollow, fried wheat shell filled with spiced mashed potatoes and served with a tamarind or mint-flavoured water. Over time, variations of the filling and the flavoured water emerged, reflecting the regional preferences and availability of ingredients. The flavoured water, also known as the \"pani,\" is an essential component of the dish and is often the main source of flavour. Some of the most popular flavours of pani puri include the traditional tamarind and mint water, as well as spicy variations like jalape\u00f1o or green chili water, and tangy flavours like lemon or tomato water.[11] Some regional variations also use sweet flavours like fruit juices or dates.[11] Bangerpet Panipuri is renowned for its distinctive white-colored pani, retaining a spicy kick that has been traditionally handed down through generations.[12]", "Chapatis": " Chapati (alternatively spelled chapathi; pronounced as IAST: cap\u0101t\u012b, cap\u0101\u1e6d\u012b, c\u0101p\u0101\u1e6di), also known as roti, rooti, rotee, rotli,  rotta, safati, shabaati, phulka (in Marathi),  chapo (in East Africa), sada roti (in the Caribbean), poli, and roshi (in the Maldives),[1] is an unleavened flatbread originating from the Indian subcontinent and is a staple in India, Nepal, Bangladesh, Pakistan, Kyrgyzstan, Sri Lanka, the Arabian Peninsula, East Africa, and the Caribbean.[2] Chapatis are made of whole-wheat flour known as atta, mixed into dough with water, oil (optional), and salt (optional) in a mixing utensil called a parat, and are cooked on a tava (flat skillet).[3][4] It is a common staple in the Indian subcontinent as well as amongst expatriates from the Indian subcontinent throughout the world. Chapatis were also introduced to other parts of the world by immigrants from the Indian subcontinent, particularly by Indian merchants to Central Asia, Southeast Asia, East Africa, and the Caribbean.[5] The word chapati is derived from the Sanskrit word \u091a\u0930\u094d\u092a\u091f\u0940[6] (charpa\u1e6d\u012b). From a derivative of Sanskrit *\u091a\u0930\u094d\u092a (charpa, \u201cflat\u201d). Chapati is a form of roti or rotta (bread). The words are often used interchangeably. The word chapat (Marathi: \u091a\u093e\u092a\u091f) means \"slap\" or \"flat,\" describing the traditional method of forming round pieces of thin dough by slapping the dough between the wetted palms of the hands. With each slap, the piece of dough is rotated. The word chapati is noted in the 16th-century document Ain-i-Akbari  by Abu'l-Fazl ibn Mubarak, vizier of Mughal Emperor Akbar.[2] Chapatis are one of the most common forms of wheat bread, a staple food in the Indian subcontinent. The carbonized wheat grains discovered at the excavations at Mohenjo-daro are of a similar variety to an endemic species of wheat still found in India. The Indus Valley is known to be one of the ancestral lands of cultivated wheat. Chapatis, along with rotis, were introduced to other parts of the world by immigrants from the Indian subcontinent, particularly by Indian merchants who settled in Southeast Asia and the Caribbean islands.[5] Chapatis are made using a soft dough comprising wheat flour and water.[9] It is more finely ground than most Western-style whole wheat flours. Chapati dough is typically prepared with flour and water, kneaded with the knuckles of the hand made into a fist and left to rest for at least 10 or 15 minutes to an hour for the gluten in the dough to relax. After proofing, the dough becomes softer and more pliable. Small portions of the dough are pinched off and formed into round balls that are pressed between the two palms to form discs which are then dipped into flour and rolled out on a circular rolling board (a chakla), using a rolling pin known as a velan or belan, into a flat disc.[10] There are also automatic roti makers which automate the whole process.[11] The rolled-out dough is then thrown on the preheated dry tava and cooked on both sides. In some regions of the Indian subcontinent chapatis are only partially cooked on the skillet, and then cooked directly over a flame, which makes them puff up. The hot steam cooks the chapati rapidly from the inside. In some parts of northern India and eastern Pakistan, this is called a phulka. In southern parts of India, it is called a pulka. It is also possible to puff up the roti directly on the tava.[12] Once cooked, chapatis are often topped with butter or ghee.[13] In western regions of Maharashtra, some oil is added inside the rolled-out dough and then put on the tava; this is distinct from paratha. Chapati diameter and thickness vary from region to region. Chapatis made in domestic kitchens are usually not larger than 15 centimetres (6\u00a0in) to 18 centimetres (7\u00a0in) in diameter since the tava on which they are made comes in sizes that fit comfortably on a domestic stovetop. Tavas were traditionally made of unglazed earthenware, but are now typically made from metal. The shape of the rolling pin also varies from region to region. Some households simply use a kitchen worktop as a sort of pastry board, but round flat-topped \"boards\" made of wood, stone, or stainless steel are available specifically for rolling out chapatis.[5] In most parts of the Indian subcontinent, there is a distinction made between chapati and other related flatbreads eaten in the region like roti, paratha, kulcha, puri and naan based on cooking technique, texture and use of different types of flours. For example, parathas are either made layered by spreading them with ghee, folding and rolling out again into a disc which turns out flakey once cooked, or are filled with spinach, dal or cooked radish or potato. Parathas are mostly made using all-purpose flour instead of whole wheat flour.[14] There are many regional varieties of chapati in India: In the Maldives, chapatis are traditionally eaten for breakfast along with a dish known as mas huni.[15] Flatbreads are staples of Indian food. Chapatis go well with curries, dry sabzis or sabjis (vegetables cooked in gravy), chutneys or dal.[16]", "Masala Chai ": " Masala chai (/m\u0259\u02c8s\u0251\u02d0l\u0259 t\u0283a\u026a/; lit.\u2009'mixed-spice tea') is a popular beverage throughout South Asia, originating in India. It is made by brewing black tea (usually crush, tear, curl) in milk and water, and then by sweetening with sugar. Adding aromatic herbs and spices creates masala chai, although chai is often prepared unspiced.[2][3] The term chai originated from the Chinese word for tea, cha (see Etymology of tea) via the Hindi chai (\u091a\u093e\u092f). In English, this spiced tea is commonly referred to as chai tea,[4] or simply chai.[5] Originating in India,[1][6] the beverage has gained worldwide popularity, becoming a feature in many coffee and tea houses, with many using the term chai latte or chai tea latte for their version to indicate that it is made with steamed milk, much like that used to make a caff\u00e8 latte but mixed with a spiced tea concentrate instead of espresso. Tea was introduced to India by the British as a popular beverage. Tea plants have grown wild in the Assam region since antiquity, but historically, Indians viewed tea as a herbal medicine rather than as a recreational beverage.[7] In the 1830s, the British East India Company became concerned about the Chinese monopoly on tea, which constituted most of its trade and supported the enormous consumption of tea in Great Britain around 1 pound (0.45\u00a0kg) per person per year. British colonists had recently noticed the existence of the Assamese tea plants, and began to cultivate tea plantations locally. In 1870, over 90% of the tea consumed in Great Britain was still of Chinese origin, but by 1900, this had dropped to 10%, largely replaced by tea grown in India (50%) and Ceylon (33%).[8] However, consumption of black tea within India remained low until the promotional campaign by the Indian Tea Association in the early 20th century, which encouraged factories, mines, and textile mills to provide tea breaks for their workers. It also supported many independent chaiwalas throughout the growing railway system.[9] Tea was promoted as served Indian style, with small added amounts of milk and sugar. The Indian Tea Association initially disapproved of independent vendors' tendency to add spices and greatly increase the proportions of milk and sugar, thus reducing their usage (and thus purchase) of tea leaves per liquid volume. However, chai later firmly established itself as a popular beverage.[10] Black tea is typically used as base in most chai recipes. The most common type of black tea is Assam; however, a blend of different tea variations may be used.[11] Assam, Darjeeling, and Nilgiri are the three most common types of tea used in chai in India.[12] The spices used in masala chai often include cardamon, ginger, cinnamon, clove, and more. Mint and lemongrass may also be used in masala chai. [13] Masala chai in western India often excludes clove and black peppercorn. A small amount of salt is often added to chai in the region of Bhopal.[14] The Kashmiri version of chai is brewed with green tea instead of black tea and has a more subtle blend of spices with a pinch of salt. This version is a bit savory and is pink in color, due to the addition of baking soda.[15] Traditionally in India, water buffalo milk is used to make chai.[16][17] Although whole milk is usually used in masala chai, alternative dairy milk such as soy milk or skim milk is also a preferred option across the world.[18] White sugar, brown sugar, Demerara sugar, or honey may be used as sweetener in chai. Jaggery may also be used as a sweetener.[19] Masala chai is composed of three major components: masala, chai (or tea), and milk. Recipes and preparation of chai can vary by geography and by family. One way to prep masala chai is by gently boiling water with spices in a pot. Tea is then added to the pot and brewed to preference. Once brewing is complete, the tea and spice mixture is strained into a cup. Milk or cream can then be added.[20] A common Maharashtrian practice for preparation of one cup of chai is to first combine one half cup of water with one-half cup of milk in a pot over heat. Sugar may be added at this point or after. Ginger is then grated into the mixture followed by adding a \"tea masala\". Although the ingredients may vary from region to region, \"tea masala\" typically consists of crushed ginger, crushed cardamom, lemongrass, cloves, and cinnamon.[21] The mixture is brought to a boil and 1 teaspoon of loose black tea[22] is added. Over the last few years, chai has gained popularity for it complex flavors as well as the numerous health benefits consuming chai provides. The blend of black tea leaves with spices such as ginger, cardamom, cinnamon, cloves, and black pepper provides a rich source of antioxidants.[23] Antioxidants help reduce inflammation and support heart health. Ginger and cinnamon, in particular have shown properties that reduce blood pressure and boost immunity. [24]The combination of spices in chai also offers a warming effect which aids overall digestion and improves circulation. Depending on how its is made, it can have less caffeine content than coffee, making it a better alternative for those with caffeine intolerance.[25] Small vendors (called chaiwalla in Hindi/cha-ola in Bengali) are found by the side of every highway, road and alley \u2013 often the only establishments that will be open through the night. They generally also sell tobacco and snacks. Many will deliver tea to people's places of business in a chaidaan, a wooden or metal frame carrier for cups.[26] In the metropolitan city of Mumbai, roadside tea stalls serve smaller cups of tea at a lower budget which is referred to as 'cutting chai', the term 'cutting' referring to the halving of quantity contained in a full cup to reduce the cost of the cup of tea.[27] In Pakistan, masala chai is usually brewed with milk and sweetened with spices like nutmeg, cinnamon and/or cloves.[28] Chai can also be served in a kulhad.[29] Masala chai is popular in East Africa and the Caribbean.[30][31] It is also quite popular in the GCC; but it is locally known as Karak Tea or Chai Karak (Arabic: \u0634\u0627\u064a \u0643\u0631\u0643, Urdu: \u06a9\u0691\u06a9 \u0686\u0627\u0626\u06d2).[32] In the West, to better simulate water buffalo milk, one may try using dry or powdered milk, along with the raw or turbinado sugar normally used in India. In addition, as milk consumption in all age groups in the West has started to decrease steadily over the last 50 years, substitutes such as oat and almond milk have emerged as an alternative to water buffalo milk.[33] As an alternative to the hot tea format, several types of cold \"chai\" beverages have become popular in the United States. These range in complexity from a simple spiced iced tea without milk to a slush of spiced tea, ice, and milk (or nondairy creamer) mixed in a blender and topped with whipped cream.[34] Chai with added espresso is  called a  \"dirty chai\" in America, as well as \"java chai\", \"red eye chai\", \"turbocharger\", \"chai charger\", \"tough guy chai\", etc.[35][36]", "Rasam": "Rasam refers to:", "Murukku": " Mu\u1e5fukku  (Tamil: \u0bae\u0bc1\u0bb1\u0bc1\u0b95\u0bcd\u0b95\u0bc1, romanized:\u00a0mu\u1e5fukku, lit.\u2009'twisting') is a savoury, crunchy snack originating from the Indian subcontinent. The name mu\u1e5fukku \"twisting\" refers to its shape.[1] In India, murukku is especially common in the states of Andhra Pradesh, Odisha, Tamil Nadu, Karnataka, and Kerala. It is called murkulu or janthukulu in Andhra Pradesh. It is also common in countries with substantial Indian and Sri Lankan diaspora communities, including Singapore, Fiji, Malaysia, and Myanmar. Called sagalay gway (\u1005\u102c\u1000\u101c\u1031\u1038\u1001\u103d\u1031; lit.\u2009'baby sparrow coils') in Burmese, it is a common snack and is used as a topping for a regional dish called dawei mont di.[2] Other names of the dish include Kannada: \u0c9a\u0c95\u0ccd\u0c95\u0cc1\u0cb2\u0cbf, romanized:\u00a0cakkuli,  Odia: \u0b26\u0b3e\u0b28\u0b4d\u0b24\u0b15\u0b32\u0b3f, romanized:\u00a0d\u0101ntakali, Marathi: \u091a\u0915\u0932\u0940, romanized:\u00a0cakal\u012b,  Gujarati: \u0a9a\u0a95\u0ab0\u0ac0, romanized:\u00a0cakri, Telugu: \u0c1a\u0c15\u0c4d\u0c30\u0c3e\u0c32\u0c41, romanized:\u00a0cakr\u0101lu or \u0c1c\u0c02\u0c24\u0c3f\u0c15\u0c32\u0c41 jantikalu, and Konkani: chakri or chakkuli. Murukku is typically made from rice flour and Vigna mungo flour. Chakli is a similar dish, typically made with an additional ingredient, chickpea flour. It is the origin of the Tamil saying Tamil: \u0baa\u0bb2\u0bcd\u0bb2\u0bb1\u0bcd\u0bb1 \u0ba4\u0bbe\u0ba4\u0bcd\u0ba4\u0bbe\u0b95\u0bcd\u0b95\u0bc1 \u0bae\u0bc1\u0bb1\u0bc1\u0b95\u0bcd\u0b95\u0bc1 \u0bb5\u0bc7\u0ba3\u0bcd\u0b9f\u0bc1\u0bae\u0bbe\u0bae\u0bcd ('toothless grandfather wants murukku'), meaning someone wants something they cannot use; murukku is very hard and can break teeth and orthodontic devices. Murukku is typically made from rice and Vigna mungo \"black gram\" flour.[3] The flours are mixed with water, salt, chili powder, asafoetida and either sesame seeds or cumin seeds. The mix is kneaded into a dough, which is shaped into spiral or coil shapes either by hand or extruded using a mould. The spirals are then deep-fried in vegetable oil. The dish has many variations, resulting from the types and proportions of flours used. Mullu mu\u1e5fukku \"thorn mu\u1e5fukku\" has an uneven texture that gives it an extra crunch. The Kai murukku \"hand murukku\") is made by hand using a stiffer dough. Pakoda mu\u1e5fukku is another ribbon-shaped variety of the snack.[4] \u0100\u1e6d\u1e6daiy\u0101mpa\u1e6d\u1e6di kai mu\u1e5fukku, a town in Tamil Nadu, is known for its unique variety of murukkus, known as Ma\u1e47app\u0101\u1e5fai mu\u1e5fukku. This gained popularity because of Krishnan Iyer, who prepared and sold this first in Ma\u1e47app\u0101\u1e5fai.[5][6][7] In 2010, the Tamil Nadu government applied for a geographical indication tag for Manapparai Murukku.[8] Some of the murukku varieties include: ", "Creams": " Cream is a dairy product composed of the higher-fat layer skimmed from the top of milk before homogenization. In un-homogenized milk, the fat, which is less dense, eventually rises to the top. In the industrial production of cream, this process is accelerated by using centrifuges called \"separators\". In many countries, it is sold in several grades depending on the total butterfat content. It can be dried to a powder for shipment to distant markets, and contains high levels of saturated fat.[1][2] Cream skimmed from milk may be called \"sweet cream\" to distinguish it from cream skimmed from whey, a by-product of cheese-making. Whey cream has a lower fat content and tastes more salty, tangy, and \"cheesy\".[3] In many countries partially fermented cream is also sold: sour cream, cr\u00e8me fra\u00eeche, and so on.  Both forms have many culinary uses in both sweet and savoury dishes. Cream produced by cattle (particularly Jersey cattle) grazing on natural pasture often contains some carotenoid pigments derived from the plants they eat; traces of these intensely colored pigments give milk a slightly yellow tone, hence the name of the yellowish-white color: cream. Carotenoids are also the origin of butter's yellow color. Cream from goat's milk, water buffalo milk, or from cows fed indoors on grain or grain-based pellets, is white.[4] Cream is used as an ingredient in many foods, including ice cream, many sauces, soups, stews, puddings, and some custard bases, and is also used for cakes. Whipped cream is served as a topping on ice cream sundaes, milkshakes, lassi, eggnog, sweet pies, strawberries, blueberries, or peaches. Cream is also used in Indian curries such as masala dishes. Cream (usually light/single cream or half and half) may be added to coffee. Both single and double cream (see Types for definitions) can be used in cooking. Double cream or full-fat cr\u00e8me fra\u00eeche is often used when the cream is added to a hot sauce, to prevent it separating or \"splitting\". Double cream can be thinned with milk to make an approximation of single cream. The French word cr\u00e8me denotes not only dairy cream but also other thick liquids such as sweet and savory custards, which are normally made with milk, not cream.[5] Different grades of cream are distinguished by their fat content, whether they have been heat-treated, whipped, and so on. In many jurisdictions, there are regulations for each type. The Australia New Zealand Food Standards Code \u2013 Standard 2.5.2 \u2013 Defines cream as a milk product comparatively rich in fat, in the form of an emulsion of fat-in-skim milk, which can be obtained by separation from milk. Cream sold without further specification must contain no less than 350 g/kg (35%) milk fat.[6] Manufacturers labels may distinguish between different fat contents, a general guideline is as follows: Canadian cream definitions are similar to those used in the United States, except for \"light cream\", which is very low-fat cream, usually with 5 or 6 percent butterfat.[8] Specific product characteristics are generally uniform throughout Canada, but names vary by both geographic and linguistic area and by manufacturer: \"coffee cream\" may be 10 or 18 percent cream and \"half-and-half\" (cr\u00e8me l\u00e9g\u00e8re) may be 3, 5, 6 or 10 percent, all depending on location and brand.[9][10] Regulations allow cream to contain acidity regulators and stabilizers. For whipping cream, allowed additives include skim milk powder (\u2264 0.25%), glucose solids (\u2264 0.1%), calcium sulphate (\u2264 0.005%), and xanthan gum (\u2264 0.02%).[11] The content of milk fat in canned cream must be displayed as a percentage followed by \"milk fat\", \"B.F\", or \"M.F\".[12] In France, the use of the term \"cream\" for food products is defined by the decree 80-313 of April 23, 1980.[13] It specifies the minimum rate of milk fat (12%) as well as the rules for pasteurisation or UHT sterilisation. The mention \"cr\u00e8me fra\u00eeche\" (fresh cream) can only be used for pasteurised creams conditioned on production site within 24h after pasteurisation. Even if food additives complying with French and European laws are allowed, usually, none will be found in plain \"cr\u00e8mes\" and \"cr\u00e8mes fra\u00eeches\" apart from lactic ferments (some low cost creams (or close to creams) can contain thickening agents, but rarely).[citation needed] Fat content is commonly shown as \"XX% M.G.\" (\"mati\u00e8re grasse\"). (usually 30%) (usually 15%) (usually 30%) (usually 15%) Russia, as well as other EAC countries, legally separates cream into two classes: normal (10\u201334% butterfat) and heavy (35\u201358%),[14] but the industry has pretty much standardized around the following types: In Sweden, cream is usually sold as: Mellangr\u00e4dde (27%) is, nowadays, a less common variant. \nGr\u00e4ddfil (usually 12%) and Creme Fraiche (usually around 35%) are two common sour cream products. In Switzerland, the types of cream are legally defined[17] as follows: Sour cream and cr\u00e8me fra\u00eeche (German: Sauerrahm, Cr\u00e8me fra\u00eeche; French: cr\u00e8me acidul\u00e9e, cr\u00e8me fra\u00eeche; Italian: panna acidula, cr\u00e8me fra\u00eeche) are defined as cream soured by bacterial cultures. Thick cream (German: verdickter Rahm; French: cr\u00e8me \u00e9paissie; Italian: panna addensata) is defined as cream thickened using thickening agents. In the United Kingdom, these types of cream are produced.[19] Fat content must meet the Food Labelling Regulations 1996.[20] In the United States, cream is usually sold as: Not all grades are defined by all jurisdictions, and the exact fat content ranges vary. The above figures, except for \"manufacturer's cream\", are based on the Code of Federal Regulations, Title 21, Part 131.[21][22] Cream may have thickening agents and stabilizers added. Thickeners include sodium alginate, carrageenan, gelatine, sodium bicarbonate, tetrasodium pyrophosphate, and alginic acid.[23]:\u200a296\u200a[24] Other processing may be carried out. For example, cream has a tendency to produce oily globules (called \"feathering\") when added to coffee. The stability of the cream may be increased by increasing the non-fat solids content, which can be done by partial demineralisation and addition of sodium caseinate, although this is expensive.[23]:\u200a297 Butter is made by churning cream to separate the butterfat and buttermilk. This can be done by hand or by machine. Whipped cream is made by whisking or mixing air into cream with more than 30% fat, to turn the liquid cream into a soft solid. Nitrous oxide, from whipped-cream chargers may also be used to make whipped cream. Sour cream, produced in many countries, is cream (12 to 16% or more milk fat) that has been subjected to a bacterial culture that produces lactic acid (0.5%+), which sours and thickens it. Cr\u00e8me fra\u00eeche (28% milk fat) is slightly soured with bacterial culture, but not as sour or as thick as sour cream. Mexican crema (or cream espesa) is similar to cr\u00e8me fra\u00eeche. Smetana is a heavy cream-derived (15\u201340% milk fat) Central and Eastern European sweet or sour cream. Rjome or r\u00f8mme is Norwegian sour cream containing 35% milk fat, similar to Icelandic s\u00fdr\u00f0ur rj\u00f3mi. Clotted cream in the United Kingdom is made through a process that starts by slowly heating whole milk to produce a very high-fat (55%) product, similar to Indian malai. Reduced cream is a cream product in New Zealand, often used to make Kiwi dip. Some non-edible substances are called creams due to their consistency: shoe cream is runny, unlike regular waxy shoe polish;  hand/body \"creme\" or \"skin cream\" is meant for moisturizing the skin. Regulations in many jurisdictions restrict the use of the word cream for foods. Words such as creme, kreme, creame, or whipped topping (e.g., Cool Whip) are often used for products which cannot legally be called cream, though in some jurisdictions even these spellings may be disallowed, for example under the doctrine of idem sonans.[25][26] Oreo and Hydrox cookies are a type of sandwich cookie in which two biscuits have a soft, sweet filling between them that is called \"cr\u00e8me filling.\" In some cases, foods can be described as cream although they do not contain predominantly milk fats; for example, in Britain, \"ice cream\" can contain non-milk fat (declared on the label) in addition to or instead of cream, and salad cream is the customary name for a non-dairy condiment that has been produced since the 1920s.[27] In other languages, cognates of \"cream\" are also sometimes used for non-food products, such as fogkr\u00e9m (Hungarian for toothpaste), or Sonnencreme (German for sunscreen). Some products are described as \"cream alternatives\". For example, Elmlea Double, etc. are blends of buttermilk or lentils and vegetable oil with other additives sold by Upfield in the United Kingdom packaged and shelved in the same way as cream, labelled as having \"a creamy taste\".[28]", "Kulfi ": "  Kulfi (/k\u028alfi\u02d0/) is a frozen dairy dessert from the Indian subcontinent. It is often described as \"traditional Indian ice cream\".[3] Kulfi originated in 16th-century Delhi during the Mughal era. It is part of the national cuisines of India and Pakistan.[citation needed] It is also popular in Bangladesh, Myanmar, Nepal, Sri Lanka, and the Middle East.[4][better\u00a0source\u00a0needed] Kulfi is denser and creamier than regular ice cream.[3][4][5] It comes in various flavours. Traditional ones include cream (malai), rose, mango, cardamom (elaichi), saffron (kesar or zafran), and pistachio.[4][6][better\u00a0source\u00a0needed] Newer flavours may include apple, orange, strawberry, peanut, or avocado.[4][better\u00a0source\u00a0needed] Unlike ice cream, kulfi is not whipped, which results in a solid, dense dessert similar to frozen custard. Thus, it is sometimes considered a distinct category of frozen dairy-based dessert.[5] The density of kulfi causes it to melt more slowly than ice cream.[7] The word kulfi comes from the Persian qulfi (\u0642\u0644\u0641\u06cc) meaning \"covered cup\". The dessert originated in Delhi during the Mughal Empire in the 16th century.[1][2][8] The mixture of dense evaporated milk was already popular in the sweet dishes in the Indian subcontinent. During the Mughal period, this mixture was flavoured with pistachios and saffron, packed into metal cones and immersed in slurry ice, resulting in the invention of kulfi. Ain-i-Akbari, a detailed record of the Mughal emperor Akbar's administration, mentions use of saltpeter for refrigeration as well as transportation of Himalayan ice to warmer areas.[1][8] Although Delhi has been described as the birthplace of kulfi, Australian food historian Charmaine O'Brien suggests, \"...it is likely that [kulfi] originally evolved in the cooler climates of Persia or Samarkand and that the Mughals appropriated the concept and elaborated on it to create the creamy, perfumed dessert that it now is.\"[2] To prepare kulfi, sweetened, flavoured milk is slow cooked. The milk is stirred almost continuously to prevent it from sticking to the cooking utensil. During this process, the milk condenses and thickens.[9] The slow cooking caramelises the sugar in the mixture and browns its milk proteins, giving kulfi its distinctive taste.[6][10] The mixture is then poured into moulds (often kulhars) and sealed. The sealed moulds are submerged in an insulated matka filled with ice and salt. This quickly freezes the mixture, giving it a soft, smooth consistency free of ice crystals. Kulfi prepared in this traditional way is called matka kulfi.[11] The moulds are removed from the freezer 10\u201315 minutes before serving to allow the kulfi to melt slightly. The kulfi is then removed from the moulds and garnished with ground cardamom, saffron, or pistachios. Kulfi is also served with falooda (vermicelli noodles).[12] Throughout the Indian subcontinent, kulfi is sold by street vendors known as kulfiwallahs. It is also commonly served in Indian restaurants.[13]", "Khagina": " Egg bhurji, also known as Anda Bhurji or Ande ka Khagina, is a scrambled eggs dish which is a popular street food and a breakfast, lunch or dinner recipe. Originating from the Indian subcontinent, it is sometimes compared with the Parsi dish akuri. The Parsi dish Akoori or Akuri is very similar to egg bhurji with a few differences. Just like bhurji, akuri is filled with many aromatics like ginger, onion and other spices. However, bhurji eggs are cooked until dry, whereas akoori eggs are cooked less while still runny. The difference lies in its preparation and addition of saut\u00e9ed chopped onions, chilies and optional spices.[1] Bhurji can be found at highway rest stops and street food stalls across India, sometimes served alongside slices of white bread.[2][failed verification] Heavy with tomatoes, chilies, onion, and fragrant spices, these scrambled eggs make for a substantial and satisfying meal, in a matter of minutes. Egg bhurji goes well with hot chapati, paratha, dinner rolls or buttered toast.[3]  This Indian cuisine\u2013related article is a stub. You can help Wikipedia by expanding it.

Kashmiri kahwah is made by boiling green tea leaves with local saffron, cinnamon, cardamom and occasionally Kashmiri roses. It is generally served with sugar or honey and crushed nuts, usually almonds or walnuts. Some varieties are made as a herbal infusion only\u2014without the green tea leaves. Traditionally, kahwah is prepared in a copper kettle known as a samovar. A samovar, which originates from Russia, consists of a fire container running as a central cavity, in which live coals are placed to keep the tea warm. Around the fire container there is a space for water to boil and the tea leaves and other ingredients are mixed with the water. Kahwah may also be made in normal pots and kettles, as modern day urban living may not always permit the use of elaborate samovars. Sometimes milk is added to the Kahwah, but this is generally given to the elderly or the sick. Peshawari Qehwa (a variety of Kahwah found in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa) is traditionally made with Jasmine tea and green cardamom. It is famously served at chaikhanas (or tea houses) of Qissa Khwani Bazaar. It has always been a part of rich Kashmiri culture. While its exact origins are unclear, kahwa tea leaves are said to have come to Kashmir through the Spice Route, which Kashmir was a central point of. Many believe that it originated during the Kushan empire in the first and second century AD.[1] The word Kahwah in Kashmiri means \"sweetened tea\", though the word also seems to be related to the Turkish word for coffee (kahve) which in turn might be derived from the Arabic word \"qahwah.\" Traditionally, Kashmiris have always referred to kahwa as Mogul chai. Meaning this tea was introduced in the valley back then by the Mughal emperors. Historically, kahwah has been popular as a drink throughout Kashmir, Afghanistan, Central Asia, Iran and the Middle East. Even today, it remains a popular drink of choice in these regions.[2] Today, this historically popular drink is usually served to guests or as part of a celebration dinner, and saffron (kong) is added to the kahwah for special visitors in Kashmir. It is often served in tiny, shallow cups. Kehwa in Kashmir is also commonly served after Wazwan and elaborate family dinners. The green tea leaves are brought in from the neighbouring Kangra region which has been known to historically export green tea to Kashmir, Afghanistan and other parts of Central Asia.[3]", "Scrambled Eggs ": " Scrambled eggs is a dish made from eggs (usually chicken eggs) stirred, whipped, or beaten together typically with salt, butter, oil, and sometimes other ingredients, and heated so that they form into curds.[1][2] The scrambling of eggs is an ancient technique. The earliest documented recipe for scrambled eggs was in the 14th-century Italian cookbook Libro della cucina.[3] Only eggs are necessary to make scrambled eggs,[4][5] but salt, water, chives, cream, cr\u00e8me fra\u00eeche, sour cream, grated cheese and other ingredients may be added:[6][7] recipes vary.[8][9] The eggs are cracked into a bowl with salt and pepper, and the mixture is stirred or whisked.   Alternatively, the eggs are cracked directly into a hot pan or skillet, and the whites and yolks stirred together as they cook. In Food in England (1954) Dorothy Hartley comments, \"There are two main schools: one (which I believe to be correct) breaks in the eggs direct, so that particles of clear white and clear yellow remain in the creamy mass. The other school beats the eggs together first, maintaining it gives a smoother texture\".[10] Elizabeth David (1960) takes the latter view: \"For scrambled eggs, unlike those for an omelette, the eggs should be very well beaten\".[11] The mixture can be poured into a hot pan containing melted butter or oil, where it starts coagulating.[12] The heat is turned down and the eggs are stirred as they cook. This creates small, soft curds of egg. A thin pan is preferable to prevent browning. With continuous stirring, and not allowing the eggs to stick to the pan, the eggs themselves will maintain the pan temperature at about the boiling point of water, until they coagulate. In their Mastering the Art of French Cooking (1961), Simone Beck, Louisette Bertholle and Julia Child write, \"Scrambled eggs in French style are creamy soft curds that just hold their shape from fork to mouth. Their preparation is entirely a matter of stirring the eggs over gentle heat until they slowly thicken as a mass into a custard.\"[13] Alternatively, Escoffier describes using a double boiler[14][15] as the heating source, which does not need adjustment as the direct heating method does. The eggs are directly placed in the cooker and mixed during the heating and not before. Cooking by this method prevents the eggs from browning while being cooked and gives aerated and creamy scrambled eggs.[15] This method was used in the \"old classical kitchen\" and guarantees the eggs are always cooked perfectly; it is, however, more time-consuming than the modern skillet method, taking up to 40 minutes to ensure perfect quality.[14] Once the liquid has mostly set, additional ingredients such as ham, herbs, cheese, or cream[12] may be folded in over low heat until incorporated. The eggs are usually slightly undercooked when removed from heat since the eggs will continue to set. If any liquid is seeping from the eggs (syneresis), this is a sign of undercooking, overcooking, or adding undercooked high-moisture vegetables. Scrambled eggs can be cooked in a microwave oven,[16] and can also be prepared using sous-vide cooking, which gives the traditional smooth creamy texture and requires only occasionally mixing during cooking.[17] Another technique for cooking creamy scrambled eggs is to pipe steam into eggs with butter via a steam wand (as found on an espresso machine).[18] An Italian version of scrambled eggs: Uova stracciate al formaggio. In addition to the eggs and butter, cream is added, and when the eggs are cooked, grated Parmesan cheese is sprinkled on the top.[31]", "Chapati": " Chapati (alternatively spelled chapathi; pronounced as IAST: cap\u0101t\u012b, cap\u0101\u1e6d\u012b, c\u0101p\u0101\u1e6di), also known as roti, rooti, rotee, rotli,  rotta, safati, shabaati, phulka (in Marathi),  chapo (in East Africa), sada roti (in the Caribbean), poli, and roshi (in the Maldives),[1] is an unleavened flatbread originating from the Indian subcontinent and is a staple in India, Nepal, Bangladesh, Pakistan, Kyrgyzstan, Sri Lanka, the Arabian Peninsula, East Africa, and the Caribbean.[2] Chapatis are made of whole-wheat flour known as atta, mixed into dough with water, oil (optional), and salt (optional) in a mixing utensil called a parat, and are cooked on a tava (flat skillet).[3][4] It is a common staple in the Indian subcontinent as well as amongst expatriates from the Indian subcontinent throughout the world. Chapatis were also introduced to other parts of the world by immigrants from the Indian subcontinent, particularly by Indian merchants to Central Asia, Southeast Asia, East Africa, and the Caribbean.[5] The word chapati is derived from the Sanskrit word \u091a\u0930\u094d\u092a\u091f\u0940[6] (charpa\u1e6d\u012b). From a derivative of Sanskrit *\u091a\u0930\u094d\u092a (charpa, \u201cflat\u201d). Chapati is a form of roti or rotta (bread). The words are often used interchangeably. The word chapat (Marathi: \u091a\u093e\u092a\u091f) means \"slap\" or \"flat,\" describing the traditional method of forming round pieces of thin dough by slapping the dough between the wetted palms of the hands. With each slap, the piece of dough is rotated. The word chapati is noted in the 16th-century document Ain-i-Akbari  by Abu'l-Fazl ibn Mubarak, vizier of Mughal Emperor Akbar.[2] Chapatis are one of the most common forms of wheat bread, a staple food in the Indian subcontinent. The carbonized wheat grains discovered at the excavations at Mohenjo-daro are of a similar variety to an endemic species of wheat still found in India. The Indus Valley is known to be one of the ancestral lands of cultivated wheat. Chapatis, along with rotis, were introduced to other parts of the world by immigrants from the Indian subcontinent, particularly by Indian merchants who settled in Southeast Asia and the Caribbean islands.[5] Chapatis are made using a soft dough comprising wheat flour and water.[9] It is more finely ground than most Western-style whole wheat flours. Chapati dough is typically prepared with flour and water, kneaded with the knuckles of the hand made into a fist and left to rest for at least 10 or 15 minutes to an hour for the gluten in the dough to relax. After proofing, the dough becomes softer and more pliable. Small portions of the dough are pinched off and formed into round balls that are pressed between the two palms to form discs which are then dipped into flour and rolled out on a circular rolling board (a chakla), using a rolling pin known as a velan or belan, into a flat disc.[10] There are also automatic roti makers which automate the whole process.[11] The rolled-out dough is then thrown on the preheated dry tava and cooked on both sides. In some regions of the Indian subcontinent chapatis are only partially cooked on the skillet, and then cooked directly over a flame, which makes them puff up. The hot steam cooks the chapati rapidly from the inside. In some parts of northern India and eastern Pakistan, this is called a phulka. In southern parts of India, it is called a pulka. It is also possible to puff up the roti directly on the tava.[12] Once cooked, chapatis are often topped with butter or ghee.[13] In western regions of Maharashtra, some oil is added inside the rolled-out dough and then put on the tava; this is distinct from paratha. Chapati diameter and thickness vary from region to region. Chapatis made in domestic kitchens are usually not larger than 15 centimetres (6\u00a0in) to 18 centimetres (7\u00a0in) in diameter since the tava on which they are made comes in sizes that fit comfortably on a domestic stovetop. Tavas were traditionally made of unglazed earthenware, but are now typically made from metal. The shape of the rolling pin also varies from region to region. Some households simply use a kitchen worktop as a sort of pastry board, but round flat-topped \"boards\" made of wood, stone, or stainless steel are available specifically for rolling out chapatis.[5] In most parts of the Indian subcontinent, there is a distinction made between chapati and other related flatbreads eaten in the region like roti, paratha, kulcha, puri and naan based on cooking technique, texture and use of different types of flours. For example, parathas are either made layered by spreading them with ghee, folding and rolling out again into a disc which turns out flakey once cooked, or are filled with spinach, dal or cooked radish or potato. Parathas are mostly made using all-purpose flour instead of whole wheat flour.[14] There are many regional varieties of chapati in India: In the Maldives, chapatis are traditionally eaten for breakfast along with a dish known as mas huni.[15] Flatbreads are staples of Indian food. Chapatis go well with curries, dry sabzis or sabjis (vegetables cooked in gravy), chutneys or dal.[16]", "Fruitcake": "Fruitcake or fruit cake is a cake made with candied or dried fruit, nuts, and spices, and optionally soaked in spirits. In the United Kingdom, certain rich versions may be iced and decorated. Fruitcakes are usually served in celebration of weddings and Christmas. Given their rich nature, fruitcakes are most often consumed on their own, as opposed to with condiments (such as butter or cream).[1] Fruit cake is different to fruit bread, but may share similar toppings and mixtures. The earliest recipe from ancient Rome lists pomegranate seeds, pine nuts, and raisins that were mixed into barley mash.[2] In the Middle Ages, honey, spices, and preserved fruits were added. Fruitcakes soon proliferated all over Europe. Recipes varied greatly in different countries throughout the ages, depending on the available ingredients as well as (in some instances) church regulations forbidding the use of butter, regarding the observance of Fasting. Pope Innocent VIII (1432\u20131492) finally granted the use of butter, in a written permission known as the \u2018Butter Letter' or Butterbrief in 1490, giving permission to Saxony to use milk and butter in the Stollen fruitcakes.[3] Starting in the 16th century, sugar from the American Colonies (and the discovery that high concentrations of sugar could preserve fruits) created an excess of candied fruit, thus making fruitcakes more affordable and popular.[4] The 17th-century English fruitcake was originally yeast-leavened, and the rum and dried fruit helped extend the shelf life of the cake.[5] In Australia, fruitcake is consumed throughout the year, but most commonly at Christmas, and is available at most major retail outlets. The cake is rarely given icing; often it is consumed with butter or margarine, or custard. In the Bahamas, not only is the fruitcake drenched with rum, but the ingredients are as well. All of the candied fruits, walnuts, and raisins are placed in an enclosed container and are soaked with the darkest variety of rum, anywhere from 2 weeks to 3 months in advance. The cake ingredients are mixed, and once the cake has finished baking, rum is poured onto it while it is still hot. In Bulgaria, the common fruitcake is known as keks (Bulgarian: \u043a\u0435\u043a\u0441 [k\u025bks]), is home-made and is consumed throughout the year. Recipes for keks vary, but commonly it contains flour, butter and/or cooking oil, milk, yeast, yoghurt, eggs, cocoa, walnuts, and raisins. It is usually baked in Bundt-style pans. There is also another specific type of fruitcake prepared for Easter, which is known as kozunak (Bulgarian: \u043a\u043e\u0437\u0443\u043d\u0430\u043a [kozu\u02c8nak]). The fruitcake is commonly eaten during the Christmas season in Canada. Rarely is it seen during other times of the year. The Canadian fruitcake is similar in style to the UK version. However, there is rarely icing on the cake, and alcohol is not commonly put into Christmas cakes that are sold. The cakes are shaped like a small loaf of bread, and often covered in marzipan. Dark, moist and rich Christmas fruitcakes are the most frequently consumed, with white Christmas fruitcake less common. These cakes tend to be made in mid-November to early December when the weather starts to cool down. They are a staple during Christmas dinner and also can be a gift generally exchanged between business associates and close friends/family. It's called g\u00e2teau aux fruits in Quebec and New-Brunswick. Pan de Pascua is a fruitcake traditionally eaten around Christmas and Epiphany. In France, fruitcake is called cake aux fruits confits. In Germany, baked goods which fit the description of fruitcake are not usually regarded as cake but rather as sweet breads. Stollen is loaf-shaped and often powdered with icing sugar on the outside. It is usually made with yeast, butter, water, and flour, with the addition of citrus zest, candied citrus peel, raisins, and almonds. The most famous Stollen is the Dresdner Stollen,[6] sold at the Dresden Christmas market, the Striezelmarkt.\nOfficial Dresden Stollen, produced by only 150 bakers in Dresden and some adjacent settlements, bears a special seal depicting Elector Augustus II the Strong. Typically, it is covered with a crust of compacted  powdered sugar around 1 cm thick, but it is actually defined by its richness in butter and certain fruit and nuts: Per kilogram flour, Dresdner Stollen is mandated by law to contain at least 650 grams sultanas, 500 grams of butter, 200 grams succade, and 150 grams of almonds.[7] The recipe originated in 1491, when after several generations of lobbying by Elector Ernest, Duke Albert III, and their ancestors, Pope Innocent VIII gave an exemption to the Roman Catholic ban on using butter during Lent to Saxon bakers.[8] In Bremen, the local fruitcake called Klaben is traditionally sold and eaten during the Christmas season. Bremer Klaben is a kind of stollen which is not dusted with powdered sugar after baking. Both Dresdner Stollen and Bremen Klaben are protected geographical indications. In Southern Germany and the Alpine region, Fr\u00fcchtebrot (also called Berewecke, Birnenbrot, Hutzenbrot, Hutzelbrot, Kletzenbrot, Schnitzbrot, or Zelten) is a sweet, dark bread baked with nuts and dried fruit, e.g. apricots, figs, dates, plums, etc. Fruitcake is a rich dense cake packed with dry fruits and nuts flavoured with spices usually made during Christmas. In India, this is found everywhere during the Christmas season, although it is also available commonly throughout the year. In Ireland, a type of sweetbread called barmbrack is eaten at Hallowe'en. The cake contains different objects such as a ring or small coin, each signifying a different fortune for the person who finds it. Panforte is a chewy, dense Tuscan fruitcake dating back to 13th-century Siena. Panforte is strongly flavored with spices (panforte means \"strong bread\") and baked in a shallow form. Genoa's fruitcake, a lower, denser but still crumbly variety, is called pandolce (\"sweet bread\"). There are various types of fruitcakes from the Emilia-Romagna region, most being dark and heavily spiced with an abundance of candied fruit and nuts. The certosino from Bologna is a round cake similar to pan forte but with Chinese spices and a variety of whole-halved candied fruit decorating the top; dark chocolate is often added to the dough for a richer flavour. The certosino is low and very dense. Panone, produced in much of Emilia, is similar to the certosino, but with a lighter, fluffier dough and candied fruit inside the cake rather than used as decoration. Panpepato from Ferrara has a dough similar to panone but has a higher ginger content, giving it almost a gingerbread taste. Candied fruit is not often found and instead there is a high concentration of nuts within the dough; the entire cake is often coated in dark chocolate. Gubana is a Christmas/holiday cake from the Friuli-Venezia Giulia region, specifically from the area around Cividale del Friuli. It is a leavened dough cake with a filling of nuts, dried fruit, sugar, and grappa which is rolled into a spiral filled tube which is then twisted into the shape of a rose or snail's shell. Gubana is often eaten with alcohol (slivovitz or grappa) around the holiday season. It combines Italian, Friulan, and Slovenian tastes and cooking styles to make a unique sweet. Panettone is a Milanese sweet bread loaf (widely available throughout Italy and in many other countries), served around Christmas, which is traditionally filled with dried and candied fruits, with a bread loaf consistency. Fruitcakes arrived in New Zealand with early settlers from Britain. Until the 1960s fruitcake was generally homemade, but since then has become commercially widely available in a range of styles. Light coloured fruitcake is often sold as tennis cake or light fruit-cake all year round. Most New Zealand wedding cakes are finely iced and decorated fruitcake often several tiers high. Most fruitcake is eaten in the Christmas period. It is dark, rich and made from multiple dried fruits. Homemade cakes may use brandy or sherry to enhance flavour rather than as a preservative. They may be square or round, iced or uniced. A Christmas cake is usually simply decorated with a Christmas scene or the words Merry Christmas. Keks is a traditional fruitcake eaten during Christmas season. It is a loaf shaped sponge cake with a substantial content of nuts, raisins, figs and candied fruits. Although French in its origin, Bolo Rei is a traditional fruitcake enjoyed during Christmas season and a staple dessert in any Portuguese home during the holidays. Included is the characteristic fava bean and, according to tradition, whoever finds the fava bean has to pay for the cake the following year. Birnenbrot[9] is a dense sweet Swiss fruitcake with candied fruits and nuts. Black cake, is a traditional part of Christmas celebration in the English Caribbean. The cake incorporates a large quantity of mixed fruits and rum/wine and becomes a treasured Christmas treat consumed and given out between the Christmas season and New Year. The fruit, wine and rum is prepared weeks, sometimes months, ahead, and has its origin in the English Christmas pudding, and can be quite expensive. It is very different from a North American fruitcake. In the UK, fruitcakes are made in types ranging from extremely light to rich and moist. The traditional Christmas cake is a round fruitcake covered in marzipan and then in white royal icing or fondant icing. It is often further decorated with snow scenes, holly leaves, and berries (real or artificial), or tiny decorative robins or snowmen. It is also the tradition for a similar kind of cake to be served at weddings. In Yorkshire, fruitcake is often served accompanied with cheese. Fruitcakes in the United Kingdom often contain currants and glace cherries, an example of this type being the Genoa cake. A type of fruitcake which originated in Scotland, the Dundee Cake, owes its name to Keiller's marmalade. It does not contain glace cherries, but is decorated with almonds. Fruitcake was historically referred to as plum cake in England from around 1700.[10] Typical American fruitcakes are rich in fruit and nuts. Mail-order fruitcakes in America began in 1913. Some well-known American bakers of fruitcake include Collin Street Bakery in Corsicana, Texas, and The Claxton Bakery in Claxton, Georgia. Both Collin Street and Claxton are Southern companies with inexpensive access to large quantities of nuts, for which the expression \"nutty as a fruitcake\" was derived in 1935.[4] Commercial fruitcakes are often sold from catalogues by charities as a fund raiser. Fruitcakes are also made and sold by Christian monasteries, as a means of supporting the monks and nuns who reside there. Some well-known American monasteries which offer fruitcake include Abbey of Gethsemani, in Trappist, Kentucky; Assumption Abbey in Ava, Missouri; Monastery of the Holy Spirit, in Conyers, Georgia; and Trappist Abbey in Carlton, Oregon.[11][12] The fruitcake produced by the Trappists of the Abbey of Gethsemani in Trappist, Kentucky earned the \"best overall fruitcake\" accolade from The Wall Street Journal.[13] Most American mass-produced fruitcakes are alcohol-free, but those made according to traditional recipes are saturated with liqueurs or brandy and covered in powdered sugar, both of which prevent mould. Brandy (or wine) soaked linens can be used to store the fruitcakes, and some people feel that fruitcakes improve with age.[citation needed] In the United States, the fruitcake has become a ridiculed dessert, in part due to the mass-produced inexpensive cakes of questionable age. Some attribute the beginning of this trend with The Tonight Show host Johnny Carson.[4] He would joke that there really is only one fruitcake in the world, passed from family to family. After Carson's death, the tradition continued with \"The Fruitcake Lady\" (Marie Rudisill), who made appearances on the show and offered her \"fruitcake\" opinions. In fact, the fruitcake had been a butt of jokes on television programs such as Father Knows Best and The Donna Reed Show years before The Tonight Show debuted and appears to have first become a vilified confection in the early 20th century, as evidenced by Warner Brothers cartoons. It has also been used as a derogatory term for people who are considered weak, strange, or insane. Since 1995, Manitou Springs, Colorado, has hosted the Great Fruitcake Toss on the first Saturday of every January. Leslie Lewis of the Manitou Springs Chamber of Commerce said that they encourage the use of recycled fruitcakes. The all-time Great Fruitcake Toss record is 1,420 feet, set in January 2007 by a group of eight Boeing engineers who built the \"Omega 380\", a mock artillery piece fueled by compressed air pumped by an exercise bike.[14] When a fruitcake contains a good deal of alcohol, it can be preserved for many years. For example, a fruitcake baked in 1878 has been kept as an heirloom by a family in Tecumseh, Michigan; as of 2019, the baker's great-great-granddaughter is the custodian of the cake.[15][16] Wrapping the cake in alcohol-soaked linen before storing is one method of lengthening its shelf life.[citation needed] A 106-year-old fruitcake discovered in 2017 by the Antarctic Heritage Trust was described as in \"excellent condition\" and \"almost\" edible.[17]", "Pindi Chana": "Pindi Hazara Chana (born 24 January 1974) is a Tanzanian CCM politician and a special seat Member of Parliament since 2010.[1] In January 2022 she began her cabinet career as the Minister of State (Policy, Parliamentary Affairs, Labour, Youth, Employment and Persons with Disabilities) in the Prime Minister's Office.[2] Following a mini cabinet re-shuffle on 31st March 2022 Chana assumed the Ministry of Natural Resources & Tourism office.[3] She exchanged positions with Mohamed Mchengerwa following another cabinet reshuffle as the new Minister of Culture, Arts and Sports in February 2023.[4] Again on 1 September 2023 in Samia Suluhu Hassan's third major cabinet reshuffle, she exchanged dockets with Damas Ndumbaro as the new Minister of Constitutional and Legal Affairs.[5]  This article about a Tanzanian politician is a stub.

Cooled", "Poppadoms": " A papadam (also spelled poppadom, among other variants), also known as papad, is a snack that originated in the Indian subcontinent. Dough of black gram bean flour is either deep fried or cooked with dry heat (flipped over an open flame) until crunchy. Other flours made from lentils, chickpeas, rice, tapioca, millet or potato are also used. Papadam is typically served as an accompaniment to a meal in India, Pakistan, Bangladesh, Nepal, Sri Lanka and the Caribbean or as an appetizer, often with a dip such as chutneys, or toppings such as chopped onions and chili peppers, or it may be used as an ingredient in curries. Papadam is a loanword from Tamil \u0baa\u0baa\u0bcd\u0baa\u0b9f\u0bae\u0bcd pappa\u1e6dam,[1][2] and is likely derived from the Sanskrit word parpa\u1e6da (\u092a\u0930\u094d\u092a\u091f), meaning a flattened disc described in early Jain and Buddhist literature.[3][4] Papad is known by several names in the various languages of India, e.g. appadam (\u0c05\u0c2a\u0c4d\u0c2a\u0c21\u0c02) in Telugu; appalam (\u0b85\u0baa\u0bcd\u0baa\u0bb3\u0bae\u0bcd) or pappa\u1e6dam (\u0baa\u0baa\u0bcd\u0baa\u0b9f\u0bae\u0bcd) in Tamil; happala in Kannada; papadam (\u0db4\u0db4\u0da9\u0db8\u0dca) in Sinhala; pappadam in Malayalam; papad in Marathi,[5] Punjabi and Gujarati; and pampad (\u0b2a\u0b3e\u0b2e\u0b4d\u0b2a\u0b21) in Odia.[citation needed] Papad recipes vary from region to region and from household to household. They are typically made from a flour or paste derived from lentils, chickpeas, black gram, rice, or potatoes.[6] Salt and peanut oil are added to make a dough, which can be flavored with seasonings such as chili, cumin, garlic, or black pepper. Sometimes, baking soda or slaked lime are also added. The dough is shaped into thin, round flatbreads, dried (traditionally in the sun[7]), and can be cooked by deep frying, roasting over an open flame, toasting, or microwaving, depending on the desired texture. In most Indian restaurants around the world, they are served as an appetizer with dips, which often include mango chutney, lime pickle, onion chutney, and raita.[8] Masala papad with sev, onion, tomato and coriander leaves is one of India's most popular appetizers. Papadam can be prepared from different ingredients and methods. One popular recipe uses flour ground from hulled split black gram[9] mixed with black pepper, salt, a small amount of vegetable oil and a food-grade alkali, and the mixture is kneaded. A well-kneaded dough is then flattened into very thin rounds and then dried and stored for later preparation and consumption. It may also contain rice, jackfruit, sago, etc., as main ingredients. Cracked black pepper, red chili powder, asafoetida, cumin or sesame seeds are often used as flavoring agents. Papadam is also made from rice flakes, ragi or horsegram.[10]", "Chappati": " Chapati (alternatively spelled chapathi; pronounced as IAST: cap\u0101t\u012b, cap\u0101\u1e6d\u012b, c\u0101p\u0101\u1e6di), also known as roti, rooti, rotee, rotli,  rotta, safati, shabaati, phulka (in Marathi),  chapo (in East Africa), sada roti (in the Caribbean), poli, and roshi (in the Maldives),[1] is an unleavened flatbread originating from the Indian subcontinent and is a staple in India, Nepal, Bangladesh, Pakistan, Kyrgyzstan, Sri Lanka, the Arabian Peninsula, East Africa, and the Caribbean.[2] Chapatis are made of whole-wheat flour known as atta, mixed into dough with water, oil (optional), and salt (optional) in a mixing utensil called a parat, and are cooked on a tava (flat skillet).[3][4] It is a common staple in the Indian subcontinent as well as amongst expatriates from the Indian subcontinent throughout the world. Chapatis were also introduced to other parts of the world by immigrants from the Indian subcontinent, particularly by Indian merchants to Central Asia, Southeast Asia, East Africa, and the Caribbean.[5] The word chapati is derived from the Sanskrit word \u091a\u0930\u094d\u092a\u091f\u0940[6] (charpa\u1e6d\u012b).

Chapatis go well with curries, dry sabzis or sabjis (vegetables cooked in gravy), chutneys or dal.[16]", "Tomato": " The tomato (/t\u0259me\u026ato\u028a/ or /t\u0259m\u0251\u02d0to\u028a/) is the edible berry of the plant Solanum lycopersicum,[1][2] commonly known as the tomato plant. The species originated in western South America, Mexico, and Central America.[2][3] Its domestication and use as a cultivated food may have originated with the indigenous peoples of Mexico.[2][4] The Aztecs used tomatoes in their cooking at the time of the Spanish conquest of the Aztec Empire, and after the Spanish encountered the tomato for the first time after their contact with the Aztecs, they brought the plant to Europe, in a widespread cultural interchange known as the Columbian exchange. From there, the tomato was introduced to other parts of the European-colonized world during the 16th century.[2] Tomatoes are a significant source of umami flavor.[5] They are consumed in diverse ways: raw or cooked, and in many dishes, sauces, salads, and drinks. While tomatoes are fruits\u2014botanically classified as berries\u2014they are commonly used culinarily as a vegetable ingredient or side dish.[3] Numerous varieties of the tomato plant are widely grown in temperate climates across the world, with greenhouses allowing for the production of tomatoes throughout all seasons of the year. Tomato plants typically grow to 1\u20133 meters (3\u201310\u00a0ft) in height. They are vines that have a weak stem that sprawls and typically needs support.[2] Indeterminate tomato plants are perennials in their native habitat, but are cultivated as annuals. (Determinate, or bush, plants are annuals that stop growing at a certain height and produce a crop all at once.) The size of the tomato varies according to the cultivar, with a range of 1\u201310\u00a0cm (1\u20442\u20134\u00a0in) in width.[2] The wild ancestor of the tomato, Solanum pimpinellifolium, is native to western South America.[6] These wild versions were the size of peas.[6] The first evidence of domestication points to the Aztecs and other peoples in Mesoamerica, who used the fruit fresh and in their cooking. The Spanish first introduced tomatoes to Europe, where they became used in Spanish food. In France, Italy and northern Europe, the tomato was initially grown as an ornamental plant. It was regarded with suspicion as a food because botanists recognized it as a nightshade, a relative of the poisonous belladonna.[3] This was exacerbated by the interaction of the tomato's acidic juice with pewter plates.[7] The leaves and fruit contain tomatine, which in large quantities would be toxic. However, the ripe fruit contains a much lower amount of tomatine than the immature fruit.[8] The exact date of domestication is unknown; by 500 BC, it was already being cultivated in southern Mexico and probably other areas.[9]:\u200a13\u200a The Pueblo people are thought to have believed that those who witnessed the ingestion of tomato seeds were blessed with powers of divination.[10] The large, lumpy variety of tomato, a mutation from a smoother, smaller fruit, originated in Mesoamerica, and may be the direct ancestor of some modern cultivated tomatoes.[9]:\u200a15 The Aztecs raised several varieties of tomato, with red tomatoes called xitomatl and green tomatoes (physalis) called tomatl (tomatillo).[11] Bernardino de Sahag\u00fan reported seeing a great variety of tomatoes in the Aztec market at Tenochtitl\u00e1n (Mexico City): \"large tomatoes, small tomatoes, leaf tomatoes, sweet tomatoes, large serpent tomatoes, nipple-shaped tomatoes\", and tomatoes of all colors from the brightest red to the deepest yellow.[12] Bernardino de Sahag\u00fan mentioned Aztecs cooking various sauces, some with and without tomatoes of different sizes, serving them in city markets: \"foods sauces, hot sauces; fried [food], olla-cooked [food], juices, sauces of juices, shredded [food] with chile, with squash seeds [most likely Cucurbita pepo], with tomatoes, with smoked chile, with hot chile, with yellow chile, with mild red chile sauce, yellow chile sauce, hot chile sauce, with \"bird excrement\" sauce, sauce of smoked chile, heated [sauces], bean sauce; [he sells] toasted beans, cooked beans, mushroom sauce, sauce of small squash, sauce of large tomatoes, sauce of ordinary tomatoes, sauce of various kinds of sour herbs, avocado sauce.\"[13] Spanish conquistador Hern\u00e1n Cort\u00e9s may have been the first to transfer a small yellow tomato to Europe after he captured the Aztec city of Tenochtitlan, now Mexico City, in 1521. The earliest discussion of the tomato in European literature appeared in a herbal written in 1544 by Pietro Andrea Mattioli, an Italian physician and botanist, who suggested that a new type of eggplant had been brought to Italy that was blood red or golden color when mature and could be divided into segments and eaten like an eggplant\u2014that is, cooked and seasoned with salt, black pepper, and oil. It was not until ten years later that tomatoes were named in print by Mattioli as pomi d'oro, or \"golden apples\".[9]:\u200a13 After the Spanish colonization of the Americas, the Spanish distributed the tomato throughout their colonies in the Caribbean. They also took it to the Philippines, from where it spread to southeast Asia and then the entire Asian continent. The Spanish also brought the tomato to Europe. It grew easily in Mediterranean climates, and cultivation began in the 1540s. It was probably eaten shortly after it was introduced, and was certainly being used as food by the early 17th century in Spain. The tomato was introduced to China, likely via the Philippines or Macau, in the 1500s. It was given the name \u756a\u8304 f\u0101nqi\u00e9 (foreign eggplant), as the Chinese named many foodstuffs introduced from abroad, but referring specifically to early introductions.[14] The recorded history of tomatoes in Italy dates back to at least 31 October 1548, when the house steward of Cosimo de' Medici, the grand duke of Tuscany, wrote to the Medici private secretary informing him that the basket of tomatoes sent from the grand duke's Florentine estate at Torre del Gallo \"had arrived safely\".[15] Tomatoes were grown mainly as ornamentals early on after their arrival in Italy. For example, the Florentine aristocrat Giovanvettorio Soderini wrote how they \"were to be sought only for their beauty\", and were grown only in gardens or flower beds. The tomato's ability to mutate and create new and different varieties helped contribute to its success and spread throughout Italy. However, in areas where the climate supported growing tomatoes, their habit of growing to the ground suggested low status. They were not adopted as a staple of the peasant population because they were not as filling as other fruits already available. Additionally, both toxic and inedible varieties discouraged many people from attempting to consume or prepare any other varieties.[16] In certain areas of Italy, such as Florence, the fruit was used solely as a tabletop decoration, until it was incorporated into the local cuisine in the late 17th or early 18th century.[17] The earliest discovered cookbook with tomato recipes was published in Naples in 1692, though the author had apparently obtained these recipes from Spanish sources.[9]:\u200a17 Unique varieties were developed over the next several hundred years for uses such as dried tomatoes, sauce tomatoes, pizza tomatoes, and tomatoes for long-term storage. These varieties are usually known for their place of origin as much as by a variety name. For example there is the Pomodorino del Piennolo del Vesuvio, the \"hanging tomato of Vesuvius\", or the well known and highly prized San Marzano plum tomato grown in that region.[This paragraph needs citation(s)] Tomatoes were not grown in England until the 1590s. One of the earliest cultivators was John Gerard, a barber-surgeon. Gerard's Herbal, published in 1597, and largely plagiarized from continental sources, is also one of the earliest discussions of the tomato in England. Gerard knew the tomato was eaten in Spain and Italy. Nonetheless, he believed it was poisonous. (In fact, the plant and raw fruit do have low levels of tomatine, but are not generally dangerous. See below.) Gerard's views were influential, and the tomato was considered unfit for eating (though not necessarily poisonous) for many years in Britain and its North American colonies.[9]:\u200a17 However, by the mid-18th century, tomatoes were widely eaten in Britain, and before the end of that century, the Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica stated the tomato was \"in daily use\" in soups, broths, and as a garnish. They were not part of the average person's diet, and though by 1820 they were described as \"to be seen in great abundance in all our vegetable markets\" and to be \"used by all our best cooks\", reference was made to their cultivation in gardens still \"for the singularity of their appearance\", while their use in cooking was associated with exotic Italian or Jewish cuisine.[18] For example, in Elizabeth Blackwell's A Curious Herbal, it is described under the name \"Love Apple (Amoris Pomum)\" as being consumed with oil and vinegar in Italy, similar to consumption of cucumbers in the UK.[19] The tomato was introduced to cultivation in the Middle East by John Barker, British consul in Aleppo c.\u20091799 to 1825.[20][21] Nineteenth century descriptions of its consumption are uniformly as an ingredient in a cooked dish. In 1881, it is described as only eaten in the region \"within the last forty years\".[22] Today, the tomato is a crucial and ubiquitous part of Middle Eastern cuisine, served fresh in salads (e.g., Arab salad, Israeli salad, Shirazi salad and Turkish salad), grilled with kebabs and other dishes, made into sauces, and so on.[23] The earliest reference to tomatoes being grown in British North America is from 1710, when herbalist William Salmon reported seeing them in what is today South Carolina.[9]:\u200a25\u200a They may have been introduced from the Caribbean. By the mid-18th century, they were cultivated on some Carolina plantations, and probably in other parts of the Southeast as well. Thomas Jefferson, who ate tomatoes in Paris, sent some seeds back to America.[9]:\u200a28\u200a Some early American advocates of the culinary use of the tomato included Michele Felice Corn\u00e8 and Robert Gibbon Johnson.[24] Many Americans considered tomatoes to be poisonous at this time and, in general, they were grown more as ornamental plants than as food. In 1897, W. H. Garrison addressed the Medico-Legal Society of New York stating, \"The belief\nwas once transmitted that the tomato was sinisterly dangerous.\" He recalled in his youth tomatoes were dubbed \"love-apples or wolf-apples\" and they were shunned as \"globes of the devil.\"[25] Alexander W. Livingston receives much credit for developing numerous varieties of tomato for both home and commercial gardeners.[26] Early tomato breeders included Henry Tilden in Iowa and a Dr. Hand in Baltimore.[27]\nThe U.S. Department of Agriculture's 1937 yearbook declared that \"half of the major varieties were a result of the abilities of the Livingstons to evaluate and perpetuate superior material in the tomato.\" Livingston's first breed of tomato, the Paragon, was introduced in 1870, the beginning of a great tomato culture enterprise in the county. In 1875, he introduced the Acme, which was said to be involved in the parentage of most of the tomatoes introduced by him and his competitors for the next twenty-five years.[28][29] When Livingston began his attempts to develop the tomato as a commercial crop, his aim had been to grow tomatoes smooth in contour, uniform in size, and sweet in flavor. He eventually developed over seventeen different varieties of the tomato plant.[28] Today, the crop is grown in every state in the Union.[30] Because of the long growing season needed for this heat-loving crop, several states in the US Sun Belt became major tomato-producers, particularly Florida and California. In California, tomatoes are grown under irrigation for both the fresh fruit market and for canning and processing. The University of California, Davis (UC Davis) became a major center for research on the tomato. The C.M. Rick Tomato Genetics Resource Center at UC Davis is a gene bank of wild relatives, monogenic mutants and miscellaneous genetic stocks of tomato.[31] The center is named for the late Dr. Charles M. Rick, a pioneer in tomato genetics research.[32] Research on processing tomatoes is also conducted by the California Tomato Research Institute in Escalon, California.[33] In California, growers have used a method of cultivation called dry-farming, especially with Early Girl tomatoes. This technique encourages the plant to send roots deep to find existing moisture in soil that retains moisture, such as clayey soil. The poor taste and lack of sugar in modern garden and commercial tomato varieties resulted from breeding tomatoes to ripen uniformly red. This change occurred after discovery of a mutant \"u\" phenotype in the mid-20th century, so named because the fruits ripened uniformly. This was widely cross-bred to produce red fruit without the typical green ring around the stem on un-crossbred varieties. Prior to general introduction of this trait, most tomatoes produced more sugar during ripening, and were sweeter and more flavorful.[34][35] Evidence has been found that 10\u201320% of the total carbon fixed in the fruit can be produced by photosynthesis in the developing fruit of the normal U phenotype. The u genetic mutation encodes a factor that produces defective chloroplasts with lower density in developing fruit, resulting in a lighter green colour of unripe fruit, and repression of sugars accumulation in the resulting ripe fruit by 10\u201315%. Perhaps more important than their role in photosynthesis, the fruit chloroplasts are remodelled during ripening into chlorophyll-free chromoplasts that synthesize and accumulate the carotenoids lycopene, \u03b2-carotene, and other metabolites that are sensory and nutritional assets of the ripe fruit. The potent chloroplasts in the dark-green shoulders of the U phenotype are beneficial here, but have the disadvantage of leaving green shoulders near the stems of the ripe fruit, and even cracked yellow shoulders, apparently because of oxidative stress due to overload of the photosynthetic chain in direct sunlight at high temperatures. Hence genetic design of a commercial variety that combines the advantages of types u and U requires fine tuning, but may be feasible.[36] Furthermore, breeders of modern tomato cultivars typically strive to produce tomato plants exhibiting improved yield, shelf life, size, and tolerance/resistance to various environmental pressures, including disease.[37][38] However, these breeding efforts have yielded unintended negative consequences on various tomato fruit attributes. For instance, linkage drag is a phenomenon that has been responsible for alterations in the metabolism of the tomato fruit. Linkage drag describes the introduction of an undesired trait or allele into a plant during backcrossing. This trait/allele is physically linked (or is very close) to the desired allele along the chromosome. In introducing the beneficial allele, there exists a high likelihood that the poor allele is also incorporated into the plant. Thus, breeding efforts attempting to enhance certain traits (for example: larger fruit size) have unintentionally altered production of chemicals associated with, for instance, nutritional value and flavor.[37] Breeders have turned to using wild tomato species as a source of alleles for the introduction of beneficial traits into modern tomato varieties. For example, wild tomato relatives may possess higher amounts of fruit solids (which are associated with greater sugar content) or resistance to diseases caused by microbes, such as resistance towards the early blight pathogen Alternaria solani. However, this tactic has limitations, for the incorporation of certain traits, such as pathogen resistance, can negatively impact other favorable phenotypes, such as fruit production.[38][39] The word tomato comes from the Spanish tomate, which in turn comes from the Nahuatl word tomatl [\u02c8tomat\u0361\u026c] pronunciation\u24d8, meaning \"swelling fruit\".[40] The specific name lycopersicum, meaning \"wolf peach\", originated with Galen, who used it to denote a plant that has not been identified. Luigi Anguillara speculated in the 16th century that Galen's lycopersicum might be the tomato, and despite the impossibility of this identification, lyocpersicum entered scientific use as a name for the fruit.[41] The usual pronunciations of tomato are /t\u0259\u02c8me\u026ato\u028a/ t\u0259-MAY-toh (usual in North American English) and /t\u0259\u02c8m\u0251\u02d0to\u028a/ t\u0259-MAH-toh (usual in British English).[42] The word's dual pronunciations were immortalized in Ira and George Gershwin's 1937 song \"Let's Call the Whole Thing Off\" (\"You like /p\u0259\u02c8te\u026ato\u028a/ and I like /p\u0259\u02c8t\u0251\u02d0to\u028a/ / You like /t\u0259\u02c8me\u026ato\u028a/ and I like /t\u0259\u02c8m\u0251\u02d0to\u028a/\") and have become a symbol for nitpicking pronunciation disputes.[citation needed] In this capacity, it has even become an American and British slang term: saying \"/t\u0259\u02c8me\u026ato\u028a t\u0259\u02c8m\u0251\u02d0to\u028a/\" when presented with two choices can mean \"What's the difference?\" or \"It's all the same to me\".[43] Tomato plants are vines, initially decumbent, and could grow up to 3 m, although erect bush varieties have been bred, generally 100\u00a0cm (3\u00a0ft 3\u00a0in) tall or shorter. Indeterminate types are \"tender\" perennials, dying annually in temperate climates (they are originally native to tropical highlands), although they can live up to three years in a greenhouse in some cases. Determinate types are annual in all climates.[44] Tomato plants are dicots, and grow as a series of branching stems, with a terminal bud at the tip that does the actual growing. When the tip eventually stops growing, whether because of pruning or flowering, lateral buds take over and grow into other, fully functional, vines.[45] Tomato vines are typically pubescent, meaning covered with fine short hairs. The hairs facilitate the vining process, turning into roots wherever the plant is in contact with the ground and moisture, especially if the vine's connection to its original root has been damaged or severed.[citation needed] Most tomato plants have compound leaves, and are called regular leaf (RL) plants, but some cultivars have simple leaves known as potato leaf (PL) style because of their resemblance to that particular relative. Of RL plants, there are variations, such as rugose leaves, which are deeply grooved, and variegated, angora leaves, which have additional colors where a genetic mutation causes chlorophyll to be excluded from some portions of the leaves.[46][unreliable source?] The leaves are 10\u201325\u00a0cm (4\u201310\u00a0in) long, odd pinnate, with five to nine leaflets on petioles,[47] each leaflet up to 8\u00a0cm (3\u00a0in) long, with a serrated margin; both the stem and leaves are densely glandular-hairy.[citation needed] Their flowers, appearing on the apical meristem, have the anthers fused along the edges, forming a column surrounding the pistil's style. Flowers are bisexual and able to self fertilise. The anthers bend into a cone-like structure, surrounding the stigma.[48] The flowers are 1\u20132\u00a0cm (1\u20442\u20133\u20444\u00a0in) across, yellow, with five pointed lobes on the corolla; they are borne in a cyme of three to 12 together.[citation needed] Although in culinary terms, tomato is regarded as a vegetable, its fruit is classified botanically as a berry.[49] As a true fruit, it develops from the ovary of the plant after fertilization, its flesh comprising the pericarp walls. The fruit contains hollow spaces full of seeds and moisture, called locular cavities. These vary, among cultivated species, according to type. Some smaller varieties have two cavities, globe-shaped varieties typically have three to five, beefsteak tomatoes have a great number of smaller cavities, while paste tomatoes have very few, very small cavities.[50][51][52] For propagation, the seeds need to come from a mature fruit, and must be lightly fermented to remove the gelatinous outer coating and then dried before use.[53] In 1753, Linnaeus placed the tomato in the genus Solanum (alongside the potato) as Solanum lycopersicum. In 1768, Philip Miller moved it to its own genus, naming it Lycopersicon esculentum.[54] The name came into wide use, but was technically in breach of the plant naming rules because Linnaeus's species name lycopersicum still had priority. Although the name Lycopersicum lycopersicum was suggested by Karsten (1888), it is not used because it violates the International Code of Nomenclature[55] barring the use of tautonyms in botanical nomenclature. The corrected name Lycopersicon lycopersicum (Nicolson 1974) was technically valid, because Miller's genus name and Linnaeus's species name differ in exact spelling, but since Lycopersicon esculentum has become so well known, it was officially listed as a nomen conservandum in 1983, and would be the correct name for the tomato in classifications which do not place the tomato in the genus Solanum.[citation needed] Genetic evidence has now shown that Linnaeus was correct to put the tomato in the genus Solanum, making Solanum lycopersicum the correct name.[1][56] Both names, however, will probably be found in the literature for some time. Two of the major reasons for considering the genera separate are the leaf structure (tomato leaves are markedly different from any other Solanum), and the biochemistry (many of the alkaloids common to other Solanum species are conspicuously absent from the tomato). On the other hand, hybrids of tomato and diploid potato can be created in the lab by somatic fusion, and are partially fertile,[57] providing evidence of the close relationship between these species. An international consortium of researchers from 10 countries, began sequencing the tomato genome in 2004.[58][59] A prerelease version of the genome was made available in December 2009.[60] The complete genome for the cultivar Heinz 1706 was published on 31 May 2012 in Nature.[61] The latest reference genome published in 2021 had 799 MB and encodes 34,384 (predicted) proteins, spread over 12 chromosomes.[62] Since many other fruits, like strawberries, apples, melons, and bananas share the same characteristics and genes, researchers stated the published genome could help to improve food quality, food security and reduce costs of all of these fruits.[63] The first commercially available genetically modified food was a tomato called Flavr Savr, which was engineered to have a longer shelf life.[64] However, it is no longer commercially available. Scientists are continuing to develop tomatoes with new traits not found in natural crops, such as increased resistance to pests or environmental stresses or better flavor.[citation needed] The Tomato Genetic Resource Center, Germplasm Resources Information Network, AVRDC, and numerous seed banks around the world store seed representing genetic variations of value to modern agriculture. These seed stocks are available for legitimate breeding and research efforts. While individual breeding efforts can produce useful results, the bulk of tomato breeding work is at universities and major agriculture-related corporations. These efforts have resulted in significant regionally adapted breeding lines and hybrids, such as the Mountain series from North Carolina. Corporations including Heinz, Monsanto, BHNSeed, and Bejoseed have breeding programs that attempt to improve production, size, shape, color, flavor, disease tolerance, pest tolerance, nutritional value, and numerous other traits.[citation needed] Botanically, a tomato is a fruit\u2014a berry, consisting of the ovary, together with its seeds, of a flowering plant.[65] However, the tomato is considered a \"culinary vegetable\" because it has a much lower sugar content than culinary fruits; because it is more savoury (umami) than sweet, it is typically served as part of a salad or main course of a meal, rather than as a dessert.[66] Tomatoes are not the only food source with this ambiguity; bell peppers, cucumbers, green beans, aubergines/eggplants, avocados, and squashes of all kinds (such as courgettes/zucchini and pumpkins) are all botanically fruit, yet cooked as vegetables.[67] The confusion on whether tomatoes are fruits or vegetables has led to legal dispute in the United States. In 1887, U.S. tariff laws that imposed a duty on vegetables, but not on fruit, caused the tomato's status to become a matter of legal importance. In Nix v. Hedden, the U.S. Supreme Court settled the tariff controversy on 10 May 1893, by declaring that the tomato is a vegetable, based on the popular definition that classifies vegetables by use\u2014they are generally served with dinner and not dessert.[68] The holding of this case applies only to the interpretation of the Tariff of 1883, and the court did not purport to reclassify the tomato for botanical or other purposes. The tomato is grown worldwide for its edible fruits, with thousands of cultivars.[69] A fertilizer with an NPK ratio of 5\u201310\u201310 is often sold as tomato fertilizer or vegetable fertilizer,[citation needed] although manure and compost are also used.[citation needed] On average there are 150,000 seeds in a pound of tomato seeds.[70] Tomato cultivars vary widely in their resistance to disease. Modern hybrids focus on improving disease resistance over the heirloom plants. Various forms of mildew and blight are common tomato afflictions, which is why tomato cultivars are often marked with a combination of letters that refer to specific disease resistance. The most common letters are: A common tomato disease is tobacco mosaic virus. Handling cigarettes and other infected tobacco products can transmit the virus to tomato plants.[72] Another particularly dreaded disease is curly top, carried by the beet leafhopper, which interrupts the lifecycle. As the name implies, it has the symptom of making the top leaves of the plant wrinkle up and grow abnormally.[citation needed] Bacterial wilt is another common disease impacting yield.[73] Wang et al., 2019 found phage combination therapies to reduce the impact of bacterial wilt, sometimes by reducing bacterial abundance and sometimes by selecting for resistant but slow growing genetics.[73] Some common tomato pests are the tomato bug, stink bugs, cutworms, tomato hornworms and tobacco hornworms, aphids, cabbage loopers, whiteflies, tomato fruitworms, flea beetles, red spider mite, slugs,[74] and Colorado potato beetles. The tomato russet mite, Aculops lycopersici, feeds on foliage and young fruit of tomato plants, causing shrivelling and necrosis of leaves, flowers, and fruit, possibly killing the plant.[75] After an insect attack tomato plants produce systemin, a plant peptide hormone. Systemin activates defensive mechanisms, such as the production of protease inhibitors to slow the growth of insects. The hormone was first identified in tomatoes, but similar proteins have been identified in other species since.[76] Although not a disease as such, irregular supplies of water can cause growing or ripening fruit to split. Besides cosmetic damage, the splits may allow decay to start, although growing fruits have some ability to heal after a split. In addition, a deformity called cat-facing can be caused by pests, temperature stress, or poor soil conditions. Affected fruit usually remains edible, but its appearance may be unsightly. Tomatoes serve, or are served by, a large variety of companion plants. The devastating tomato hornworm has a major predator in various parasitic wasps, whose larvae devour the hornworm, but whose adult form drinks nectar from tiny-flowered plants like umbellifers. Several species of umbellifer are therefore often grown with tomato plants, including parsley, Queen Anne's lace, and occasionally dill. These also attract predatory flies that attack various tomato pests.[77] Borage is thought to repel the tomato hornworm moth.[78] Basil is popularly recommended as a companion plant to the tomato. Common claims are that basil may deter pests or improve tomato flavor. However, in double-blind taste tests, basil did not significantly affect the taste of tomatoes when planted adjacent to them.[79][80] Tomato plants can protect asparagus from asparagus beetles, because they contain solanine that kills this pest,[citation needed] while asparagus plants contain asparagusic acid that repels nematodes known to attack tomato plants.[81] Marigolds also repel nematodes.[82][83][84] In the wild, original state, tomatoes required cross-pollination; they were much more self-incompatible than domestic cultivars. As a floral device to reduce selfing, the pistil of wild tomatoes extends farther out of the flower than today's cultivars. The stamens were, and remain, entirely within the closed corolla. As tomatoes were moved from their native areas, their traditional pollinators (probably a species of halictid bee) did not move with them.[85] The trait of self-fertility became an advantage, and domestic cultivars of tomato have been selected to maximize this trait.[85] This is not the same as self-pollination, despite the common claim that tomatoes do so. That tomatoes pollinate themselves poorly without outside aid is clearly shown in greenhouse situations, where pollination must be aided by artificial wind, vibration of the plants (one brand of vibrator is a wand called an \"electric bee\" that is used manually), or more often today, by cultured bumblebees.[86] The anther of a tomato flower is shaped like a hollow tube, with the pollen produced within the structure, rather than on the surface, as in most species. The pollen moves through pores in the anther, but very little pollen is shed without some kind of externally-induced motion. The ideal vibratory frequencies to release pollen grains are provided by an insect, such as a bumblebee, or the original wild halictid pollinator, capable of engaging in a behavior known as buzz pollination, which honey bees cannot perform. In an outdoors setting, wind or animals usually provide sufficient motion to produce commercially viable crops.[citation needed] Pollination and fruit formation depend on meiosis. Meiosis is central to the processes by which diploid microspore mother cells within the anther give rise to haploid pollen grains, and megaspore mother cells in ovules that are contained within the ovary give rise to haploid nuclei. Union of haploid nuclei from pollen and ovule (fertilization) can occur either by self- or cross-pollination. Fertilization leads to the formation of a diploid zygote that can then develop into an embryo within the emerging seed. Repeated fertilizations within the ovary are accompanied by maturation of the ovary to form the tomato fruit. Homologs of the recA gene, including rad51, play a key role in homologous recombinational repair of DNA during meiosis. A rad51 homolog is present in the anther of tomato (Lycopersicon esculentum),[87] suggesting that recombinational repair occurs during meiosis in tomato. Tomatoes are often grown in greenhouses in cooler climates, and cultivars such as the British 'Moneymaker' and a number of cultivars grown in Siberia are specifically bred for indoor growing. In more temperate climates, it is not uncommon to start seeds in greenhouses during the late winter for future transplant. Greenhouse tomato production in large-acreage commercial greenhouses and owner-operator stand-alone or multiple-bay greenhouses is on the increase, providing fruit during those times of the year when field-grown fruit is not readily available. Smaller sized fruit (cherry and grape), or cluster tomatoes (fruit-on-the-vine) are the fruit of choice for the large commercial greenhouse operators while the beefsteak varieties are the choice of owner-operator growers.[88] Hydroponic technique is often used in hostile growing environments, as well as high-density plantings. To facilitate transportation and storage, tomatoes are often picked unripe (green) and ripened in storage with ethylene.[89] A machine-harvestable variety of tomato (the \"square tomato\") was developed in the 1950s by University of California, Davis's Gordie C. Hanna, which, in combination with the development of a suitable harvester, revolutionized the tomato-growing industry. This type of tomato is grown commercially near plants that process and can tomatoes, tomato sauce, and tomato paste. They are harvested when ripe and are flavorful when picked. They are harvested 24 hours a day, seven days a week during a 12- to 14-week season, and immediately transported to packing plants, which operate on the same schedule. California is a center of this sort of commercial tomato production and produces about a third of the processed tomatoes produced in the world.[90] In 1994, Calgene introduced a genetically modified tomato called the FlavrSavr, which could be vine ripened without compromising shelf life. However, the product was not commercially successful, and was sold only until 1997.[91] The world dedicated 4.8 million hectares in 2012 for tomato cultivation and the total production was about 161.8 million tonnes.[92] The average world farm yield for tomato was 33.6 tonnes per hectare in 2012.[92] Tomato farms in the Netherlands were the most productive in 2012, with a nationwide average of 476 tonnes per hectare, followed by Belgium (463 tonnes per hectare) and Iceland (429 tonnes per hectare).[93] As of 2008[update], the heaviest tomato harvested weighed 3.51\u00a0kg (7\u00a0lb 12\u00a0oz), was of the cultivar \"Delicious\", and was grown by Gordon Graham of Edmond, Oklahoma in 1986.[94][unreliable source?] The largest tomato plant grown was of the cultivar \"Sungold\" and reached 19.8\u00a0m (65\u00a0ft) in length, grown by Nutriculture Ltd (UK) of Mawdesley, Lancashire, UK, in 2000.[95] A massive \"tomato tree\" growing inside the Walt Disney World Resort's experimental greenhouses in Lake Buena Vista, Florida may have been the largest single tomato plant in the world. The plant has been recognized as a Guinness World Record Holder, with a harvest of more than 32,000 tomatoes and a total weight of 522\u00a0kg (1,151\u00a0lb).[96] It yielded thousands of tomatoes at one time from a single vine. Yong Huang, Epcot's manager of agricultural science, discovered the unique plant in Beijing, China. Huang brought its seeds to Epcot and created the specialized greenhouse for the fruit to grow. The vine grew golf ball-sized tomatoes, which were served at Walt Disney World restaurants.[97] The tree developed a disease and was removed in April 2010 after about 13 months of life.[original research] In 2022, world production of tomatoes was 186 million tonnes, with China accounting for 37% of the total, followed by India, Turkey, and the United States as major producers (table). The leaves, stem, and green unripe fruit of the tomato plant contain small amounts of the alkaloid tomatine, whose effect on humans has not been studied.[8] They also contain small amounts of solanine, a toxic alkaloid found in potato leaves and other plants in the nightshade family.[99][100] However, solanine concentrations in foliage and green fruit are generally too small to be dangerous unless large amounts are consumed\u2014for example, as greens. Small amounts of tomato foliage are sometimes used for flavoring without ill effect, and the green fruit of unripe red tomato varieties is sometimes used for cooking, particularly as fried green tomatoes.[8] There are also tomato varieties with fully ripe fruit that is still green. Compared to potatoes, the amount of solanine in unripe green or fully ripe tomatoes is low. However, even in the case of potatoes, while solanine poisoning resulting from dosages several times the normal human consumption has been demonstrated, actual cases of poisoning from excessive consumption of potatoes are rare.[100] Tomato plants can be toxic to dogs if they eat large amounts of the fruit, or chew plant material.[101] Tomatoes were linked to seven Salmonella outbreaks between 1990 and 2005,[102] and may have been the cause of a salmonellosis outbreak causing 172 illnesses in 18 US states in 2006.[103] The 2008 United States salmonellosis outbreak caused the temporary removal of tomatoes from stores and restaurants across the United States and parts of Canada,[104] although other foods, including jalape\u00f1o and serrano peppers, may have been involved. Though it is botanically a berry, a subset of fruit, the tomato is considered a vegetable for culinary purposes. It has a strong savoury umami flavour, rather than significant sweetness (see above). Chef Heston Blumenthal observed that the inner pulp had more flavour that the flesh; a subsequent academic study in which he participated confirmed that the pulp had up to eleven times more glutamic acid, which carries umami flavour, than the flesh.[105] Although tomatoes originated in the Americas, the tomato is now grown and eaten around the world. It is used in diverse ways, including raw in salads or in slices, stewed, incorporated into a wide variety of dishes, or processed into ketchup or tomato soup. Unripe green tomatoes can also be breaded and fried, used to make salsa, or pickled. Tomato juice is sold as a drink, and is used in cocktails such as the Bloody Mary. Tomatoes have become extensively used in Mediterranean cuisine as a key ingredient in pizza and many pasta sauces.[5] Tomatoes are also used in Spanish and Catalan dishes, such as gazpacho and pa amb tom\u00e0quet. Tomatoes keep best unwashed at room temperature and out of direct sunlight. It is not recommended to refrigerate them as they take a mealy texture and lose flavour.[106][107] Storing stem down can prolong shelf life,[108] as it may keep from rotting too quickly.[109] Unripe tomatoes can be kept in a paper bag to ripen.[110] Tomatoes are easy to preserve whole, chopped, or as tomato sauce or concentrated paste by home canning. The fruit can also be preserved by drying, sometimes in the sun where climate permits, and sold either in bags or in jars with oil. A raw tomato is 95% water, contains 4% carbohydrates, and has less than 1% each of fat and protein (see table). 100 grams (3.5\u00a0oz) of raw tomatoes supply 18 kilocalories and are a moderate source of vitamin C (17% of the Daily Value), but otherwise have low micronutrient content (table). An extensive review in 2022 found and specified many health benefits associated with eating tomatoes, and some risks, due both to external factors (pesticides, microbial contamination, heavy metals from contaminated soil), and intrinsic; for example, lycopene, at least as a supplement, has anti-platelet effect undesirable for patients on blood thinners and similar medications. The review concludes that \"the synergistic effects of all tomato constituents are likely to outweigh the benefits of tomato's individual constituents, such as lycopene\".[113] Studies in 2014 and 2015 did not find conclusive evidence to indicate that the lycopene in tomatoes or in supplements affects the onset of cardiovascular diseases or cancer.[114][115] In the United States, supposed health benefits of consuming tomatoes, tomato products or lycopene to affect cancer cannot be mentioned on packaged food products without a qualified health claim statement.[116] In a scientific review of potential claims for lycopene favorably affecting DNA, skin exposed to ultraviolet radiation, heart function and vision, the European Food Safety Authority concluded in 2011 that the evidence for lycopene having any of these effects was inconclusive.[117] The potato tuber moth (Phthorimaea operculella) is an oligophagous insect that prefers to feed on plants of the family Solanaceae such as tomato plants. Female P. operculella use the leaves to lay their eggs and the hatched larvae will eat away at the mesophyll of the leaf.[118] Tomato forms a mutually beneficial symbiosis with arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi such as Rhizophagus irregularis. Scientists use tomato as a model species for investigating this symbiosis.[119] The town of Bu\u00f1ol, Spain, annually celebrates La Tomatina, a festival centered on an enormous tomato fight. On 30 August 2007, 40,000 Spaniards gathered to throw 115,000\u00a0kg (254,000\u00a0lb) of tomatoes at each other in the festival.[120] Several US states have adopted the tomato as a state fruit or vegetable (see above). Tomatoes have been designated the state vegetable of New Jersey. Arkansas took both sides by declaring the South Arkansas Vine Ripe Pink Tomato both the state fruit and the state vegetable in the same law, citing both its culinary and botanical classifications. In 2009, the state of Ohio passed a law making the tomato the state's official fruit. Tomato juice has been the official beverage of Ohio since 1965. Alexander W. Livingston, of Reynoldsburg, Ohio, played a large part in popularizing the tomato in the late 19th century; his efforts are commemorated in Reynoldsburg with an annual Tomato Festival. Flavr Savr was the first commercially grown genetically engineered food licensed for human consumption.[121] Tomatoes are a popular \"nonlethal\" throwing weapon in mass protests, and there was a common tradition of throwing rotten tomatoes at bad performers on a stage during the 19th century; today this is usually referenced as a metaphor. Embracing it for this protest connotation, the Dutch Socialist party adopted the tomato as their logo. The US city of Reynoldsburg, Ohio calls itself \"The Birthplace of the Tomato\", claiming the first commercial variety of tomato was bred there in the 19th century.[28] \"Rotten Tomatoes\" is an American review-aggregation website for film and television. The name \"Rotten Tomatoes\" derives from the practice of audiences throwing rotten tomatoes when disapproving of a poor stage performance.", "Mango Chutney": " Green mango chutney,[1] also known as raw mango chutney,[2] is an Indian and Pakistan chutney prepared from unripe mangoes.[3] Ripe mangoes are sweet and are not used for chutneys as they are eaten raw. Green unripe mangoes are hard and sour, and they are cooked as chutneys. Mango chutneys are tangy in taste. The mangoes are peeled and sprinkled with salt and turmeric, then fried in oil along with spices. Water is added and heated until the mango becomes soft.[4] The main ingredients in green mango chutney are chopped raw mangoes and a mixture of cumin seeds, fennel seeds, nigella seeds, fenugreek seeds and mustard seeds. An Australian variation of the dish features raisins and apples.[5] This Indian cuisine\u2013related article is a stub. You can help Wikipedia by expanding it.

Hot", "Paratha": " Paratha (pronounced [p\u0259\u02c8\u027e\u0251\u02d0t\u02b0\u0251\u02d0], also parantha) is a flatbread native to the Indian subcontinent,[1] with earliest reference mentioned in early medieval Sanskrit, India;[1] prevalent throughout the modern-day nations of India, Pakistan, Nepal, Bangladesh, Maldives, Afghanistan, Myanmar,[2] Malaysia, Singapore, Thailand, Mauritius, Fiji, Guyana, Suriname, and Trinidad and Tobago where wheat is the traditional staple. It is one of the most popular flatbreads in the Indian subcontinent and the Middle East.[3][4] Paratha is an amalgamation of the words parat and atta, which literally means layers of cooked dough.[5] Alternative spellings and names include parantha, parauntha, prontha, parontay, paronthi (Punjabi), porota (in Bengali), paratha (in Odia, Urdu, Hindi), palata (pronounced [p\u0259l\u00e0t\u00e0]; in Myanmar),[2] porotha (in Assamese), forota (in Sylheti), farata (in Mauritius and the Maldives), prata (in Southeast Asia), paratha, buss-up shut, oil roti (in the Anglophone Caribbean) and roti canai in Malaysia and Indonesia. The word paratha is derived from Sanskrit (S. \u092a\u0930, or \u092a\u0930\u093e+\u0938\u094d\u0925\u0903, or \u0938\u094d\u0925\u093f\u0924\u0903).[6] Recipes for various stuffed wheat puran polis (which Achaya (2003) describes as parathas) are mentioned in Manasollasa, a 12th-century Sanskrit encyclopedia compiled by Someshvara III, a Western Chalukya king, who ruled from present-day Karnataka, India.[7] References to paratha have also been mentioned by Nijjar (1968), in his book Panj\u0101b under the Sult\u0101ns, 1000\u20131526 AD when he writes that parathas were common with the nobility and aristocracy in the Punjab.[8] According to Banerji (2010), parathas are associated with  North Indian cooking. The method is to stuff parathas with a variety of stuffings. However, Banerji states, the Mughals were also fond of parathas which gave rise to the Dhakai paratha, multilayered and flaky, taking its name from Dhaka in Bangladesh.[9] O'Brien (2003) suggests that it is not correct to state that the paratha was popularised in Delhi after the 1947 partition of India, as the Punjabi item was prevalent in Delhi before then.[10] Parathas are one of the most popular unleavened flatbreads in the Indian subcontinent, made by baking or cooking whole-wheat (atta) dough on a tava, and finishing off with shallow-frying.[13] Plain parathas are thicker and more substantial than chapatis/rotis because they have been layered by coating with ghee or oil and folded repeatedly, much like the method used for puff pastry or a laminated dough technique, and as a result have a flaky consistency. Stuffed parathas may include a wide variety of ingredients and be made with a variety of preparation styles, traditionally depending on region of origin, and may not use folded dough techniques. To achieve the layered dough for plain parathas, a number of different traditional techniques exist.[13] These include covering the thinly rolled-out pastry with oil, folding back and forth like a paper fan and coiling the resulting strip into a round shape before rolling flat, baking on a tava and/or shallow frying. Another method is to cut a circle of dough from the center to its circumference along its radius, oiling the dough and starting at the cut edge rolling so as to form a cone which is then squashed into a disc shape and rolled out. The method of oiling and repeatedly folding the dough as in western puff pastry also exists, and this is combined with folding patterns that give traditional geometrical shapes to the finished parathas. Parathas can be round, heptagonal, square, or triangular.[citation needed] Common stuffed varieties include mashed spiced potatoes (aloo paratha), dal, cauliflower (gobi paratha), and minced lamb (keema paratha). Less common stuffing ingredients include mixed vegetables, green beans, carrots, other meats, leaf vegetables, radishes, and paneer. A Rajasthani mung bean paratha uses both the layering technique together with mung dal mixed into the dough. Some stuffed parathas are not layered, lacking in the flakiness of plain parathas, and instead resemble a filled pie squashed flat and shallow-fried, using two discs of dough sealed around the edges. Alternatively, they can be made by using a single disc of dough to encase a ball of filling and sealed with a series of pleats pinched into the dough around the top, they are then gently flattened with the palm against the working surface before being rolled into a circle.[citation needed] The paratha is an important part of a traditional breakfast from the Indian subcontinent. Traditionally, it is made using ghee but oil is also used. Some people may even bake it in the oven for health reasons. Usually, the paratha is eaten with dollops of white butter on top of it. Side dishes which go very well with paratha are curd, fried egg, omelette, mutton kheema (ground mutton cooked with vegetables and spices), nihari (a lamb dish), jeera aloo (potatoes lightly fried with cumin seeds), daal, and raita as part of a breakfast meal. It may be stuffed with potatoes, paneer, onions, qeema or chili peppers.", "Chicken Madras": " Madras curry or Madras sauce is a curry sauce.[1] Madras is brown in colour and is made with heavy use of chili powder. Raita is often used as an accompaniment to the dish. Madras curry is said to originate from the south of India, and gets its name from the city of Madras (now Chennai). There are many variations on Madras curry[2][3] and cooking in India is more a domestic practice than a cuisine governed by the conventions of chefs, restaurants, or texts. This curry can be vegetarian or made with meat. Availability of local or locally available ingredients is central to regional Indian foods. The result of the signatures of Madras curries can be achieved through different means; the result often being that of: red colour; roasted spices; the sour-sweet fruitiness of tamarind; a slight liquorice flavour of anise; ginger; a range of other spices (sweet and savoury and earthy) and the flavours of salt, sweet and sour. The redness is achieved with chilli or a mixture of chilli and paprika, and the orange of turmeric. Additional sourness may be had from lemon, lime or vinegar. The spices are complementary to the savoury flavours, which may include garlic and possibly onion or asafoetida. Garam masala, coriander, and black peppercorns may also be part of the spice mixture. Common ingredients may also include fresh curry leaves, and the final addition of fresh coriander. The variations include the roasting of many of the spices including dried chillis, coriander seed, aniseed, cumin and cinnamon. This can be done in an oven for 10 minutes at 180\u00a0\u00b0C, or in a frying pan with no oil at low heat. A basic spice mix for Madras curry can be made when these dried roasted ingredients are ground in a mortar and pestle or coffee grinder and mixed with turmeric and stored in readiness for use. Variations are also related to means of storage. The primary spice ingredients can be stored as roasted dried ground powder, a paste of dried ingredients with vinegar, or an oil spice infusion. If meat is used it may be lamb, beef, or chicken. When made of lamb it is called Gosht (or Ghoust) Madras. Common accompaniments to Madras curry include raita and fresh coriander. The food of southern India is more likely to have rice as the main carbohydrate than any breads e.g. naan. Individual households will express their own traditions. Other common variations will include brown mustard seeds which are fried till they pop, black peppercorns (a local tropical product) and vinegar as the acidulant instead of, or with, the acid fruits. The dried roasted spices may be cooked in ghee or vegetable oil and then other major fresh ingredients such as garlic and ginger are added with the vegetables and/or meat. The sweet and sour ingredients such as tamarind and lemon juice/vinegar is added later. Finally the fresh coriander is added immediately prior to serving. Other variations may include the use of cloves, bay leaves, fenugreek and allspice.

It is also a chicken dish served in Punjabi cuisine. The Kashmiri version of the dish, however, is grilled over red-hot coals, and does not always contain boneless pieces. The pieces are brushed with ghee (clarified butter) at intervals to increase its flavour, while being continuously fanned. It is typically eaten with green coriander and tamarind chutney served with onion rings and lemon, or used in preparing an authentic chicken tikka masala.[3] A chicken tikka sizzler is a dish where chicken tikka is served on a heated plate with onions.

Rose water-flavored and banana-flavored firnee are the two popular varieties. Afghan firnee is also traditionally prepared for special events and festivities such as weddings and Eid.[3]", "Panch Phoron": "Panch phoron, panch phodan or pancha phutana is a whole spice blend, originating from the eastern part of the Indian subcontinent and used in the cuisines of Eastern India and Northeastern India, especially in the cuisines of Bhojpur,[2] Mithila, Odisha, Assam, Bengal and Nepal. The name literally means \"five spices\". All of the spices in panch phoron are seeds. Typically, panch phoron consists of cumin seed (jeera), nigella seed (kalonji), fenugreek seed (methi), wild celery seed (radhuni or joni in Assamese) and fennel seed (sauf) in equal parts.[3] Some cooks prefer to use a smaller proportion of fenugreek seeds, because of their mildly bitter taste.[4]", "Saheena": "Saheena (also spelled sahina or sahiena) are a street-food and snack of Indian origin in Trinidadian cuisine. The dish traces back to indentured labourers from India. After the end of slavery in Trinidad in 1840, the plantations (that dominated Trinidad's economy at that time) needed a cheap substitute for the slaves' labour power. It was found in contract workers from British India. From 1840 on workers were recruited in large numbers who had to commit themselves for five years minimum and were promised five acres of land as a reward. Until World War I 145.000 mainly East Indian workers migrated to Trinidad, adopting their recipes to the supply of ingredients found in their new home.[1] According to the Dictionary of the English/Creole of Trinidad & Tobago the term saheena derives from the Bihari family of languages and means delicious or savoury.[2] The term saheena is a collective noun and is used in singular and plural form. Saheena are an ordinary dish and are being prepared at home as well as bought from takeaway stores and stalls. They are also served as a side dish at festive occasions such as Divali or Eid.[3] Mobile breakfast stalls that sell doubles, the most popular breakfast in Trinidad, often also sell saheena.[4] While many dishes of the Indo-Trinidadian cuisine are popular on other Caribbean islands Saheena remain a dish prevalent in Trinidad only.[5] Two common preparation methods for saheena exist: A more complex one (roll up) and a simple one (cut up). Both are based on the same ingredients, but since the share of the main ingredient and the preparation method differ, the preparation methods differ significantly in taste and texture. For both variants a creamy dough is prepared from grounded chickpeas or chickpea flour, flour, garlic, onions, spices and water. The most common spice for the dough is turmeric, with cumin and black pepper also being used frequently. To round out the taste, green seasoning, a popular herb mixture based on culantro, can be added. For the more complex preparation method (roll up) dasheen leaves and dough are layered by spreading dough onto the upper side of the current leaf. The stacked leaves are rolled up like roulades, fixated, and then either steamed[6] or cooked in a waterproof bag.[3] The rolls are then cut into slices, which are turned in spiced flour and dough and finally baked through. The dough for frying needs to be more chewy than the dough mixed with the leaves.[7] The roll-up method is mostly used for formal celebrations outdoors. For the easier preparation method (cut up) dasheen leaves are cut into small pieces, mixed with dough, formed into palm-sized cakelets and fried in oil or fat.[8] The cut-up methos is the one that's mainly found at food stalls.[5] An even more simple preparation method for cut-up saheena is preparing a mixture of minced dasheen leaves, water and industrial pholourie dough and frying it in portions.[6] Saheena are served with kuchela, a chutney or other condiments. Chutneys are omnipresent in Trinidadian cuisine; the predominant flavours are mango and tamarind. In addition to condiments, chili sauces are used on saheena. A common eating method for cut-up saheena is to cut it up and coat the insides with condiments. In Trinidad, dasheen leaves are available at markets rather than in supermarkets, so they're less readily available due to limited opening times. If unavailable, it is often exchanged for spinach which tastes similar,[6] or for collard.[4] When touched, dasheen leaves cause an itching of the hands. To prevent this, hands are slathered with a little bit of lime juice,[7] or the leaves are washed with a bit of lime juice. Leftovers of the dish can be used in a dish called \"saheena talkari\". Slices of roll-up saheena are cooked in a curry sauce and served with the sauce.[5] hot", "Tandoori Masala": " Tandoori masala or tandoori sauce is a mixture of spices specifically for use with a tandoor, or clay oven, in traditional cooking in the Indian subcontinent. The specific spices vary somewhat from one region to another but typically include: garam masala, garlic, ginger, onion, cayenne pepper, and sometimes other spices and additives. The spices are often ground together with a pestle and mortar. Kundan Lal Gujral revolutionized tandoori cooking, and the creation of the tandoori masala spice blend is attributed to him. Like many spices, there is also the influence of a colonial legacy present within the rise of tandoori masala as Kundan Lal was a Hindu Punjabi living in West Punjab, before the Partition of India, who ended up moving to Delhi, India in a time where communal violence rose after the Partition of India in 1947. While working in a restaurant in Peshawar in the 1920s, Kundan Lal experimented with the tandoor that was traditionally used for baking naan. In a stroke of genius, he was the first to cook chicken in the tandoor, and the spice blend he made and used for cooking the chicken in this manner became known as tandoori masala. In Delhi, Kundan Lal opened a restaurant called Moti Mahal, which is where dishes he created using tandoori masala reached national fame with politicians such as Jawaharlal Nehru favoring the taste and global fame as the restaurant became a global chain. Indian restaurants around the world pay homage to tandoori masala in their menus as tandoori chicken and butter chicken are highly popular staple features. [1] Tandoori masala is used extensively with dishes such as tandoori chicken. In this dish, the chicken is covered with a mixture of plain yogurt and tandoori masala. The chicken is then roasted in the tandoor on high heat; when prepared in this fashion the chicken has a pink-colored exterior and a savory flavor. Other chicken dishes, in addition to tandoori chicken, use this masala, such as tikka or butter chicken, most of them Punjabi dishes. Meat other than chicken can be used, as can paneer (paneer tikka). If freshly prepared, the masala can be stored in airtight jars for up to two months. The spice blend is also readily available at larger supermarkets and specialty Asian stores, with varying tastes depending on the brand.  This Indian cuisine\u2013related article is a stub.

Its name comes from the Persian and Urdu word (barf) for snow. Barfi is consumed throughout India and Pakistan and is especially popular in North India. It is often served at celebrations and religious festivals such as Diwali and Holi.[1][2][3] Barfi originated in Persia and was introduced to India by the Mughal Empire in the 16th century.[2][4] Through indentured workers it was brought to Trinidad in the mid-19th century and became popular there.[5] To prepare barfi, khoa (condensed milk) and granulated sugar are mixed and cooked together. When the mixture thickens to a fudge-like consistency, it is spread onto a greased plate. After cooling, it is cut into squares, diamonds, or circles. It can also be formed into balls, layered, or rolled into multicolored slices. When served at special occasions, it is often decorated with vark (edible silver foil). It can also be decorated with coconut, ground nuts, or powdered milk.[1][2][3] Fruit, nuts, legumes, spices, and other flavorings may be added to the khoa-sugar mixture and yield different varieties of barfi.  Commonly added fruits include guava and melon seeds. Typical nuts added include almonds,  cashews, coconut, and pistachios. Mung beans are sometimes added and yield moong dal barfi. Common flavorings and spices include cardamom, kewra (fragrant screwpine), orange, mango, saffron, rosewater, and vanilla. Food colorings may also be added.[1][2][3]", "Atlantic Salmon ": " The Atlantic salmon (Salmo salar) is a species of ray-finned fish in the family Salmonidae. It is the third largest of the Salmonidae, behind Siberian taimen and Pacific Chinook salmon, growing up to a meter in length. Atlantic salmon are found in the northern Atlantic Ocean and in rivers that flow into it. Most populations are anadromous, hatching in streams and rivers but moving out to sea as they grow where they mature, after which the adults seasonally move upstream again to spawn.[2] When the mature fish re-enter rivers to spawn, they change in colour and appearance. Some populations of this fish only migrate to large lakes, and are \"landlocked\", spending their entire lives in freshwater. Such populations are found throughout the range of the species. Unlike Pacific species of salmon, S. salar is iteroparous, which means it can survive spawning and return to sea to repeat the process again in another year with 5-10% returning to the sea to spawn again. Such individuals can grow to extremely large sizes, although they are rare. The different life stages of the fish are known by many different names in English: alevin, fry, parr and smolt. Atlantic salmon is considered a very healthy food and one of the fish with a more refined taste in many cultures. As such it features in numerous popular traditional cuisines and can fetch a higher price than some other fish. It has thus long been the target of recreational and commercial fishing, and this, as well as habitat destruction, has impacted the population in some areas. As a result, the species is the subject of conservation efforts in several countries, which appear to have been somewhat successful since the 2000s. Techniques to farm this species using aquacultural methods have also been developed, and at present it is farmed in great numbers in many places around the world.[where?] Although this is now a viable alternative to wild-caught fish, farming methods have attracted criticism from environmentalists.[3] The Atlantic salmon was given its scientific binomial name by Swedish zoologist and taxonomist Carl Linnaeus in 1758. The name, Salmo salar, derives from the Latin salmo, meaning salmon, and salar, meaning leaper, according to M. Barton,[4] but more likely meaning \"resident of salt water\" [citation needed].  Lewis and Short's Latin Dictionary (Clarendon Press, Oxford, 1879) translates salar as a kind of trout from its use in the Idylls of the poet Ausonius (4th century CE). Later, the differently coloured smolts were found to be the same species.[citation needed] Other names used for the Atlantic salmon are: bay salmon, black salmon, caplin-scull salmon, fiddler, sebago salmon, silver salmon, outside salmon and winnish. At different points in their maturation and life cycle, they are known as parr, smolt, grilse, grilt, kelt, slink, and spring salmon. Atlantic salmon that do not journey to sea are known as landlocked salmon (or ouananiche\u00a0[fr] in North America).[5][citation needed] Atlantic salmon are the largest species in their genus, Salmo. After two years at sea, the fish average 71 to 76\u00a0cm (28 to 30\u00a0in) in length and 3.6 to 5.4\u00a0kg (7.9 to 11.9\u00a0lb) in weight.[6] But specimens that spend four or more winters feeding at sea can be much larger. An Atlantic salmon netted in 1960 in Scotland, in the estuary of the river Hope, weighed 49.44\u00a0kg (109.0\u00a0lb), the heaviest recorded in all available literature. Another netted in 1925 in Norway measured 160.65\u00a0cm (63.25\u00a0in) in length, the longest Atlantic salmon on record.[7] The colouration of young Atlantic salmon does not resemble the adult stage. While they live in fresh water, they have blue and red spots. At maturity, they take on a silver-blue sheen. The easiest way of identifying them as an adult is by the black spots predominantly above the lateral line, though the caudal fin is usually unspotted. When they reproduce, males take on a slight green or red colouration. The salmon has a fusiform body, and well-developed teeth. All fins, except the adipose fin, are bordered with black.[citation needed] The natural breeding grounds of Atlantic salmon are rivers in Europe and the northeastern coast of North America. In Europe, Atlantic salmon are still found as far south as Spain, and as far north as Russia.[citation needed] Because of sport-fishing, some of the species' southern populations in northern Spain are growing smaller.[9] The species distribution is easily influenced by changes in freshwater habitat and climate. Atlantic salmon are a cold-water fish species and are particularly sensitive to changes in water temperature.[citation needed] The Housatonic River, and its Naugatuck River tributary, hosted the southernmost Atlantic salmon spawning runs in the United States.[10][11] However, there is a 1609 account by Henry Hudson that Atlantic salmon once ran up the Hudson River.[12] In addition, fish scale evidence dating to 10,000 years BP places Atlantic salmon in a coastal New Jersey pond.[13] Two publications from 1988 and 1996 questioned the notion that Atlantic salmon were prehistorically plentiful in New England, when the climate was warmer as it is now. This argument was primarily based on a paucity of bone data in archaeological sites relative to other fish species, and the assertion that historical claims of abundance may have been exaggerated.[14][15] This argument was later challenged in another paper which claimed that lack of archaeological bone fragments could be explained by salmon bones being rare at sites that still have large salmon runs and that salmonid bones in general are poorly recovered relative to other fish species.[16][17] Atlantic salmon populations were significantly reduced in the United States following European settlement. The fur trade, timber harvesting, dams and mills and agriculture degraded freshwater habitats and lowered the carrying capacity of most North American streams. Beaver populations were trapped to near-extinction by 1800, and log drives and clear-cutting further exacerbated stream erosion and habitat loss. As timber and fur gave way to agriculture, freshwater Atlantic salmon habitat was further compromised. According to historian D.W. Dunfield (1985) \"over half of the historical Atlantic salmon runs had been lost in North America by 1850\". As early as 1798, a bill for the preservation of Atlantic Salmon was introduced in Canadian Parliament, to protect populations in Lake Ontario.[18] In the Gulf Region of Nova Scotia it was reported that 31 of the 33 Atlantic salmon streams were blocked off by lumber dams, leading to the extirpation of early-run fish in many watersheds. The inshore Atlantic salmon fishery became a major export of the New World, with major fishing operations establishing along the shores of major river systems. The southernmost populations were the first to disappear.[citation needed] Young salmon spend one to four years in their natal river. When they are large enough (c. 15 centimetres (5.9\u00a0in)), they smoltify, changing camouflage from stream-adapted with large, gray spots to sea-adapted with shiny sides. They also undergo some endocrinological changes to adapt to osmotic differences between fresh water and seawater habitat. When smoltification is complete, the parr (young fish) now begin to swim with the current instead of against it. With this behavioral change, the fish are now referred to as smolt. When the smolt reach the sea, they follow sea surface currents and feed on plankton or fry from other fish species such as herring. During their time at sea, they can sense the change in the Earth magnetic field through iron in their lateral line.[citation needed] When they have had a year of good growth, they will move to the sea surface currents that transport them back to their natal river. It is a major misconception that salmon swim thousands of kilometres at sea; instead they surf through sea surface currents.[citation needed] It is possible they find their natal river by smell, although this is not confirmed;[19] only 5% of Atlantic salmon go up the wrong river.[citation needed] The range of an individual Atlantic salmon can thus be the river where they are born and the sea surface currents that are connected to that river in a circular path.[citation needed] Wild salmon continued to disappear from many rivers during the twentieth century due to overfishing and habitat change.[19] Young salmon begin a feeding response within a few days. After the yolk sac is absorbed by the body, they begin to hunt. Juveniles start with tiny invertebrates, but as they mature, they may occasionally eat small fish. During this time, they hunt both in the substrate and in the current. Some have been known to eat salmon eggs. Plankton such as euphausiids are important food for pre-grilse but amphipods and decapods are also consumed.[20] The most commonly eaten foods include caddisflies, blackflies, mayflies, stoneflies,[19] and chironomids, as well as terrestrial insects.[20] As adults, the salmon prefer capelin as their meal of choice. Capelin are elongated silvery fish that grow up to 20\u201325 centimetres (8\u201310\u00a0in) long.[21] Other fish consumed include herring, alewives, smelts, scomberids, sand lance, and small cod.[20] Fry and parr have been said[by whom?] to be territorial, but evidence[example  needed] showing them to guard territories is inconclusive. While they may occasionally[when?] be aggressive towards each other, the social hierarchy is still unclear. Many[quantify] have been found[by whom?] to school, especially when leaving the estuary. Adult Atlantic salmon are considered[by whom?] much more aggressive than other salmon, and are more likely to attack other fish than others.[19] Most Atlantic salmon follow an anadromous migration pattern,[2] in that they undergo their greatest feeding and growth in saltwater; however, adults return to spawn in native freshwater streams where the eggs hatch and juveniles grow through several distinct stages.[citation needed] Atlantic salmon do not require saltwater. Numerous examples of fully freshwater (i.e., \"landlocked\") populations of the species exist throughout the Northern Hemisphere,[2] including a now extinct population in Lake Ontario, which has been shown in recent studies to have spent its entire life cycle in the watershed of the lake.[22] In North America, the landlocked strains are frequently known as ouananiche.[citation needed] The freshwater phases of Atlantic salmon vary between two and eight years, according to river location.[23] While the young in southern rivers, such as those to the English Channel, are only one year old when they leave, those further north, such as in Scottish rivers, can be over four years old, and in Ungava Bay, northern Quebec, smolts as old as eight years have been encountered.[23] The first phase is the alevin stage, when the fish stay in the breeding ground and use the remaining nutrients in their yolk sacs. During this developmental stage, their young gills develop and they become active hunters. Next is the fry stage, where the fish grow and subsequently leave the breeding ground in search of food. During this time, they move to areas with higher prey concentration. The final freshwater stage is when they develop into parr, in which they prepare for the trek to the Atlantic Ocean.[citation needed] During these times, the Atlantic salmon are very susceptible to predation. Nearly 40% are eaten by trout alone. Other predators include other fish and birds.[citation needed] Egg and juvenile survival is dependent on habitat quality as Atlantic salmon are sensitive to ecological change.[citation needed] When parr develop into smolt, they begin the trip to the ocean, which predominantly happens between March and June. Migration allows acclimation to the changing salinity. Once ready, young smolt leave, preferring an ebb tide.[citation needed] Having left their natal streams, they experience a period of rapid growth during the one to four years they live in the ocean. Typically, Atlantic salmon migrate from their home streams to an area on the continental plate off West Greenland. During this time, they face predation from humans, seals, Greenland sharks, skate, cod, and halibut. Some dolphins have been noticed playing with dead salmon, but it is still unclear whether they consume them.[citation needed] Once large enough, Atlantic salmon change into the grilse phase, when they become ready to return to the same freshwater tributary they departed from as smolts. After returning to their natal streams, the salmon will cease eating altogether prior to spawning. Although largely unknown, odor \u2013 the exact chemical signature of that stream \u2013 may play an important role in how salmon return to the area where they hatched. Once heavier than about 250\u00a0g, the fish no longer become prey for birds and many fish, although seals do prey upon them. Grey and common seals commonly eat Atlantic salmon. Survivability to this stage has been estimated at between 14 and 53%.[19] Atlantic salmon breed in the rivers of Western Europe from northern Portugal north to Norway, Iceland, and Greenland, and the east coast of North America from Connecticut in the United States north to northern Labrador and Arctic Canada.[citation needed] The species constructs a nest or \"redd\" in the gravel bed of a stream. The female creates a powerful downdraught of water with her tail near the gravel to excavate a depression. After she and a male fish have eggs and milt (sperm), respectively, upstream of the depression, the female again uses her tail, this time to shift gravel to cover the eggs and milt which have lodged in the depression.[citation needed] Unlike the various Pacific salmon species which die after spawning (semelparous), the Atlantic salmon is iteroparous, which means the fish may recondition themselves and return to the sea to repeat the migration and spawning pattern several times, although most spawn only once or twice.[2][24] Migration and spawning exact an enormous physiological toll on individuals, such that repeat spawners are the exception rather than the norm.[24] Atlantic salmon show high diversity in age of maturity and may mature as parr, one- to five-sea-winter fish, and in rare instances, at older sea ages. This variety of ages can occur in the same population, constituting a 'bet hedging' strategy against variation in stream flows. So in a drought year, some fish of a given age will not return to spawn, allowing that generation other, wetter years in which to spawn.[23] When in shared breeding habitats, Atlantic salmon will hybridize with brown trout (Salmo trutta).[25][26][27] Hybrids between Atlantic salmon and brown trout were detected in two of four watersheds studied in northern Spain. The proportions of hybrids in samples of salmon ranged from 0 to 7-7% but these proportions were not significantly homogeneous among locations, resulting in a mean hybridization rate of 2-3%. This is the highest rate of natural hybridization so far reported and is significantly greater than rates observed elsewhere in Europe.[28] The decline in anadromous salmonid species over the last two to three centuries is correlated with the decline in the North American beaver and European beaver, although some fish and game departments[example  needed] continue to advocate removal of beaver dams as potential barriers to spawning runs. Migration of adult Atlantic salmon may be limited by beaver dams during periods of low stream flows, but the presence of juvenile salmon upstream of the dams suggests they are penetrated by parr.[29] Downstream migration of Atlantic salmon smolts was similarly unaffected by beaver dams, even in periods of low flows.[29] In a 2003 study, Atlantic salmon and sea-run brown trout spawning in the Numedalsl\u00e5gen River and 51 of its tributaries in southeastern Norway was unhindered by beavers.[30] In a restored, third-order stream in northern Nova Scotia, beaver dams generally posed no barrier to Atlantic salmon migration except in the smallest upstream reaches in years of low flow where pools were not deep enough to enable the fish to leap the dam or without a column of water over-topping the dam for the fish to swim up.[31] The importance of winter habitat to salmonids afforded by beaver ponds may be especially important in streams of northerly latitudes without deep pools where ice cover makes contact with the bottom of shallow streams.[29] In addition, the up to eight-year-long residence time of juveniles in freshwater may make beaver-created permanent summer pools a crucial success factor for Atlantic salmon populations. In fact, two-year-old Atlantic salmon parr in beaver ponds in eastern Canada showed faster summer growth in length and mass and were in better condition than parr upstream or downstream from the pond.[32] Atlantic salmon is a popular fish for human consumption[2] and is commonly sold fresh, canned, or frozen.[citation needed] Wood and stone weirs along streams and ponds were used for millennia to harvest salmon in the rivers of New England.[33] European fishermen gillnetted for Atlantic salmon in rivers using hand-made nets for many centuries[34] and gillnetting was also used in early colonial America.[35] In its natal streams, Atlantic salmon are considered prized recreational fish, pursued by fly anglers during its annual runs. At one time, the species supported an important commercial fishery, but having become endangered throughout its range globally, wild-caught Atlantic salmon are now virtually absent from the market.[36] Instead, nearly all are from aquaculture farms, predominantly in Norway, Chile, Canada, the UK, Ireland, Faroe Islands, Russia and Tasmania in Australia.[24] Adult male and female fish are anaesthetised; their eggs and sperm are \"stripped\" after the fish are cleaned and cloth dried. Sperm and eggs are mixed, washed, and placed into freshwater. Adults recover in flowing, clean, well-aerated water.[37] Some researchers have even studied cryopreservation of their eggs.[38] Fry are generally reared in large freshwater tanks for 12 to 20 months. Once the fish have reached the smolt phase, they are taken out to sea, where they are held for up to two years. During this time, the fish grow and mature in large cages off the coasts of Canada, the US, or parts of Europe.[24] There are many different commercially available cage designs built to operate in a wide variety of aquatic conditions. High-density polyethylene (HDPE) cages are widely used, with HDPE pipes forming a floating collar ring onto which the fish net pen is secured and suspended in the water below.[39] Advancements in cage technologies have allowed for reduction in fish escapes, improvement in growing conditions, and maximization of aquaculture production volume per unit area of growing space.[39] Farmed Atlantic salmon are known to occasionally escape from cages and enter the habitat of wild populations. Interbreeding between escaped farm fish and wild fish decreases genetic diversity and introduces \"the potential to genetically alter native populations, reduce local adaptation and negatively affect population viability and character\".[40] A study in 2000 demonstrated that the genes of farmed Atlantic salmon intrude wild populations mainly through wild males breeding with farmed females, though farmed specimens showed reduced capacity for breeding success overall compared to their wild counterparts.[41] Further study in 2018 discovered extensive cross-breeding of wild and farmed Atlantic salmon in the Northwest Atlantic, showing that 27.1% of fish in 17 out of 18 rivers examined are artificially stocked or hybrids. Farming of Atlantic salmon in open cages at sea has also been linked, at least in part, to a decline in wild stocks attributed to the passing of parasites from farmed to wild individuals.[42] On the west coast of the United States and Canada, aquaculturists are generally under scrutiny to ensure that non-native Atlantic salmon cannot escape from their open-net pens, however occasional incidents of escape have been documented.[43] During one incident in 2017, for example, up to 300,000 potentially invasive Atlantic salmon escaped a farm among the San Juan Islands in Puget Sound, Washington.[44] Washington went on in 2019 to implement a gradual phase out of salmon farming to be completed by 2025.[45] Despite being the source of considerable controversy,[46] the likelihood of escaped Atlantic salmon establishing an invasive presence in the Pacific Northwest is considered minimal, largely because a number of 20th century efforts aimed at deliberately introducing them to the region were ultimately unsuccessful.[47] From 1905 until 1935, for example, in excess of 8.6 million Atlantic salmon of various life stages (predominantly advanced fry) were intentionally introduced to more than 60 individual British Columbia lakes and streams. Historical records indicate, in a few instances, mature sea-run Atlantic salmon were captured in the Cowichan River; however, a self-sustaining population never materialized. Similarly unsuccessful results were realized after deliberate attempts at introduction by Washington as late as the 1980s.[48] Consequently, environmental assessments by the US National Marine Fisheries Service (NMFS), the Washington Department of Fish and Wildlife and the BC Environmental Assessment Office have concluded the potential risk of Atlantic salmon colonization in the Pacific Northwest is low.[49] A study of N\u00e6ve et al. (2022) estimated the impact of 50 years of genetic selection and tried to predict the impact it could have until 2050. In order to do this, a common garden experiment was used to model and simulate past and future effects for 11 generations of genetic selection of increased growth rate in Atlantic salmon. To model the contribution that breeding has made in the industry from generation 0 (harvested in 1975\u2013 1978) to generation 11 (harvested in 2017 \u2013 2019), and to simulate growth until 2050 (generation 24), the Norwegian salmon aquaculture production between 2016 and 2019 was used as a base case. The simulation of the expected growth until 2050 (generation 24) gave five different scenarios\u00a0: Historical (H1), Forecast 1 (F1), Forecast 2 (F2), Forecast 3 (F3) and Forecast 4 (F4). Changes in thermal growth coefficient (TGC) per generation were used in the model to simulate the differences in the five scenarios. The genetic data, H1, and the most conservative forecast scenario, F1, simulate what can be expected in 2050 if the trend from generation 0 through 11 is maintained. The following forecast scenarios assume a greater increase in genetic growth with a larger increase in the TGC in the generations to come. In the next two generations, more advanced selection methods such as marker assisted selection (from generation 10) and genomic selection (from generation 11) were implemented. This resulted in increased gain in selection for growth and simulated F2 and F3. The most progressive scenario, F4, aimed at exploring the effect in the industry when the full genetic potential is utilized. This assumes a further development of advanced techniques in the years to come.\nThe authors of the article found that the daily yield of the biomass increased with increasing generations in the historic and forecast scenarios. Further, the production time in seawater to reach the harvest weight of 5100 g is expected to be reduced by 53% in 2050. When production time can be reduced, this will also reduce e.g. time at risk of diseases. In the most progressive scenario, mortality in seawater was expected to be reduced by up to 50%. Further, the authors found that production per license can increase by up to 121%. Additionally, 77% of the new volume needed to achieve five million tonnes in 2050, may be provided by genomic selection. However, one should keep in mind that this article was published by the firm Aquagen, and can possibly be biased and too optimistic.[50] The IUCN rates this as a common species with a conservation status of \"least concern\", however it has been 25 years since the IUCN has released this status.[51][52] A more recent regional assessment revealed that the European population of this species is vulnerable, and this might be the same or a similar status globally. Location-specific assessments have shown population declines across parts of the Atlantic Salmon's natural range, with populations along the coast of Maine and the Inner Bay of Fundy now listed as \"endangered\" under the Endangered Species Act, and the Canadian Species at Risk Act, respectively.[53][51] Human activities have impacted salmon populations across parts of its range. The major threats are from overfishing and habitat change.[18] Salmon decline in Lake Ontario goes back to the 18th\u201319th centuries, due to logging and soil erosion, as well as dam and mill construction. By 1896, the species was declared extirpated from the lake.[22][54] In the 1950s, salmon from rivers in the United States and Canada, as well as from Europe, were discovered to gather in the sea around Greenland and the Faroe Islands. A commercial fishing industry was established, taking salmon using drift nets. After an initial series of record annual catches, the numbers crashed; between 1979 and 1990, catches fell from four million to 700,000.[55] Beginning around 1990, the rates of Atlantic salmon mortality at sea more than doubled in the western Atlantic. Rivers of the coast of Maine, southern New Brunswick and much of mainland Nova Scotia saw runs drop precipitously, and even disappear. An international effort to study the increased mortality rate was organized by the North Atlantic Salmon Conservation Organization.[5] In 2000 the numbers of Atlantic salmon dropped to very low levels in Newfoundland, Canada.[56] In 2007 at least one sport fishing organization from Iceland and Scandinavia blamed less fish caught by recreational anglers on overfishing at sea, and thus created the North Atlantic Salmon Fund to buy commercial quotas in the Atlantic from commercial fishermen in an effort to preserve wild Salmo salar stocks.[55] Possibly because of improvements in ocean feeding grounds, returns in 2008 were very positive. On the Penobscot River in Maine, returns were about 940 in 2007, and by mid-July 2008, the return was 1,938. Similar stories were reported in rivers from Newfoundland to Quebec. In 2011, more than 3,100 salmon returned to the Penobscot, the most since 1986, and nearly 200 ascended the Narraguagus River, up from the low two digits just a decade before.[5][57] Recreational fishing of stocked, landlocked Atlantic salmon is now authorized in much of the US and Canada where it occurs in large numbers, but this is subject to regulations in many states or provinces which are designed to maintain the continuity of the species. Strict catch limits, catch and release practices and forced fly fishing are examples of those regulations.[58][59] However, catch and release angling can be an additional stressor on Atlantic salmon populations, especially when its impacts are combined with the existing pressures of climate change, overfishing, and predation.[60][58] Around the North Atlantic, efforts to restore salmon to their native habitats are underway, with slow progress. Habitat restoration and protection are key to this process, but issues of excessive harvest and competition with farmed and escaped salmon are also primary considerations. In the Great Lakes, Atlantic salmon have been reintroduced, but the percentage of salmon reproducing naturally is very low. Most areas are re-stocked annually.[18] Since the extirpation of Atlantic salmon from Lake Ontario in the late 19th century, the state of New York has stocked its adjoining rivers and tributaries, and in many cases does not allow active fishing.[2][61][18] The province of Ontario started the Atlantic Salmon Restoration Program[62] in 2006, which is one of the largest freshwater conservation programs in North America. It has since stocked Lake Ontario and surrounding tributaries with upwards of 6,000,000 young Atlantic salmon, with efforts growing each year.[63] In New England, many efforts are underway to restore salmon to the region by knocking down obsolete dams and updating others with fish ladders and other techniques that have proven effective in the West with Pacific salmon. There is some success thus far, with populations growing in the Penobscot and Connecticut Rivers. Lake Champlain now has Atlantic salmon. The Atlantic Salmon Federation is involved in restoration efforts along the eastern United States and Canada, where their projects are focused on removing barriers to fish passage and eradicating invasive species.[64] Recent documented successes in the reintroduction of Atlantic salmon include the following: The North Atlantic Salmon Conservation Organization is an international council made up of Canada, the European Union, Iceland, Norway, the Russian Federation, and the United States, with its headquarters in Edinburgh. It was established in 1983 to help protect Atlantic salmon stocks, through the cooperation between nations. They work to restore habitat and promote conservation of the salmon.[68] In December 2021, NASCO published an updated interactive map of their Rivers Database, showing the stock status of wild Atlantic salmon populations across the species range. Edward I instituted a penalty for collecting salmon during certain times of the year. His son Edward II continued, regulating the construction of weirs. Enforcement was overseen by those appointed by the justices of the peace. Because of confusing laws and the appointed conservators having little power, most laws were barely enforced.[citation needed] Based on this, a royal commission was appointed in 1860 to thoroughly investigate the Atlantic salmon and the laws governing the species, resulting in the 1861 Salmon Fisheries Act. The act placed enforcement of the laws under the Home Office's control, but it was later transferred to the Board of Trade, and then later to the Board of Agriculture and Fisheries. Another act passed in 1865 imposed charges to fish and catch limits. It also caused the formation of local boards having jurisdiction over a certain river. The next significant act, passed in 1907, allowed the board to charge 'duties' to catch other freshwater fish, including trout.[citation needed] Despite legislation, board effects decreased until, in 1948, the River Boards Act gave authority of all freshwater fish and the prevention of pollution to one board per river. In total, it created 32 boards. In 1974, the 32 boards, which by then were integrated into regional river authorities, were reduced to 10 regional water authorities (RWAs). Although only the Northumbrian Water Authority, Welsh National Water Development Authority, Northwest Water Authority and Southwest Water Authority  had significant salmon populations, all ten also regulated and conserved  trout and freshwater eel fisheries The Salmon and Freshwater Fisheries Act was passed in 1975. Among other things, it regulated fishing licences, seasons, and size limits, and banned obstructing the salmon's migratory paths.[19] Salmon was greatly valued in medieval Scotland, and various fishing methods, including the use of weirs, cruives, and nets, were used to catch the fish. Fishing for salmon was heavily regulated in order to conserve the resource.[69] In 1318, King Robert I enacted legislation setting a minimum size for cruives, \"so that no fry of fish are impeded from ascending and descending...\" Laws on catching fish upon royal lands were frequently updated, demonstrating their importance.[69] Because the fish were held in such high regard, poachers were severely punished; a person twice convicted of poaching salmon on a royal estate could be sentenced to death.[70] The export of salmon was economically important in Aberdeen; beginning in the 15th century, the fish could be preserved through salting and barreling, allowing them to be exported abroad, including as far away as the Baltic. The volume of the early Scottish salmon trade is impossible to determine, since surviving custom records date only from the 1420 onward, and since Aberdeen burgesses enjoyed an exemption on salmon customs until the 1530s.[71] During the 15th century, many laws were passed; many regulated fishing times, and worked to ensure smolts could safely pass downstream. James III even closed a meal mill because of its history of killing fish attracted to the wheel.[citation needed] More recent legislation has established commissioners who manage districts. Furthermore, the Salmon and Freshwater Fisheries Act in 1951 required the Secretary of State be given data about the catches of salmon and trout to help establish catch limits.[19][37] Commercial and recreational fishing of wild, anadromous Atlantic salmon is prohibited in the United States.[6] Several populations of Atlantic salmon are in serious decline, and are listed as endangered under the Endangered Species Act (ESA). Currently, runs of 11 rivers in Maine are on the list \u2013 Kennebec, Androscoggin, Penobscot, Sheepscot, Ducktrap, Cove Brook, Pleasant, Narraguagus, Machias, East Machias and Dennys. The Penobscot River is the \"anchor river\" for Atlantic salmon populations in the US. Returning fish in 2008 were around 2,000, more than double the 2007 return of 940.[citation needed] Section 9 of the ESA makes it illegal to take an endangered species of fish or wildlife. The definition of \"take\" is to \"harass, harm, pursue, hunt, shoot, wound, kill, trap, capture, or collect, or to attempt to engage in any such conduct\".[72] The federal government has prime responsibility for protecting the Atlantic salmon, but over the last generation, effort has continued to shift management as much as possible to provincial authorities through memoranda of understanding, for example. A new Atlantic salmon policy is in the works, and in the past three years,[when?] the government has attempted to pass a new version of the century-old Fisheries Act through Parliament.[citation needed] Federal legislation regarding at-risk populations is weak.[citation needed] Inner Bay of Fundy Atlantic salmon runs were declared endangered in 2000. A recovery and action plan is in place.[73] Nongovernmental organizations, such as the Atlantic Salmon Federation,[74] constantly demand for improvements in management, and for initiatives to be considered. For example, the ASF and the Nova Scotia Salmon Association desire the use of technology for mitigation of acid rain-affected rivers such as used in Norway is in 54 Nova Scotia rivers and managed to raise the funds to get a project in place in one river.[citation needed] In Quebec, the daily catch limit for Atlantic salmon is dependent on the individual river. Some rivers are strictly catch and release with a limit of 3 released fish. Each catch must be declared. Some rivers allow you to keep between 1 or 2 grilse (30\u00a0cm to 63\u00a0cm), while some of the more prolific rivers (mainly on the north coast) will allow you to keep 1 salmon over 63\u00a0cm. The annual catch limit is 4 Atlantic salmon of small size and only 1 of those may be bigger than 63\u00a0cm.[citation needed] In Lake Ontario, the historic populations of Atlantic salmon became extinct, and cross-national efforts have been under way to reintroduce the species, with some areas already having restocked naturally reproducing populations.[75][76]", "Bhendi": " Okra (US: /\u02c8o\u028akr\u0259/, UK: /\u02c8\u0252kr\u0259/), Abelmoschus esculentus, known in some English-speaking countries as lady's fingers,[2][3] is a flowering plant in the mallow family native to East Africa.[4] It has edible green seed pods. Cultivated in tropical, subtropical, and warm temperate regions around the world, okra is used in the cuisines of many countries.[5] Abelmoschus is Neo-Latin from Arabic: \u0623\u064e\u0628\u064f\u0648 \u0627\u0644\u0645\u0650\u0633\u0652\u0643, romanized:\u00a0\u02beab\u016b l-misk, lit.\u2009'father of musk',[6] while esculentus is Latin for being fit for human consumption.[7] The first use of the word okra (alternatively; okro or ochro) appeared in 1679 in the Colony of Virginia, deriving from Igbo: \u1ecd\u0301kw\u1ee5\u0300r\u1ee5\u0300.[8] The word gumbo was first used in American English around 1805, derived from Louisiana Creole,[9] but originates from either Umbundu: ochingg\u00f5mbo[10] or Kimbundu: kingombo.[11] Even though the word gumbo often refers to the dish gumbo in most of the United States, many places in the Deep South may have used it to refer to the pods and plant as well as many other variants of the word found across the African diaspora in the Americas.[12] Okra is an allopolyploid of uncertain parentage. However, proposed parents include Abelmoschus ficulneus, A.\u00a0tuberculatus and a reported \"diploid\" form of okra.[13] Truly wild (as opposed to naturalised) populations are not known with certainty, and the West African variety has been described as a cultigen.[14] Okra originated in East Africa in Ethiopia, Eritrea, and eastern Sudan.[4][15] Okra was introduced to Europe by the Umayyad conquest of Hispania. One of the earliest accounts is by Abu al-Abbas al-Nabati, who visited Ayyubid Egypt in 1216 and described the plant under cultivation by the locals who ate the tender, young pods with meal.[16] From Arabia, the plant spread around the shores of the Mediterranean Sea and eastward.[17] The plant was introduced to the Americas by ships plying the Atlantic slave trade[18] by 1658, when its presence was recorded in Brazil. It was further documented in Suriname in 1686. Okra may have been introduced to southeastern North America from Africa in the early 18th century. By 1748, it was being grown as far north as Philadelphia.[19] Thomas Jefferson noted it was well established in Virginia by 1781. It was commonplace throughout the Southern United States by 1800, and the first mention of different cultivars was in 1806.[4] The species is a perennial, often cultivated as an annual in temperate climates, often growing to around 2 metres (6\u00a0ft 7\u00a0in) tall. As a member of the Malvaceae, it is related to such species as cotton, cocoa, and hibiscus. The leaves are 10\u201320 centimetres (4\u20138\u00a0in) long and broad, palmately lobed with 5\u20137 lobes. The flowers are 4\u20138 centimetres (1+5\u20448\u20133+1\u20448\u00a0in) in diameter, with five white to yellow petals, often with a red or purple spot at the base of each petal. The pollens are spherical and approximately 188 microns in diameter. The fruit is a capsule up to 18 centimetres (7\u00a0in) long with pentagonal cross-section, containing numerous seeds. Abelmoschus esculentus is cultivated throughout the tropical and warm temperate regions of the world for its fibrous fruits or pods containing round, white seeds. It is among the most heat- and drought-tolerant vegetable species in the world and will tolerate soils with heavy clay and intermittent moisture, but frost can damage the pods. In cultivation, the seeds are soaked overnight prior to planting to a depth of 1\u20132 centimetres (3\u20448\u201313\u204416\u00a0in). It prefers a soil temperature of at least 20\u00a0\u00b0C (68\u00a0\u00b0F) for germination, which occurs between six days (soaked seeds) and three weeks. As a tropical plant, it also requires a lot of sunlight, and it should also be cultivated in soil that has a pH between 5.8 and 7, ideally on the acidic side.[20] Seedlings require ample water. The seed pods rapidly become fibrous and woody and, to be edible as a vegetable, must be harvested when immature, usually within a week after pollination.[21] The first harvest will typically be ready about 2 months after planting, and it will be approximately 2\u20133 inches (51\u201376\u00a0mm) long.[20] The most common disease afflicting the okra plant is verticillium wilt, often causing a yellowing and wilting of the leaves. Other diseases include powdery mildew in dry tropical regions, leaf spots, yellow mosaic and root-knot nematodes. Resistance to yellow mosaic virus in A. esculentus was transferred through a cross with Abelmoschus manihot and resulted in a new variety called Parbhani kranti.[22] In the United States much of the supply is grown in Florida, especially around Dade in southern Florida.[23][24] Okra is grown throughout the state to some degree, so okra is available ten months of the year.[23] Yields range from less than 18,000 pounds per acre (20,000\u00a0kg/ha) to over 30,000 pounds per acre (34,000\u00a0kg/ha).[23] Wholesale prices can go as high as $18/bushel which is $0.60 per pound ($1.3/kg).[23] The Regional IPM Centers provide integrated pest management plans for use in the state.[23] In 2021, world production of okra was 10.8 million tonnes, led by India with 60% of the total, with Nigeria and Mali as secondary producers. Raw okra contains 90% water, 2% protein, 7% carbohydrates and negligible fat. In a 100 gram reference amount, raw okra is a rich source (20% or more of the Daily Value, DV) of dietary fiber, vitamin C, and vitamin K, with moderate contents of thiamin, folate and magnesium (table). Okra is one of three thickeners that may be used in gumbo soup from Louisiana.[28] Fried okra is a dish from the Cuisine of the Southern United States. In Cuba and Puerto Rico, the vegetable is referred to as quimbomb\u00f3, and is used in dishes such as quimbomb\u00f3 guisado (stewed okra), a dish similar to gumbo.[29][30] It is also used in traditional dishes in the Dominican Republic, where it is called molondr\u00f3n.[31] In Brazil, it is an important component of several regional dishes, such as Caruru, made with shrimp, in the Northeastern region, and Frango com Quiabo (Chicken with Okra) and Carne Refogada com Quiabo (Stewed meat with Okra) in Minas Gerais. In South Asia, the pods are used in many spicy vegetable preparations as well as cooked with beef, mutton, lamb and chicken.[32][33]  The pods of the plant are mucilaginous, resulting in the characteristic \"goo\" or slime when the seed pods are cooked; the mucilage contains soluble fiber.[34] One possible way to de-slime okra is to cook it with an acidic food, such as tomatoes, to minimize the mucilage.[35] Pods are cooked, pickled, eaten raw, or included in salads. Okra may be used in developing countries to mitigate malnutrition and alleviate food insecurity.[34] Young okra leaves may be cooked similarly to the greens of beets or dandelions, or used in salads. Okra seeds may be roasted and ground to form a caffeine-free substitute for coffee.[4] When importation of coffee was disrupted by the American Civil War in 1861, the Austin State Gazette said, \"An acre of okra will produce seed enough to furnish a plantation with coffee in every way equal to that imported from Rio.\"[36] Greenish-yellow edible okra oil is pressed from okra seeds; it has a pleasant taste and odor, and is high in unsaturated fats such as oleic acid and linoleic acid.[37] The oil content of some varieties of the seed is about 40%. At 794 kilograms per hectare (708\u00a0lb/acre), the yield was exceeded only by that of sunflower oil in one trial.[38] Bast fibre from the stem of the plant has industrial uses such as the reinforcement of polymer composites.[39] The mucilage produced by the okra plant can be used for the removal of turbidity from wastewater by virtue of its flocculant properties.[40][41] Having composition similar to a thick polysaccharide film, okra mucilage is under development as a biodegradable food packaging, as of 2018.[42] A 2009 study found okra oil suitable for use as a biofuel.[43]", "Rajma": " R\u0101jm\u0101[2] [ra\u02d0d\u0292ma\u02d0] (Hindi: \u0930\u093e\u091c\u092e\u093e, Nepali: \u0930\u093e\u091c\u092e\u093e, Urdu: \u0631\u0627\u062c\u0645\u0627), also known as rajmah, r\u0101zm\u0101, or lal lobia, is a vegetarian dish, originating from the Indian subcontinent, consisting of red kidney beans in a thick gravy with many Indian whole spices, and is usually served with rice. It is a part of the regular diet in Northern India, Nepal and Punjab province of Pakistan.[1] The dish developed after the red kidney bean was brought to the Indian subcontinent from Mexico.[3] Rajma Chawal is kidney beans served with boiled rice. Rajma is a popular dish in the Northern states of India, as well as in Pakistan and Nepal.[1][4] Some of the best Rajma is said to be grown in the north Indian states of Himachal Pradesh, Uttarakhand, and the Jammu region of Jammu and Kashmir. Rajma Chawal served with chutney of Anardana (pomegranate) is a famous dish in Peerah, a town in Ramban district of Jammu and Kashmir, and Assar/Baggar in Doda district of Jammu and Kashmir.[citation needed] Going further, the Rajma of Chinta Valley in Doda district, a short distance from the town of Bhaderwah of Jammu province are said to be amongst the most popular. These are smaller in size than most Rajma grown in plains and have a slightly sweetish taste.[5] The combination of rajma and rice is generally listed as a top favorite of North Indians and Nepalis.[4] Rajma is prepared with onion, garlic and many spices in India, and it is one of the staple foods in Nepal. Rajma Masala is a popular dish in the Northern states of India, as well as in Pakistan. The Punjabi way of cooking Rajma Masala is to soak the kidney beans overnight in water, cook them in a pressure cooker and then mix in bhuna masala made with chopped onions, diced tomatoes, ginger, garlic and a m\u00e9lange of spices including cumin, coriander, turmeric, garam masala and chili powder.[6] A 100 grams (3.5\u00a0oz) serving of boiled Rajma beans contains about 140 calories, 5.7 grams (0.20\u00a0oz) of protein, 5.9 grams (0.21\u00a0oz) of fat and 18 grams (0.63\u00a0oz) of carbohydrate.[3]", "Sheer Khorma": " Sheer khurma or sheer khorma (Persian: \u0634\u064a\u0631 \u062e\u0631\u0645\u0627, romanized:\u00a0sh\u00eer xorm\u00e2 \"milk and dates\")[1] is a festival vermicelli pudding prepared by Muslims on Eid ul-Fitr[2][3] and Eid al-Adha in  Pakistan, Afghanistan, and parts of Central Asia. It is equivalent to shemai, a Bangladeshi dessert. It is a traditional Muslim festive breakfast,[a] and a dessert for celebrations. This dish is made from various dry fruits, vermicelli, condensed milk, sugar etc. Depending on the region, cardamom, pistachios, almonds, cloves, saffron, raisins, and rose water are also added. This special dish is served on the morning of Eid day in the family after the Eid prayer as breakfast, and throughout the day to all the visiting guests. In its original form, it consists of dates mixed with milk[1] from Iran and dry fruits and nuts from Afghanistan which is where it originated.[5] It is modified in India by the addition of fried semia and caramelised sugar.[5] The main ingredients used in sheer khurma are vermicelli, whole milk, sugar and dates.[6] Depending on the region, cardamom, pistachios, almonds, cloves, saffron, raisins, and rose water are also added.[7] Vermicelli are fried in clarified butter.[8] Then milk (sheer) is added and the vermicelli are allowed to cook further.[8] As the mixture thickens, sugar and dates are added along with any other dried fruits.[8] In some areas locals opt to use a higher milk to vermicelli ratio because they prefer a thinner drink like consistency[9]  This Indian cuisine\u2013related article is a stub.

The flavour of the dish can be attributed to red chillies, but the exact set of ingredients for the recipe can vary. It is prepared using boneless chicken and is usually served with an onion and lemon garnish. Vegetarian variants like \"Paneer 65\" or \"Gobi 65\" use paneer or cauliflower instead. While the name \"Chicken 65\" is universally used to refer to the dish, there are many different theories claiming its origins. Although Chicken 65 is well established as being the invention of A. M. Buhari of the Buhari Hotel chain,[2] its popularity as a dish has spawned several myths about its origin and name. One account claims that the dish emerged as a simple meal for Indian soldiers in 1965. Another account claims that it is a dish containing 65 chili peppers devised by an enterprising hotelier. It is also claimed to relate to a requirement for the meat to be from 65-day-old chickens. Still others claim that it means 65 pieces of chicken. [3][4]", "Sev": "Sev or SEV may refer to:", "Panir": " Paneer (pronounced [/p\u0259\u02c8ni\u02d0r/]), also known as ponir (pronounced [po\u032fni\u032fr]), is a fresh acid-set cheese common in the cuisine of the Indian subcontinent made from full-fat buffalo milk or cow milk.[1] It is a non-aged, non-melting soft cheese made by curdling milk with a fruit- or vegetable-derived acid, such as lemon juice. The word paneer entered English from the Hindi-Urdu term pan\u012br, which comes from Persian panir (\u067e\u0646\u06cc\u0631) 'cheese', which comes from Old Iranian.[2][3] Armenian panir (\u057a\u0561\u0576\u056b\u0580), Azerbaijani p\u0259ndir, Bengali ponir (\u09aa\u09a8\u09bf\u09b0), Turkish peynir and Turkmen pe\u00fdnir, all derived from Persian panir, also refer to cheese of any type.[4] The origin of paneer is debated. Ancient Indian, Afghan-Iranian and Portuguese origins have been proposed for paneer.[5][6] Acidulation of milk was taboo in the ancient Indo-Aryan culture, making an Indian origin unlikely; legends about Krishna make several references to milk, butter, ghee and dahi (yogurt), but do not mention sour milk cheese.[7] According to Arthur Berriedale Keith, a kind of cheese is \"perhaps referred to\" in Rigveda 6.48.18.[8] However, Otto Schrader (1890) believes that the Rigveda only mentions \"a skin of sour milk, not cheese in the proper sense\".[9] Vedic literature refers to a substance that is interpreted by some authors, such as K. T. Achaya, Om Prakash and Sanjeev Kapoor, as a possible form of paneer, but without definitive evidence.[5] Catherine Donnelly, author of The Oxford Companion to Cheese (2016), mentions that Vedic literature refers to cheese production made with the aid of barks of palash tree (Butea monosperma), fruits like jujube (Ziziphus mauritiana) and creeper like putika with coagulating enzymes, \"as well as Dadhanvat, a cheese-like substance made with and without pores\". According to Catherine Donnelly, these plant substances may have contained rennet-like enzymes and notes that the \"Vedas may include some of the earliest known references to rennet-coagulated cheeses\".[10] Lokopakara text dated to the 10th century gives two recipes for coagulated cheeses made from buffalo milk for making sweets using plants and roots. According to the text, buffalo milk was coagulated using roots of amaranth plant or leaves of marsh barbel (Hygrophila auriculata); the soft cheese produced in this manner was called Haluvuga. In the second recipe, buffalo milk was coagulated with Indian mallow (Abutilon indicum) or country mallow (Sida cordifolia) and was made into balls for sweets.[11] Manasollasa, a Sanskrit-language text by the 12th-century king Someshvara III, describes Kshiraprakara, a similar sweet food prepared from milk solids after separating boiled milk using a sour substance.[12] Another theory is that like the word itself, paneer originated in Persianate lands and spread to the Indian subcontinent under Muslim rule.[13] Paneer, according to this theory, was developed and moulded to suit local tastes under these rulers, and the Delhi Sultanate and Mughal Empire are when paneer as currently known developed. Another theory states that paneer is Afghan in origin and spread to India from the lands that make up Afghanistan.[13] National Dairy Research Institute states that paneer was introduced into India by Afghan and Iranian invaders.[14] Based on texts such as Charaka Samhita, BN Mathur wrote that the earliest evidence of a heat-acid coagulated milk product in India can be traced to 75\u2013300 CE, in the Kushan-Satavahana era.[15] Sunil Kumar et al.(2011) interpret this product as the present-day paneer. According to them, paneer is indigenous to the north-western part of South Asia and was introduced in India by Afghan and Iranian travellers.[1] Another theory is that the Portuguese may have introduced the technique of \"breaking\" milk with acid to Bengal in the 17th century. Thus, according to this theory, Indian acid-set cheeses such as paneer and chhena were first prepared in Bengal, under Portuguese influence.[7][16][17] A type of smoked cheese called Bandel cheese was introduced by the Portuguese in Bengal, which is distinct from paneer.[18] Paneer is prepared by adding food acid, such as lemon juice, vinegar, citric acid or dahi (yogurt),[21] to hot milk to separate the curds from the whey. The curds are drained in muslin or cheesecloth and the excess water is pressed out. The resulting paneer is dipped in chilled water for 2\u20133 hours to improve its texture and appearance. From this point, the preparation of paneer diverges based on its use and regional tradition. In North Indian cuisines, the curds are wrapped in cloth, placed under a heavy weight such as a stone slab for two to three hours, and then cut into cubes for use in curries. Pressing for a shorter time (approximately 20 minutes) results in a softer, fluffier cheese. In Bengali, Odia and other East Indian cuisines, the chhena are beaten or kneaded by hand into a dough-like consistency, heavily salted and hardened to produce paneer (called ponir), which is typically eaten in slices at teatime with biscuits or various types of bread, deep-fried in a light batter or used in cooking. In the area surrounding the city of Surat in Gujarat, surti paneer is made by draining the curds and ripening them in whey for 12 to 36 hours. Paneer is the most common type of cheese used in traditional cuisines from the Indian subcontinent. It is sometimes wrapped in dough and deep-fried or served with either spinach (palak paneer) or peas (mattar paneer). Paneer dishes can be sweet, like shahi paneer, or spicy/hot, like chilli paneer. Some paneer recipes include: Anari, a fresh mild whey cheese produced in Cyprus, is very similar in taste and texture to fresh Indian paneer. Circassian cheese is produced using a similar method and is close in consistency to paneer, but is usually salted. Farmer cheese (pressed curds) and firm versions of quark are similar except that they are made from cultured milk and may be salted. Although many Indians translate \"paneer\" into \"cottage cheese\", cottage cheese is made using rennet extracted from the stomach of ruminants, and cow's skim milk. Queso blanco or queso fresco are often recommended as substitutes in the Americas and Spain as they are more commercially available in many American markets. Queso blanco can be a closer match, as it is acid-set while queso fresco frequently uses rennet at a lower temperature. Both are generally salted, unlike paneer. It is also similar to unsalted halloumi.", "Ras Gulla": " Rasgulla (literally \"syrup filled ball\")[a] is a syrupy dessert popular in the eastern part of South Asia. It is made from ball-shaped dumplings of chhena dough, cooked in light sugar syrup. This is done until the syrup permeates the dumplings. While it is near-universally agreed upon that the dessert originated in the eastern Indian subcontinent, the exact locus of origin is disputed between locations such as West Bengal,[1][2] and Odisha,[3] where it is offered at the Puri Jagannath Temple.[4] In 2017, when West Bengal got its rosogolla's geographical indication (GI) status, the Registry Office of India clarified that West Bengal was given GI status for Banglar rosogolla and Odisha can claim it too if they cite the place of origin of their variant along with colour, texture, taste, juice content and method of manufacturing.[5][6] In 2019, the government of Odisha was granted the GI status for \"Odisha rasagola\" (Odia rasagola).[7][8][9] The dessert is pronounced [r\u0254\u0283o\u0261ol\u02d0a] in Bengali, and pronounced [\u027e\u0254s\u0254\u0261ola] in Odia and pronounced [r\u0250s\u0250\u0261o\u02d0l\u0250k\u0250m] in Sanskrit. Rasgulla is derived from the words ras (\"juice\") and gulla (\"ball\").[10] Other names for the dish include rasagulla,[11] rossogolla,[12] roshogolla,[13] rasagola,[14] rasagolla,[15] and rasbhari or rasbari (Nepali).[16] According to historians of Odisha, the rasgulla originated in Puri, as khira mohana, which later evolved into the Pahala rasgulla.[17] It has been traditionally offered as bhog to goddess Lakshmi at Jagannath Temple, Puri.[18] According to the local legend, Lakshmi gets upset because her husband Lord Jagannath goes on a 9-day sojourn (the ratha yatra) without her consent. So, she locks Jai Vijay Dwar, one of the temple gates and prevents his convoy from re-entering the Garbhag\u1e5bha (sanctum sanctorum) of the temple. To appease her, Jagannath offers her rasgullas. This ritual, known as Bachanika, is part of the \"Niladri Bije\" (or \"Arrival of the God\") observance, which marks the return of the deities to the temple after the Ratha Yatra.[19][20] The Jagannath Temple scholars such as Laxmidhar Pujapanda and researchers like Jagabandhu Padhi state that the tradition has existed since the 12th century, when the present-day temple structure was first built.[21][22] Pujapanda states that the Niladri Bije tradition is mentioned in Niladri Mahodaya, which is dated to the 18th century by Sarat Chandra Mahapatra.[21][23] According to Mahapatra, several temple scriptures, which are over 300 years old, provide the evidence of rasgulla offering ritual in Puri.[24] According to folklore, Pahala (a village on the outskirts of Odisha's capital Bhubaneswar) had a large number of cows. The village would produce excess milk, and the villagers would throw it away when it became spoilt. When a priest from the Jagannath Temple saw this, he taught them the art of curdling, including the recipe for rasagulla. Pahala thus went on to become the biggest market for chhena-based sweets in the area.[25] According to Asit Mohanty, an Odia research scholar on Jagannath cult and traditions, the sweet is mentioned as \"Rasagola\" in the 15th-century text Jagamohana Ramayana of Balaram Das.[26][27][28][29][30] The text mentions rasagola along with other sweets found in Odisha. There is also mention of many other cheese sweets like chhenapuri, chhenaladu and rasabali.[31][32] Another ancient text Premapanchamruta of Bhupati also mentions cheese (chhena).[33] It is being argued that cheese making process was well known before coming of Portuguese in Odisha. According to the Bengali culinary historian Pritha Sen, in the mid-18th century, many Odia cooks were employed in Bengali homes who arguably have introduced Rasgulla along with many other Odia dishes, but there is no substantial claim to prove that.[17] According to another theory, it is possible that the Bengali visitors to Puri might have carried the recipe for rasgulla back to Bengal in the nineteenth century. But no substantial claim regarding that was ever found by any historian or anyone else.[34] This claim is contested by Bengali historians.  According to food historians K. T. Achaya and Chitra Banerji, there are no references to cheese (including chhena) in India before the 17th century. The milk-based sweets were mainly made up of khoa, before the Portuguese influence led to the introduction of cheese-based sweets. Therefore, the possibility of a cheese-based dish being offered at Jagannath Temple in the 12th century is highly unlikely.[35] According to Nobin Chandra Das' descendant Animikh Roy and historian Haripada Bhowmik, rasgulla is not even mentioned as one of the chhappan bhog (\"56 offerings\") in the early records of the Temple; the name of the sweet was coined in Bengal. They also state that it would have been a blasphemy to offer something made from spoiled milk (chhena) to a deity.[21][36] However, Michael Krondl argues that Hindu dietary rules vary from region to region, and it is possible that this restriction did not exist in present-day Odisha. But at the same time, he could not give any substantial information to uphold the claim that he was forwarding.[37] The spongy, white r\u00f4\u015b\u00f4golla is believed to have been introduced in present-day West Bengal in 1868 by a Kolkata-based confectioner named Nobin Chandra Das.[38][39] Das started making r\u00f4\u015b\u00f4golla by processing the mixture of chhena and semolina in boiling sugar syrup in contrast to the mixture sans semolina in the original r\u00f4\u015b\u00f4golla in his sweet shop located at Sutanuti (present-day Bagbazar). Yet another theory is that r\u00f4\u015b\u00f4golla was first prepared by someone else in Bengal, and Das only popularised it. In Banglar Khabar (1987), food historian Pranab Ray states that a man named Braja Moira had introduced r\u00f4\u015b\u00f4golla in his shop near Calcutta High Court in 1866, two years before Das started selling the dish.[40] In1906, Panchana Bandopadhyay wrote that r\u00f4\u015b\u00f4golla was invented in the 19th century by Haradhan Moira, a Phulia-based sweetmaker who worked for the Pal Chowdhurys of Ranaghat.[41] According to Mistikatha, a newspaper published by West Bengal Sweetmeat Traders Association, many other people prepared similar sweets under different names such as gopalgolla (prepared by Gopal Moira of Burdwan district), jatingolla, bhabanigolla and rasugolla.[40] Food historian Michael Krondl states that irrespective of its origin, the r\u00f4\u015b\u00f4golla likely predates Nobin Chandra Das. A sales brochure of the company run by Das' descendants also hints at this: \"it is hard to tell whether or not cruder versions of similar sweets existed anywhere at that time. Even if they did, they did not match the quality of Nobin Chandra, and having failed to excite the Bengali palate, they slipped into oblivion.\"[37] Bhagwandas Bagla, a Marwari businessman and a customer of Nobin Chandra Das, popularised the Bengali r\u00f4\u015b\u00f4golla beyond the shop's locality by ordering huge amounts.[42] In 1930, the introduction of vacuum packing by Nobin Chandra's son Krishna Chandra Das led to the availability of canned Rasgullas, which made the dessert popular outside Kolkata, and subsequently, outside India.[43] Krishna Chandra's son Sarada Charan Das established the K.C. Das Pvt Ltd company in 1946.[44] Sarada Charan's younger, estranged son Debendra Nath established K.C. Das Grandsons  in 1956. Today, canned rasgullas are available throughout India, Pakistan and Bangladesh, as well as in South Asian grocery stores outside the Indian subcontinent. In Nepal, Rasgulla became popular under the name Rasbari.[16] The Indian space agency, ISRO, is developing dehydrated rasgullas and other dishes for Indian astronauts in its planned crewed missions.[45] In 2015, the Odisha government initiated a move to get Geographical indication (GI) status for the rasagulla made in Pahala.[21] On 30 July, the people of Odisha celebrated \"Rasagola Dibasa\" (\"Rasgulla Day\") to reaffirm Odisha as the place of the dish's origin.[46] In August, West Bengal decided to legally contest Odisha's move to obtain GI Status.[36] In 2015 The Odisha state government constituted three committees to claim over the rasgulla. The committees submitted their interim report to the government. Noted journalist and food researcher Bhakta Tripathy and a member of the committee had submitted dossier containing historical evidence of rasgulla origin in Odisha.[47] The Science and Technology department of the West Bengal government also started the process to get its own GI status for the dessert.[48] On 30 July 2015, on the day of \"Niladri Bije\", a social media campaign was started by using the hashtag #RasagolaDibasa and it later became a mainstream celebration as the first day to celebrate Rasgulla's origin to be Odisha.[14][46][49] Odia newspaper Sambad and FM radio Radio Choklate in collaboration with the confectioners of Pahala celebrated a rasgulla exhibition-cum-awareness event in Bhubaneswar. Sand artist Sudarshan Patnaik made a sand sculpture in Puri Beach depicting \"Niladri Bije\" and Jagannath offering rasgulla to Lakshmi.[50] It has been agreed upon to celebrate the Rasagola Dibasa every year on the tithi of Niladri Bije in the lunar calendar. In the year 2016, the Rasagola Dibasa has been celebrated on 17 July.[51] To pay tribute to the inventor of rosogolla, \u2018Nobin Chandra Das\u2019, and to promote Bengali claim of authenticity over rosogolla, from 2017 the government of West Bengal has decided to celebrate \"Rosogolla Utsob\" every year on 28 December.[52] And in the 2017 rosogolla festival, Bengali confectioners prepared the world's largest rasgulla, which weighed nine kilograms.[53][54] To celebrate the 150th anniversary of rosogolla's invention, the government of West Bengal had also organised a three-day grand \u2018Rosogolla festival\u2019 from 28 December 2018 to 30 December 2018. To prepare rasgulla, the cheese (chhena) mixture is formed into small balls. These balls are then simmered in a sugar syrup.[55] It can also be prepared using a pressure cooker[56] or an oven.[57] While serving, a drop of rose water (only organic and edible type of rose water, not rose perfume or synthetic flavours) can be added. Along with chhena gaja and chhena poda, rasgulla is one of three traditional Odia chhena desserts. Due to rasgulla becoming associated with Bengali cuisine, the Odisha Milk Federation has tried to popularise chhena poda as the signature Odia dessert.[59][60] Typically, a 100-gram serving of rasgulla contains 186 calories, out of which about 153 calories come from carbohydrates. It also contains about 1.85\u00a0grams of fat and 4\u00a0grams of protein.[61] In 2015, West Bengal applied for a Geographical Indication (GI) status for \"Banglar Rasogolla\" (Bengali Rasgulla). The Government clarified that there was no conflict with Odisha, and its application was only for a specific variant which was different in \"both in colour, texture, taste, juice content and method of manufacturing\" from the variant produced in Odisha. And the same goes for the Odisha Rasgulla, which can be claimed as a variant of the Bengali Rasagulla.[62] On 14 November 2017, the GI Registry of India granted West Bengal the GI status for Banglar Rasogolla.[5][63][64] The GI Registrar office at Chennai later specifically clarified that West Bengal was given GI status only for the Bengali version of Rasgulla (\"Banglar Rasogolla\"), not for the sweet's origin. The office also stated that Odisha had not by then applied for any GI tag, but it could also get Odisha Rasgulla's GI tag by presenting the necessary evidence.[5] In 2018 Odisha applied for GI status in Chennai GI Registry.[65] On 29 July 2019, the GI Registry of India granted Odisha the GI status for \"Odisha Rasagola\", which is the Odia version of Rasgulla.[7][8] Hot, cold, or room temperature", "Upma": " Upma, uppumavu, or uppittu is a dish of thick porridge from dry-roasted semolina or coarse rice flour.[1]\nIt originates from India, most common in Kerala, Andhra Pradesh, Tamil Nadu, Telangana,[2] Karnataka, Maharashtrian, and Sri Lankan Tamil dish. Various seasonings and/or vegetables are often added during the cooking, depending on individual preferences. Upma is known for being a quick meal, served for breakfast or dinner. The different names for the dish derive from the combinations of the word uppu, meaning salt in Tamil and mavu meaning ground grain meal in Tamil.[3] In North India, the dish is called upma. In Maharashtra, the dish traditionally had the name saanja in Marathi. Upma is typically made by first lightly dry roasting semolina (called rava or sooji in India). The semolina is then taken off the fire and kept aside while spices, lentils, onion, ginger, etc are saut\u00e9ed in oil or ghee. The semolina is then added back to the pan and mixed thoroughly. Boiling water is added, and the mixture is stirred until the semolina absorbs the liquid and becomes fluffy in texture.[6][7] There are several ways in which upma is made, and the variations are obtained by either adding or removing spices and vegetables. The texture can vary significantly as well, depending on how much water is added to it, and how long the mixture is allowed to remain on the flame thereafter. The most popular version with wide variations of upma is made with whole or refined ground semolina made out of durum wheat. Sometimes a wide range of vegetables may be added, and may be garnished with a variety of beans (raw or sprouted), cashews and peanuts.  For a variation called masala upma (known as kharabath in Karnataka), sambar masala or garam masala is added along with red chilli powder, instead of green chillies. This variety is more popular in Karnataka, Maharastra, Tamil Nadu and parts of Andhra Pradesh and is usually served in South Indian restaurants. Uppumavu paired with hand-mashed banana is a common breakfast item in Kerala homes. Whole wheat or wheat dalia (cracked wheat) is a common variation of upma in Tamil Nadu, where it is eaten for breakfast or dinner. Sometimes it is cooked with vegetables like peas, carrots, and beans. Upma pesarattu is the most popular version in Andhra Pradesh, Yanam and Telangana. The dish contains upma and pesarattu combined. The upma is eaten by wrapping it in the pesarattu.[8][9] Rice upma, which is mainly popular in Tamil Nadu and southern parts of Karnataka, is referred to as akki tari uppittu (rice coarse flour uppittu). Another variant of upma is prepared with grated coconut instead of onions, especially on holy days, when onion is avoided. This type of upma is generally smeared with ghee at the end of preparation. Dishes similar to upma can be made by substituting small crumbs of leftover bread or idli instead of flour. Upma made from coarser rava known as sajjige is a dish of Udupi cuisine. It is sometimes served along with snacks such as saut\u00e9ed and spiced poha or chevdo. Another variation, particularly as a breakfast dish, is corn upma, eaten with milk and nuts.[10] In Karnataka, upma is also served with another common sweet dish of Karnataka, kesari bhath (\u0c95\u0cc7\u0cb8\u0cb0\u0cbf \u0cac\u0cbe\u0ca4\u0ccd), with a scoop of each on one plate, in a presentation commonly called \"chow chow bath\". In Kerala and Andhra Pradesh, upma is made with flattened rice as a substitute for semolina. This dish is popularly called as Aval upmavu in Malayalam (\u0d05\u0d35\u0d7d \u0d09\u0d2a\u0d4d\u0d2a\u0d41\u0d2e\u0d3e\u0d35\u0d4d) and Atukulu upma (\u0c05\u0c1f\u0c41\u0c15\u0c41\u0c32\u0c41 \u0c09\u0c2a\u0c4d\u0c2e\u0c3e) in Telugu. This variant is also known as aval upma in the Chennai region when made with rice flakes similar to poha. A popular light evening snack is upma made with vermicelli and tomato, peas and carrot. In most parts of Odisha, a popular breakfast consists of sooji upma served with ghugni.", "Neyyappam": "Neyyappam (\u0d28\u0d46\u0d2f\u0d4d\u0d2f\u0d2a\u0d4d\u0d2a\u0d02) or Yeriyappa Zuhoor is a sweet rice-based fritter fried in ghee. Neyyappam has its origins in the southern Indian state of Kerala and coastal Karnataka. The name is derived from the words neyy (\u0d28\u0d46\u0d2f\u0d4d\u0d2f\u0d4d) meaning \"ghee\" (clarified butter) and appam (\u0d05\u0d2a\u0d4d\u0d2a\u0d02) meaning \"pancake\". Neyyappam is typically made of rice flour (alternatively, with semolina), jaggery, ghee-fried coconut (pieces or grated), ghee, cardamom and milk. \nIt is served as a tea time snack usually in the evenings. Neyyappam is also served as offering in Hindu temples in Kerala.[1] It is mainly main during Navaratri and Kartika Deepotsava. This practice has also been adopted by some sections of Christians in Kerala.[2][3] Unni appam is a variant in which mashed ripe plantains or bananas are added to the batter and fried to result in a ball-like shape. Neyyappam became a topic of discussion as its name was shown on the home page of the Android N naming campaign.[4][5] The official video of Google about naming Android N[6] also shows a glimpse of neyyappam and Kerala tourism made a tweet about this naming campaign. In traditional Kerala cuisine, Neyyappam is cooked in a bronze pan called appakara (ml:\u0d05\u0d2a\u0d4d\u0d2a\u0d15\u0d4d\u0d15\u0d3e\u0d30) [1] (also known as Paniyaram Pan in Tamil Nadu), about 8 inches in diameter, having three or more large cavities and thereby giving the dish a tortoise-like shape. It can also be cooked on a griddle or in a skillet. Recipes vary from place to place, especially the ingredients chosen to prepare the batter.", "Milk Rice": "Milk rice may refer to:", "Gujiya": "Gujhia, also known as Gughara, Pedakiya, Purukiya, Karanji, Kajjikayalu, Somas, and Karjikayi, is a sweet, deep-fried pastry that is a popular dessert in the Indian subcontinent. This delicacy is made using either suji (semolina) or maida (all-purpose flour), which is stuffed with a mixture of sweetened khoa (milk solids, also called mawa) and dried fruits. The dumpling is then fried in ghee to give it a crispy texture. The earliest mention of gujiya dates back to the 13th century, when a jaggery-honey mixture was covered with wheat flour and was sun-dried. The preparation method of a typical gujiya/pedakiya is rather similar to that of a samosa, but the gujiya/pedakiya looks like an empanada. Shaped like a half moon, the gujiya or pedakiya is filled with a sweet mixture of grated and roasted dried fruits, khoa, grated coconut, and a hint of suji to lend it a grainy texture. Gujhias are particularly popular in the Uttar Pradesh, Rajasthan, Gujarat, and Bihar regions of India, where they are prepared during Holi and Diwali festivities. In Bihar, dry ones are called Pedakiya and are very popular, particularly during Chhath. There are two types of pedakiya made in Bihar: one with suji/rawa (semolina) and another with khoa.[1] In suji pedakiya, suji is roasted in ghee with sugar, almonds, cardamom, raisins, and other nuts and then deep-fried in ghee. In khoa pedakiya, pure khoa is mixed with nuts and sugar and then deep-fried. Similar dishes are found in several regional cuisines in India, such as Ghughra (Gujarati) in Gujarat, Karanji (Marathi) in Maharashtra, Somas (Tamil) in Tamil Nadu, Garijalu (Telugu) in Telangana, Kajjikayalu(\u0c15\u0c1c\u0c4d\u0c1c\u0c3f\u0c15\u0c3e\u0c2f\u0c32\u0c41) (Telugu) in Andhra Pradesh, and Karjikayi or Karigadubu (Kannada) in Karnataka. All of these dishes are fried sweet dumplings made of wheat flour and stuffed with dry or moist coconut delicacies. In Goa, nevri or neuri (plural neureo) is a similar sweet prepared on the occasion of their festivals, such as Ganesh Chaturthi for Hindus and Christmas for Christians.", "Bhatura": " Bhatura (also known as batoora, bhatoora, batura, or pathora) (Hindi: \u092d\u091f\u0942\u0930\u093e, Punjabi: \u0a2d\u0a1f\u0a42\u0a30\u0a3e) is a fluffy deep-fried leavened sourdough bread originating from the Indian subcontinent.[1] It is commonly served as a midday meal or a breakfast dish in northern and eastern India.[1] Paired with chickpea curry (called chole or channe), it forms a traditional dish called chole bhature. This bread is like the puri bread but is made with leavened dough.[2] A typical recipe includes all-purpose flour (maida), dahi (yogurt), ghee or oil, and either yeast or baking powder. Once kneaded well, the dough is left to rise, and then small balls of this dough are either hand-rolled or flattened using a rolling pin. The bread pieces are then deep fried until they puff up into a lightly browned, soft, fluffy bread, which is elastic and chewy.[3] Bhatura is often eaten with yogurt, pickle, or vegetables. When eaten with chole, it forms a popular traditional dish known as chole bhature.[1][4] A variation of this dish is to use semolina flour instead of all purpose flour. [5] Other variations include aloo bhatura (bhatura filled with potato) and paneer bhatura (bhatura filled with paneer). A nonfried variant is the kulcha, which can be baked or cooked on a flat pan and is garnished with coriander leaves.  This Indian cuisine\u2013related article is a stub.

There are varieties of lemonade found throughout the world.[1] In North America and South Asia, cloudy lemonade is a common variety. It is traditionally a homemade drink using lemon juice, water, and a sweetener such as cane sugar, simple syrup, maple syrup or honey.[2] In the United Kingdom, Ireland, Central Europe, South Africa, Australia, and New Zealand, a carbonated lemonade soft drink is more common. Despite the differences between the drinks, each is known simply as \"lemonade\" in countries where it is dominant. The suffix \"-ade\" may also be applied to other similar drinks made with different fruits, such as limeade, orangeade, or cherryade.[3] A drink made with lemons, dates, and honey was consumed in Mamluk Egypt, including a lemon juice drink with sugar, known as qatarmizat.[4] In 1676, a company known as Compagnie de Limonadiers sold lemonade in Paris.[5] Vendors carried tanks of lemonade on their backs and dispensed cups of the soft drink to Parisians.[6] While carbonated water was invented by Joseph Priestley in 1767 (with his pamphlet Directions for Impregnating Water with Fixed Air published in London in 1772),[7] the first reference found to carbonated lemonade was in 1833 when the drink was sold in British refreshment stalls.[8] R. White's Lemonade has been sold in the UK since 1845.[9] The predominant form of lemonade found in the US, Canada, and India, cloudy lemonade, also known as traditional or old fashioned lemonade in the UK and Australia, is non-carbonated and made with fresh lemon juice; however, commercially produced varieties are also available. Generally served cold, cloudy lemonade may also be served hot as a remedy for congestion and sore throats,[10] frozen, or used as a mixer. Traditionally, children in US and Canadian neighborhoods start lemonade stands to make money during summer. The concept has become iconic of youthful summertime Americana to the degree that parodies and variations exist across media. References can be found in comics and cartoons such as Peanuts, and the 1979 computer game Lemonade Stand.[11] A popular variation of traditional lemonade, pink lemonade, is created by adding additional fruit juices, flavors, or food coloring to the recipe. Most store-bought pink lemonade is simply colored with concentrated grape juice or dyes.[12]  Among those using natural colors, grape is the most popular, but cranberry juice, beet juice or syrup made from brightly colored fruits and vegetables such as rhubarb, raspberries, strawberries, or cherries are also used.[13] The origin stories generally associate pink lemonade's invention with traveling circuses in the US.[13]  A 1912 obituary credited the invention of pink lemonade to circus worker Henry E. \"Sanchez\" Allott, saying he had dropped in red cinnamon candies by mistake.[14]  Another origin story credits another circus worker, Pete Conklin, in 1857. His brother, lion tamer George Conklin, tells the story in his 1921 memoir, The Ways of the Circus.[13] According to the story, Conklin's lemonade was a mixture of water, sugar and tartaric acid, with the tub garnished with a single lemon that he repeatedly used for the season.  One day, he ran out of water. Searching desperately, he found a tub of water a bareback rider had recently used to rinse her pink tights. Adding in the sugar, acid and remaining bits of lemon, he offered the resulting mixture as \"strawberry lemonade\" and saw his sales double.[12][15] Real lemons were too expensive for the circus, so artificial substitutes were widely used.[13]  In the past, tartartic acid was commonly used to produce the typical tart flavor.[13]  In the modern era, commercially produced lemonade and powdered mixes tend to rely on citric acid.[13] Though not the term's primary meaning, \"pink lemonade\" can also describe[16][17][18][19][20] \"Indian lemonade\", or lemonade made by soaking dried sumac berries, especially berries of species like Rhus typhina (\"staghorn sumac\"),[21] Rhus aromatica (\"fragrant sumac\", \"lemon sumac\"),[22] Rhus glabra (\"smooth sumac\", \"scarlet sumac\"),[23][24] or Rhus integrifolia (\"lemonade sumac\", \"lemonade berry\");[25] Indian lemonade has a similar pinkish color. The predominant form of lemonade in the UK, Ireland, France, Germany, Switzerland, South Africa and Australia is a clear, lemon-flavoured carbonated beverage. Schweppes, Kirks, R. White's Lemonade and C&C are common brands, and shops usually carry a store-branded lemonade as well.[9] Schweppes uses a blend of lemon and lime oils.[26] Other fizzy drinks, soft-drinks (or pop) which are both lemon and lime flavoured may also sometimes be referred to as lemonade, such as Sprite and 7 Up. There are also speciality flavours, such as Fentimans Rose Lemonade, which is sold in the UK, the US, and Canada. Shandy, a mixture of beer and clear lemonade, is often sold pre-bottled, or ordered in pubs.[27] There are various drinks called brown lemonade. In Northern Ireland, brown lemonade is flavoured with brown sugar.[28] A variant from Venezuela has cane sugar and lime.[29] In India and Pakistan, where it is commonly known as nimbu paani, and in Bangladesh, lemonades may also contain salt or ginger juice called lebur shorbot.[30] Shikanjvi is a traditional lemonade from this region, and can also be flavored with saffron, cumin and other spices.[31][32][33] Limonana, a type of lemonade made from freshly squeezed lemon juice and mint leaves, is a common summer drink in the Middle East.[34] In Northern Africa, a drink called cherbat is made of lemon, mint, and rose water.[citation needed] Switcha is a version of the drink made in the Bahamas and Turks & Caicos that can also be made with limes instead of lemons.[citation needed] In France, it is common for bars or restaurants to offer citron press\u00e9, also called citronnade, an unmixed version of lemonade in which the customer is given lemon juice, syrup and water separately to be mixed in their preferred proportions.[35]", "Mattar Paneer": " Mattar paneer (Hindi: \u092e\u091f\u0930 \u092a\u0928\u0940\u0930), also known as matar paneer, muttar paneer, and mutter paneer,[2][3] is a modern restaurant-style and vegetarian punjabi dish[4][5] consisting of peas and paneer in a tomato-based sauce,[6] spiced with garam masala. It is often served with rice and an Indian type of bread (naan, paratha, poori, or roti depending on region). Various other ingredients are often added, such as potato (aloo), corn, yogurt or cream.[7][8]  This Indian cuisine\u2013related article is a stub.

The fruit is widely appreciated for its characteristic aroma, bright red color, juicy texture, and sweetness. It is consumed in large quantities, either fresh or in such prepared foods as jam, juice, pies, ice cream, milkshakes, and chocolates. Artificial strawberry flavorings and aromas are also widely used in products such as candy, soap, lip gloss, perfume, and many others. The garden strawberry was first bred in Brittany, France, in the 1750s via a cross of Fragaria virginiana from eastern North America and Fragaria chiloensis, which was brought from Chile by Am\u00e9d\u00e9e-Fran\u00e7ois Fr\u00e9zier in 1714.[2] Cultivars of Fragaria \u00d7 ananassa have replaced, in commercial production, the woodland strawberry (Fragaria vesca), which was the first strawberry species cultivated in the early 17th century.[3] From a botanical point of view, the strawberry is not a berry but an aggregate accessory fruit, meaning that the fleshy part is derived not from the plant's ovaries but from the receptacle that holds the ovaries.[4] Each apparent \"seed\" (achene) on the outside of the fruit is actually one of the ovaries of the flower, with a seed inside it.[4] In 2019, world production of strawberries was nine million tons, led by China with 40% of the total. The first garden strawberry was grown in Brittany, France, during the late 18th century.[3] Prior to this, wild strawberries and cultivated selections from wild strawberry species were the common source of the fruit. The strawberry fruit was mentioned in ancient Roman literature in reference to its medicinal use. The French began taking the strawberry from the forest to their gardens for harvest in the 14th century. Charles V of France (r.\u20091364\u20131380) had 1,200 strawberry plants in his royal garden. In the early 15th century western European monks were using the wild strawberry in their illuminated manuscripts. The strawberry is found in Italian, Flemish, and German art, and in English miniatures.[5] The entire strawberry plant was used to treat depressive illnesses. By the 16th century, references of cultivation of the strawberry became more common. People began using it for its supposed medicinal properties and botanists began naming the different species. In England the demand for regular strawberry farming had increased by the mid-16th century. The combination of strawberries and cream was created by Thomas Wolsey in the court of King Henry VIII.[6] Instructions for growing and harvesting strawberries showed up in writing in 1578. By the end of the 16th century three European species had been cited: F. vesca, F. moschata, and F. viridis. The garden strawberry was transplanted from the forests and then the plants would be propagated asexually by cutting off the runners. Two subspecies of F. vesca were identified: F. sylvestris alba and F. sylvestris semperflorens. The introduction of F. virginiana from eastern North America to Europe in the 17th century is an important part of history because it is one of the two species that gave rise to the modern strawberry. The new species gradually spread through the continent and did not become completely appreciated until the end of the 18th century. A French excursion journeyed to Chile in 1712, which led to the introduction of a strawberry plant with female flowers that resulted in the common strawberry. The Mapuche and Huilliche Indians of Chile cultivated the female strawberry species until 1551, when the Spanish came to conquer the land. In 1765, a European explorer recorded the cultivation of F. chiloensis, the Chilean strawberry. At first introduction to Europe, the plants grew vigorously, but produced no fruit.  French gardeners in Brest and Cherbourg around the mid-18th century first noticed that when F. moschata and F. virginiana were planted in between rows of F. chiloensis, the Chilean strawberry would bear abundant and unusually large fruits. Soon after, Antoine Nicolas Duchesne began to study the breeding of strawberries and made several discoveries crucial to the science of plant breeding, such as the sexual reproduction of the strawberry which he published in 1766. Duchesne discovered that the female F. chiloensis plants could only be pollinated by male F. moschata or F. virginiana plants.[7] This is when the Europeans became aware that plants had the ability to produce male-only or female-only flowers. Duchesne determined F. ananassa to be a hybrid of F. chiloensis and F. virginiana. F. ananassa, which produces large fruits, is so named because it resembles the pineapple in smell, taste and berry shape. In England, many varieties of F. ananassa were produced, and they form the basis of modern varieties of strawberries currently cultivated and consumed. Further breeding was also conducted in Europe and America to improve the hardiness, disease resistance, size, and taste.[7] During the Green Revolution of the 1950s, agronomists used selective breeding to expand phenotypic diversity of the garden strawberry. Adoption of perpetual flowering hybrids not sensitive to changes in photoperiod gave higher yields and expansion of production in California.[8] Raw strawberries are 91% water, 8% carbohydrates, 1% protein, and contain negligible fat (table). A 100 grams (3.5\u00a0oz) reference amount of strawberries supplies 33 kilocalories, is a rich source of vitamin C (71% of the Daily Value, DV), a good source of manganese (18% DV), and provides several other vitamins and dietary minerals in small amounts. Strawberries contain a modest amount of essential unsaturated fatty acids in the achene (seed) oil.[11] Garden strawberries contain the dimeric ellagitannin agrimoniin which is an isomer of sanguiin H-6.[12][13] Other polyphenols present include flavonoids, such as anthocyanins, flavanols, flavonols and phenolic acids, such as hydroxybenzoic acid and hydroxycinnamic acid.[11] Strawberries contain fisetin and possess higher levels of this flavonoid than other fruits.[13][14] Although achenes comprise only about 1% of total fresh weight of a strawberry, they contribute 11% of the total polyphenol in the whole fruit; achene phytochemicals include ellagic acid, ellagic acid glycosides, and ellagitannins.[15] Pelargonidin-3-glucoside is the major anthocyanin in strawberries and cyanidin-3-glucoside is found in smaller proportions. Although glucose seems to be the most common substituting sugar in strawberry anthocyanins, rutinose, arabinose, and rhamnose conjugates have been found in some strawberry cultivars.[11] Purple minor pigments consisting of dimeric anthocyanins (flavanol-anthocyanin adducts: catechin(4\u03b1\u21928)pelargonidin 3-O-\u03b2-glucopyranoside, epicatechin(4\u03b1\u21928)pelargonidin 3-O-\u03b2-glucopyranoside, afzelechin(4\u03b1\u21928)pelargonidin 3-O-\u03b2-glucopyranoside and epiafzelechin(4\u03b1\u21928)pelargonidin 3-O-\u03b2-glucopyranoside) can also be found in strawberries.[16] Sweetness, fragrance and complex flavor are favorable attributes.[17] In plant breeding and farming, emphasis is placed on sugars, acids, and volatile compounds, which improve the taste and fragrance of a ripe strawberry.[18] Although often sweet tasting, strawberries actually have relatively low sugar levels compared to other fruits. Esters, terpenes, and furans are the chemical compounds having the strongest relationships to strawberry flavor, sweetness and fragrance, with a total of 31 out of some 360 volatile compounds significantly correlated to favorable flavor and fragrance.[18][19][20] In breeding strawberries for the commercial market in the United States, the volatile compounds, methyl anthranilate and gamma-decalactone prominent in aromatic wild strawberries, are especially desired for their \"sweet and fruity\" aroma characteristics.[19][20] As strawberry flavor and fragrance are characteristics that may appeal to consumers,[19][20][21] they are used widely in a variety of manufacturing, including foods, beverages, confections, perfumes and cosmetics.[22][23] Modern strawberries are octoploid (8 sets of chromosomes).[24] The genome sequence of the garden strawberry was published in 2019.[25] Some people experience an anaphylactoid reaction to eating strawberries.[26] The most common form of this reaction is oral allergy syndrome, but symptoms may also mimic hay fever or include dermatitis or hives, and, in severe cases, may cause breathing problems.[27] Proteomic studies indicate that the allergen may be tied to a protein for the red anthocyanin biosynthesis expressed in strawberry ripening, named Fra a1 (Fragaria allergen1).[28] Homologous proteins are found in birch pollen and apple, suggesting that people may develop cross-reactivity to all three species. White-fruited strawberry cultivars, lacking Fra a1, may be an option for strawberry allergy sufferers. Since they lack a protein necessary for normal ripening by anthocyanin synthesis of red pigments, the mature berries do not turn red like other cultivars.[28] They ripen but remain white, pale yellow or \"golden\", appearing like immature berries; this also has the advantage of making them less attractive to birds. A virtually allergen-free cultivar named 'Sofar' is available.[29][30] Strawberries are often grouped according to their flowering habit.[31][32] Traditionally, this has consisted of a division between \"June-bearing\" strawberries, which bear their fruit in the early summer and \"ever-bearing\" strawberries, which often bear several crops of fruit throughout the season.[32] One plant throughout a season may produce 50 to 60 times or roughly once every three days.[33] Strawberries occur in three basic flowering habits: short-day, long-day, and day-neutral. These describe the day-length sensitivity of the plant and the type of photoperiod that induces flower formation. Day-neutral cultivars produce flowers regardless of the photoperiod.[34] Strawberry cultivars vary widely in size, color, flavor, shape, degree of fertility, season of ripening, liability to disease and constitution of plant.[31] On average, a strawberry has about 200 seeds on its external membrane.[35] Some vary in foliage, while others vary materially in the development of their sexual organs. In most cases, the flowers appear hermaphroditic in structure, but function as either male or female.[36] In addition to being consumed fresh, strawberries can be frozen or made into jam or preserves,[37] as well as dried and used in prepared foods, such as cereal bars.[38] Strawberries and strawberry flavorings are a popular addition to dairy products, such as strawberry milk, strawberry ice cream, strawberry milkshakes/smoothies and strawberry yogurts.[citation needed] In the United Kingdom, \"strawberries and cream\" is a popular dessert consumed at the Wimbledon tennis tournament.[6] Strawberries and cream is also a staple snack in Mexico, usually available at ice cream parlors. In Sweden, strawberries are a traditional dessert served on Midsummer's Eve. Depending on area, strawberry pie, strawberry rhubarb pie, or strawberry shortcake are also common. In Greece, strawberries may be sprinkled with sugar and then dipped in Metaxa, a brandy, and served as a dessert. In Italy, strawberries are used for various desserts and as a common flavoring for gelato (gelato alla fragola).[citation needed] Fresh strawberries are used as cocktail garnishes to add flavor and texture to a drink. Polyphenol extracted from strawberries have been used in Kanazawa, Japan, to create melting-resistant popsicles.[39] In 2021, world production of strawberries was 9.2\u00a0million tonnes, led by China with 37% of the total and the United States and Turkey as other significant producers (table). Due to the relatively fragile nature of the strawberry, approximately 35 percent of the $2.2\u00a0billion United States crop was spoiled in 2020. This led to an Idaho company planning to launch gene-edited strawberries in the near future in an effort to make them more durable. In the U.S., as of 2021[update], it cost growers around $35,000 per acre to plant and $35,000 per acre to harvest strawberries, with more durable berries potentially reducing the rate of spoilage.[41] For purposes of commercial production, plants are propagated from runners and, in general, distributed as either bare root plants or plugs. Cultivation follows one of two general models\u2014annual plasticulture,[42] or a perennial system of matted rows or mounds.[43] Greenhouses produce a small amount of strawberries during the off season.[44] The bulk of modern commercial production uses the plasticulture system. In this method, raised beds are formed each year, fumigated, and covered with plastic to prevent weed growth and erosion. Plants, usually obtained from northern nurseries, are planted through holes punched in this covering, and irrigation tubing is run underneath. Runners are removed from the plants as they appear, to encourage the plants to put most of their energy into fruit development. After harvesting, the plastic is removed and the plants are plowed into the ground.[42][45] Strawberry plants produce more and better fruit when they are young. After a year or two, they decline. Replacing them annually improves yields and enables denser planting.[42][45] However, this necessitates a longer growing season, for the plants to establish themselves.  It also costs more to annually purchase plants, form new mounds, and cover them with (new) plastic.[45] The other major method retains plants for multiple years. This is most common in colder climates. The plants are grown in rows or on mounds.[42][43] This method requires lower investment and lower maintenance, overall.[43] Yields are typically lower than in plasticulture.[43] Another method uses a compost sock. Plants grown in compost socks have been shown to produce significantly more flavonoids, anthocyanins, fructose, glucose, sucrose, malic acid, and citric acid than fruit produced in the black plastic mulch or matted row systems.[46] Similar results in an earlier study conducted by USDA confirms how compost plays a role in the bioactive qualities of two strawberry cultivars.[47] Strawberries may also be propagated by seed, though this is primarily a hobby activity, and is not widely practiced commercially. A few seed-propagated cultivars have been developed for home use, and research into growing from seed commercially is ongoing.[48] Seeds (achenes) are acquired either via commercial seed suppliers, or by collecting and saving them from the fruit. Strawberries can also be grown indoors in strawberry pots.[49] Strawberries will not grow indoors in winter unless aided by a combination of blue and red LED lights.[50] In Florida, winter is the natural growing season and harvesting begins in mid-November.[33] The Kashubian strawberry (Truskawka kaszubska or Kasz\u00ebbsk\u00f4 mal\u00ebna)[51] is the first Polish fruit to be given commercial protection under EU law. It is produced in Kartuzy, Ko\u015bcierzyna and Byt\u00f3w counties and in the municipalities of Przywidz, Wejherowo, Luzino, Szemud, Linia, \u0141\u0119czyce and Cewice in Kashubia. Only the following varieties may be sold as kasz\u00ebbsk\u00f4 mal\u00ebna: Senga Sengana, Elsanta, Honeoye that have been graded as Extra or Class I.[citation needed] Most strawberry plants are now fed with artificial fertilizers, both before and after harvesting, and often before planting in plasticulture.[52] To maintain top quality, berries are harvested at least every other day. The berries are picked with the caps still attached and with at least half an inch of stem left. Strawberries need to remain on the plant to fully ripen because they do not continue to ripen after being picked. Rotted and overripe berries are removed to minimize insect and disease problems. The berries do not get washed until just before consumption.[53] Soil test information and plant analysis results are used to determine fertility practices. Nitrogen fertilizer is needed at the beginning of every planting year. There are normally adequate levels of phosphorus and potash when fields have been fertilized for top yields. To provide more organic matter, a cover crop of wheat or rye is planted in the winter before planting the strawberries. Strawberries prefer a pH from 5.5 to 6.5, so lime is usually not applied.[54] The harvesting and cleaning process has not changed substantially over time. As they are delicate, strawberries are still harvested by hand.[55] Grading and packing often occurs in the field, rather than in a processing facility.[55] In large operations, strawberries are cleaned by means of water streams and shaking conveyor belts. Strawberries are popular in home gardens, and numerous cultivars have been selected for consumption and for exhibition purposes.[56] The following cultivars have gained the Royal Horticultural Society's Award of Garden Merit: In the United States in 2017, the collective commercial production of strawberries, blueberries, raspberries, and blackberries was a $6\u00a0billion industry dominated by the California growing and marketing company Driscoll's.[19] In 2017, strawberries alone were a $3.5\u00a0billion market of which 82% was for fresh fruit.[63] To increase consumer demand in the 21st century, commercial producers of strawberries cultivated them mainly for favorable aroma characteristics similar to those of wild strawberries,[20] in addition to having large size, heart-shape, glossy red exterior, firmness, and slow ripening for long shelf-life favorable to ship by ground transportation from farms to stores nationwide for consumption within two weeks of harvest.[19] In US and Canadian grocery stores, fresh strawberries are typically sold in plastic clamshells, and are among the top fresh produce items in grocery revenues.[19] One marketing analysis identified strawberries and other berries as a source of \"happiness\" for consumers.[19] Around 200 species of pests are known to attack strawberries both directly and indirectly.[64] These pests include slugs, moths, fruit flies, chafers, strawberry root weevils, strawberry thrips, strawberry sap beetles, strawberry crown moth, mites, aphids, and others.[64][65] The caterpillars of a number of species of Lepidoptera feed on strawberry plants. For example, the ghost moth is known to be a pest of the strawberry plant. The strawberry aphid, Chaetosiphon fragaefolii, is a bug species found in the United States (Arizona), Argentina and Chile. It is a vector of the strawberry mild yellow-edge virus. The amounts of pesticides required for industrial production of strawberries (300 pounds (140\u00a0kg) in California per acre) have led to the strawberry leading the list of EWG's \"Dirty Dozen\" of pesticide-contaminated produce.[66] Strawberry plants can fall victim to a number of diseases, especially when subjected to stress.[67][68] The leaves may be infected by powdery mildew, leaf spot (caused by the fungus Sphaerella fragariae), leaf blight (caused by the fungus Phomopsis obscurans), and by a variety of slime molds.[67] The crown and roots may fall victim to red stele, verticillium wilt, black root rot, and nematodes.[67] The fruits are subject to damage from gray mold (Botrytis cinerea), rhizopus rot, and leather rot.[67] To prevent root-rotting, strawberries should be planted every four to five years in a new bed, at a different site.[69] The NPR1 gene from Arabidopsis thaliana, AtNPR1, confers A. thaliana's broad-spectrum resistance when transexpressed in F. ananassa.[70] This resistance includes resistance to anthracnose, powdery mildew, and angular leaf spot.[70] A 1997 study assessed many wound volatiles and found all effective against gray mold (B. cinerea).[71] Both Tribute and Chandler were tested and benefited from the treatments, although there are large differences between the substance x variety effects.[71] Strawberry metabolizes these volatiles, and does so more rapidly than either blackberry or grape.[71] The plants can also develop disease from temperature extremes during winter.[67] Watering strawberry roots, and not the leaves, is preferred as moisture on leaves encourages fungal growth.[72] Strawberries may also often appear conjoined together or deformed due to poor pollination.[73]", "Pongal": "Pongal may refer to:", "Rajma ": " R\u0101jm\u0101[2] [ra\u02d0d\u0292ma\u02d0] (Hindi: \u0930\u093e\u091c\u092e\u093e, Nepali: \u0930\u093e\u091c\u092e\u093e, Urdu: \u0631\u0627\u062c\u0645\u0627), also known as rajmah, r\u0101zm\u0101, or lal lobia, is a vegetarian dish, originating from the Indian subcontinent, consisting of red kidney beans in a thick gravy with many Indian whole spices, and is usually served with rice. It is a part of the regular diet in Northern India, Nepal and Punjab province of Pakistan.[1] The dish developed after the red kidney bean was brought to the Indian subcontinent from Mexico.[3] Rajma Chawal is kidney beans served with boiled rice. Rajma is a popular dish in the Northern states of India, as well as in Pakistan and Nepal.[1][4] Some of the best Rajma is said to be grown in the north Indian states of Himachal Pradesh, Uttarakhand, and the Jammu region of Jammu and Kashmir. Rajma Chawal served with chutney of Anardana (pomegranate) is a famous dish in Peerah, a town in Ramban district of Jammu and Kashmir, and Assar/Baggar in Doda district of Jammu and Kashmir.[citation needed] Going further, the Rajma of Chinta Valley in Doda district, a short distance from the town of Bhaderwah of Jammu province are said to be amongst the most popular. These are smaller in size than most Rajma grown in plains and have a slightly sweetish taste.[5] The combination of rajma and rice is generally listed as a top favorite of North Indians and Nepalis.[4] Rajma is prepared with onion, garlic and many spices in India, and it is one of the staple foods in Nepal. Rajma Masala is a popular dish in the Northern states of India, as well as in Pakistan. The Punjabi way of cooking Rajma Masala is to soak the kidney beans overnight in water, cook them in a pressure cooker and then mix in bhuna masala made with chopped onions, diced tomatoes, ginger, garlic and a m\u00e9lange of spices including cumin, coriander, turmeric, garam masala and chili powder.[6] A 100 grams (3.5\u00a0oz) serving of boiled Rajma beans contains about 140 calories, 5.7 grams (0.20\u00a0oz) of protein, 5.9 grams (0.21\u00a0oz) of fat and 18 grams (0.63\u00a0oz) of carbohydrate.[3]", "Malai Kofta": " Kofta is a family of meatball or meatloaf dishes found in South Asian, Central Asian, Balkan, Middle Eastern, North African, and South Caucasian cuisines. In the simplest form, koftas consist of balls of minced meat\u00a0\u2013 usually beef, chicken, pork, lamb or mutton, or a mixture\u00a0\u2013 mixed with spices and sometimes other ingredients.[1] The earliest known recipes are found in early Arab cookbooks and call for ground lamb. There are many national and regional variations. There are also vegetable and uncooked versions. Shapes vary and include balls, patties, and cylinders. Sizes typically vary from that of a golf ball to that of an orange. In English, kofta is a loanword borrowed from the Hindi-Urdu \u0915\u094b\u092b\u093c\u094d\u0924\u093e / \u06a9\u0648\u0641\u062a\u06c1 and Persian \u06a9\u0648\u0641\u062a\u0647 kofta meaning pounded meat.[2][3][4][1] The earliest extant use of the word in the Urdu language is attested from the year 1665 in Mulla Nusrati's \u02bfAl\u012b\u00a0N\u0101ma.[5][6] It was first used in English in Qanoon-e-Islam in 1832,[7] and then by James Wise in 1883.[8] The languages of the region of the kofta's origin have adopted the word with minor phonetic variations.[9] Similar foods are called in other languages croquettes, dumplings, meatballs, rissoles, and turnovers.[9][10] The ancient Roman cookbook Apicius included many meatball-type recipes.[11] The first appearance of recipes for kofta are in the earliest Arab cookbooks.[12][9] The earliest recipes are for large ground lamb meatballs triple-glazed in a mixture of saffron and egg yolk.[12] This glazing method spread to the West, where it is referred to as \"gilding\" or \"endoring\".[9] Koftas moved to India; according to Alan Davidson, Nargisi Kofta was served at the Mughal court.[9] Koftas are found from the Indian subcontinent through Central Asia, the Middle East, the Balkans, and northern Africa.[9] Koftas are found in the traditional cuisines of Armenia,[13][14] Afghanistan,[13] Albania, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Bulgaria,[9] Georgia,[14] Lebanon, Egypt,[13][14] Greece,[9] India,[9][13][15] Iran, Morocco,[9] Pakistan,[16] Romania,[17] Serbia, North Macedonia, and Turkey.[13][18] Kofta is also a popular dish among Assyrian people.[19] In Turkey, it is \"a preferred offering at communal gatherings of all kinds\", according to Engin Akin.[18] In Armenia and Azerbaijan, it is, along with dolma, lavash, harissa, kebabs, and pahlava, a dish of \"clearly symbolic ethnic significance\" often argued over by gastronationalists attempting to claim it as one of their own country's traditional dishes that has been co-opted by the other country.[14] The basic Ingredient of koftas is usually meat, but they are known for their versatility. There are many different ways to prepare it, like frying, baking, steaming, boiling, or grilling.[20] In traditional preparation methods, kofta is kneaded with fine bulgur and meat, and in some middle eastern countries it is served with the raw meat in the kneaded form. With the inventive fillings that frequently enhance the flavor profile, koftas provide plenty of opportunity for creative culinary experimentation. Often added into the kofta mixture are nuts, cheese, or eggs.[21] Furthermore, koftas come in a broad range of shapes and sizes, from little oval shaped egg size balls to flatly carved rhombuses in trays, or tennis ball sized koftas. In addition to satisfying personal tastes, this variation in size and shape enables creative display and serving possibilities. Generally meat is mixed with spices and often other ingredients such as rice, bulgur, vegetables, or eggs to form a paste.[9] They can be grilled, fried, steamed, poached, baked, or marinated, and may be served with a rich spicy sauce or in a soup or stew.[9] Koftas are sometimes made from fish or vegetables or even cottage cheese  rather than red meat.[22] Some versions are stuffed with nuts, cheese, or eggs.[9] Generally the size can vary from the \"size of an orange to the size of a golf ball\",[23] although some variants are outside that range; tabriz k\u00f6ftesi, which average 20 centimetres (8\u00a0in) in diameter, are the largest.[9] They can be shaped in various forms[10] including patties, balls, or cylinders.[24] Some versions are uncooked.[12]", "Dahi Vada": " Dahi vada is a type of chaat (snack) originating from the Indian subcontinent.[1] It is prepared by soaking vadas (fried lentil balls) in thick dahi (yogurt).[2] Dahi vada is also known as \"dahi vade\" (\u0926\u0939\u0940 \u0935\u0921\u0947) in Marathi, dahi barey/dahi balley (\u062f\u06c1\u06cc \u0628\u06be\u0644\u06d2/\u062f\u06c1\u06cc \u0628\u0691\u06d2) in Urdu, dahi vada (\u0926\u0939\u0940 \u0935\u0921\u093c\u093e) in Hindi, dahi bhalla (\u062f\u06c1\u06cc \u0628\u06be\u0644\u0627/\u0a26\u0a39\u0a40 \u0a2d\u0a71\u0a32\u0a3e) in Punjabi, thayir vadai in Tamil,[3] thairu vada in Malayalam, perugu vada in Telugu, mosaru vade in Kannada, dahi bara (\u0b26\u0b39\u0b3f \u0b2c\u0b30\u0b3e) in Odia and doi bora (\u09a6\u0987 \u09ac\u09a1\u09bc\u09be) in Bengali. A recipe for dahi wada (as kshiravata) is mentioned in Manasollasa, a 12th-century Sanskrit encyclopedia compiled by Someshvara III, who ruled from present-day Karnataka.[4][5] Today, dahi vada is prepared on festival such as Holi.[5][6] Washed urad lentils are soaked overnight and ground into a batter for the vada, then cooked in hot oil.[7] The hot deep-fried vadas are first put in water and then transferred to thick beaten yogurt. The vadas are soaked for a period of time before serving.[7] Additions to the batter may include golden raisins. Vadas may be topped with coriander or mint leaves, chilli powder, crushed black pepper, chaat masala, cumin, shredded coconut, green chilies, boondi, thinly sliced fresh ginger, or pomegranate. Sweeter curd is preferred in some places in India, especially in Maharashtra and Gujarat, although the garnishing remains the same. A combination of coriander and tamarind chutney is often used as a garnish.[7] The batter can be made using chickpea flour too.[8][9] Dahi vada as popular street chaat is found in various cities across India, including Chennai, Bangaluru, Delhi, Mumbai, Jaipur, Kolkata, Cuttack, and Indore. Dahi baray are also found in Pakistan, especially in Karachi.[10][11][12][13]", "Aloo Dum": " Dum aloo (also spelled as dam aloo, Hindi: \u0926\u092e \u0906\u0932\u0942, romanized:\u00a0dam \u0101l\u016b) or aloor dum (Bengali: \u0986\u09b2\u09c1\u09b0 \u09a6\u09ae, romanized:\u00a0\u0101l\u016br dam) or aloo dum (Odia: \u0b06\u0b33\u0b41 \u0b26\u0b2e, romanized:\u00a0\u0101l\u016b dam) is a potato-based curry dish. Dum means slow-cooked, and aloo is potato.[1] It is a part of the traditional  Kashmiri Pandit cuisine,[2][3] from the Kashmir Valley, in the Indian state of Jammu and Kashmir. Dum aloo is cooked widely in India and Pakistan.[4] There are also Banarasi and Bengali variations.[1] The potatoes, usually smaller ones, are first skinned and deep fried.[5] Kashmiri dum aloo sauce is made with yogurt or khoya, and often includes a cashew nut paste.[5] The Banarasi variation sauce is made from tomatoes and onions.[6] Spices such as red chilies, garlic, ginger, cardamom, and fennel are added to the sauce.[7][8]  The potatoes are cooked slowly at low flame in the sauce, and can be garnished with coriander.[9][10] Dum aloo is often paired and served with naan.[6]  This Indian cuisine\u2013related article is a stub. You can help Wikipedia by expanding it.", "Mint chutney": "", "Roti": " Roti (also known as chapati)[5] is a round flatbread originating from the Indian subcontinent. It is commonly consumed in many South Asian, Southeast Asian, Caribbean, and  Southeast African countries. It is made from stoneground whole wheat flour, traditionally known as gehu ka atta, and water that are combined into a dough.[6][7] Its defining characteristic is that it is unleavened. Naan from the Indian subcontinent, by contrast, is a yeast-leavened bread, as is kulcha. Like breads around the world, roti is a staple accompaniment to other foods.[5] The word roti is derived from the Sanskrit word ro\u1e6dik\u0101, meaning \"bread\".[8] Roti is made from a mixture of flour, water, and optionally salt and butter or oil.[10]  They are mixed together to create a dough which is left to rest. The dough is then divided into balls which are flattened with a rolling pin to form rotis. The rotis are then cooked on a tava or pan. Many variations of flatbreads and roti are found in many cultures across the globe, from the Indian subcontinent to Africa to Oceania to the Malay Peninsula to the Americas.[5] The roti is a traditional flatbread from the Indian subcontinent.[11] It is normally eaten with cooked vegetables or curries; it can be used as a carrier for them.[12] It is made most often from wheat flour, cooked on a flat or slightly concave iron griddle called a tawa.[13] Traditionally, rotis have also been made from the flour of millet, maize, jowar, bajra, and even rice.[14] Tandoori roti is cooked by sticking the flattened dough to the inside wall of a tandoor oven, where it bakes quickly at a high temperature.[15][16] Chapatis are made of whole-wheat flour known as atta, mixed into a dough with water, edible oil and optional salt in a mixing utensil called a parat, and is cooked on a tava (flat skillet).[17][18] It is known as phulka in Punjabi and Saraiki, and maani in Sindhi. In Sri Lanka, there is a variant of roti called pol roti (coconut roti),[19] made of wheat flour, and/or kurakkan flour, and scraped coconut. Sometimes, chopped green chilis and onion are added to the mixture before cooking. These are usually thicker and harder than other roti types. They are usually eaten with curries, or some types of sambol or lunu miris and considered a main meal rather than a supplement. Another variety of roti popular in Sri Lanka is kottu roti,[20] which is made up of  paratha or godamba roti, These are cut into small pieces,[20] small in size and rectangular or square in shape. Then on a square heating pan, vegetables and onions are fried. Eggs, cooked meat, or fish are added to fried vegetables and heated for a few minutes. Finally, the pieces of cut paratha are added. These are chopped and mixed by repeated pounding using heavy iron blades/spatula, the sound of which can be heard from a long distance. Depending upon what ingredients are used, the variations are vegetable, egg, chicken, beef, mutton, and fish kottu roti.[21] It is sometimes prepared and served as a fast food dish.[21] Godamba roti is another variety found in Sri Lanka.[22] Plain godamba roti is eaten with curry[22] or it can also be wrapped around a savory filling. Roti is eaten widely across the Caribbean, especially in countries with large Indo-Caribbean populations such as Trinidad and Tobago,  Guyana, Suriname, and Jamaica. Originally brought to the islands by indentured laborers from the Indian subcontinent, roti has become a popular staple in the culturally rich cuisines of these countries. In the Caribbean, roti is commonly eaten as an accompaniment to various curries and stews. The traditional way of eating roti is to break the roti by hand, using it to sop up sauce and pieces of meat from the curry. However, in the Caribbean, the term roti may refer to both the flatbread (roti) itself and the more popular street food item, in which the roti is folded around a savory filling in the form of a wrap. The roti wrap is the commercialization of roti and curry together as a fast-food or street-food item in the Caribbean. This wrap form of roti originated in southern Trinidad. It was first created in the mid-1940s by Sackina Karamath, who later founded Hummingbird Roti Shop in San Fernando, Trinidad and Tobago. The wrap was convenient, as the meal could be eaten faster and while on the go, as well as keeping one's hands from getting dirty. In Trinidad and Tobago, various wrapped roti are served, including chicken, conch, goat, beef, and shrimp. Vegetables can also be added including potato, pumpkin, and spinach as well a variety of local condiments, with pepper sauce (hot sauce) and mango chutney being the most popular. The roti wrap quickly gained popularity across the island and spread throughout the rest of the Caribbean.  The wrap is now simply referred to as a roti or just roti.  The growth in popularity has recently led to referring to the flatbread itself (roti) that surrounds the filling as a \"roti skin\" or \"roti shell\", a practice that is now common in both restaurants and commercial companies. Various types of roti are eaten throughout the West Indies. They are most prominently featured in the diets of people in Trinidad and Tobago, Guyana, and Suriname. Caribbean-style roti is primarily made from wheat flour, baking powder, salt, and water, and cooked on a tawa. Certain rotis are also made with ghee or butter. Dosti roti is common in Guyana.[a] A small amount of fat is placed in each piece of dough before it is rolled out to make the roti softer. Usually, vegetable oil is used, but butter, or margarine can also be used. Ghee is not used in everyday cooking, but is used on special occasions, especially amongst Hindus. The roti is usually clapped by hand or beaten a bit, hot off the tava, so it softens but does not break. In Suriname, roti refers mainly to dhalpuri or aloo puri. It is most often eaten with curried chicken. As in Trinidad and the West Indies, roti can also refer to the stuffed roti wrap. This dish is usually eaten out of hand. Due to a mass emigration of Indian Surinamese in the 1970s, roti became a popular take-out dish in the Netherlands. It usually includes chicken curry, potatoes, a boiled egg, and various vegetables, most notably the kousenband or yardlong bean. Another variation includes shrimp and aubergine. The meat with gravy, potatoes, egg, and yardlong beans are served side by side on a plate, with the aloo puri folded in fours on top. In Indonesia and Malaysia, the term encompasses all forms of bread, including Western-style bread, as well as the traditional Indian breads.[29] In Thailand, \u0e42\u0e23\u0e15\u0e35 is a popular street food that can be eaten as a dessert or as a side dish. Some Thai curries can also be accompanied with a side of roti, primarily Southern Thai curries. In Cambodia, \u179a\u17c9\u17bc\u1791\u17b8 is a dessert that is sold as street food. It is similar to both a cr\u00eape and paratha. Roti was initially introduced to South Africa by Indian migrants during the 19th century, and subsequently became incorporated into Durban cuisine. It is widely eaten by the Indian communities living in South Africa, and is either eaten as a flat bread or a wrap with locally made curries. Roti is also often eaten in Cape Coloured and Cape Malay Communities. Two types of roti are eaten: chapati/flat roti and paratha/flaky roti. Flaky roti is also called Malay roti. When eaten with a curry filling, usually mutton, chicken or mince, the roti is called a Salomie. \nA roti gatsby is a popular takeaway dish where the bread of the filled gatsby, a popular sandwich is replaced several rotis and folded. Similarly as with other countries that were part of the Indian diaspora, roti was introduced to Mauritius by Indian migrants/indentured labourers during the 19th century, and has since been a staple of Mauritian cuisine and a common street food.[30][31] Roti generally refers to farata (a local pronunciation of paratha), a pancake made of wheat flour and water;[30][32] other variants include dholl puri, which is layered, and stuffed with boiled and ground dal/split peas,[30][33] and ti puri, a smaller roti that is fried and usually served with seven different curries.[34] In Iran, the two variants of roti are called khaboos[35][better\u00a0source\u00a0needed] and lavash.  These two breads (the former of which is almost exactly prepared like Indian roti) are quite similar to other rotis. Roti shops are now abundant in Trinidad and Tobago, Guyana, Suriname, Jamaica, the United States, Canada, the United Kingdom, and the Netherlands. Owing to Canada's considerable immigrant populations from both South Asia and the Caribbean, roti and its variants are popular there. As Indo-Caribbeans moved to North American cities such as Toronto, New York City, Miami, Los Angeles, and Montreal, they exported with them the wrapped version of roti. A distinct Toronto offering is the \"East Indian roti\", a variation on the stuffed roti from the West Indies.[36] In some of these cultures, rotis are also being used in the place of pita bread when making burritos, quesadillas, or any other kinds of wraps.[37]", "Poha": "Poha or POHA may refer to:", "Rasgula": " Rasgulla (literally \"syrup filled ball\")[a] is a syrupy dessert popular in the eastern part of South Asia. It is made from ball-shaped dumplings of chhena dough, cooked in light sugar syrup. This is done until the syrup permeates the dumplings. While it is near-universally agreed upon that the dessert originated in the eastern Indian subcontinent, the exact locus of origin is disputed between locations such as West Bengal,[1][2] and Odisha,[3] where it is offered at the Puri Jagannath Temple.[4] In 2017, when West Bengal got its rosogolla's geographical indication (GI) status, the Registry Office of India clarified that West Bengal was given GI status for Banglar rosogolla and Odisha can claim it too if they cite the place of origin of their variant along with colour, texture, taste, juice content and method of manufacturing.[5][6] In 2019, the government of Odisha was granted the GI status for \"Odisha rasagola\" (Odia rasagola).[7][8][9] The dessert is pronounced [r\u0254\u0283o\u0261ol\u02d0a] in Bengali, and pronounced [\u027e\u0254s\u0254\u0261ola] in Odia and pronounced [r\u0250s\u0250\u0261o\u02d0l\u0250k\u0250m] in Sanskrit. Rasgulla is derived from the words ras (\"juice\") and gulla (\"ball\").[10] Other names for the dish include rasagulla,[11] rossogolla,[12] roshogolla,[13] rasagola,[14] rasagolla,[15] and rasbhari or rasbari (Nepali).[16] According to historians of Odisha, the rasgulla originated in Puri, as khira mohana, which later evolved into the Pahala rasgulla.[17] It has been traditionally offered as bhog to goddess Lakshmi at Jagannath Temple, Puri.[18] According to the local legend, Lakshmi gets upset because her husband Lord Jagannath goes on a 9-day sojourn (the ratha yatra) without her consent. So, she locks Jai Vijay Dwar, one of the temple gates and prevents his convoy from re-entering the Garbhag\u1e5bha (sanctum sanctorum) of the temple. To appease her, Jagannath offers her rasgullas. This ritual, known as Bachanika, is part of the \"Niladri Bije\" (or \"Arrival of the God\") observance, which marks the return of the deities to the temple after the Ratha Yatra.[19][20] The Jagannath Temple scholars such as Laxmidhar Pujapanda and researchers like Jagabandhu Padhi state that the tradition has existed since the 12th century, when the present-day temple structure was first built.[21][22] Pujapanda states that the Niladri Bije tradition is mentioned in Niladri Mahodaya, which is dated to the 18th century by Sarat Chandra Mahapatra.[21][23] According to Mahapatra, several temple scriptures, which are over 300 years old, provide the evidence of rasgulla offering ritual in Puri.[24] According to folklore, Pahala (a village on the outskirts of Odisha's capital Bhubaneswar) had a large number of cows. The village would produce excess milk, and the villagers would throw it away when it became spoilt. When a priest from the Jagannath Temple saw this, he taught them the art of curdling, including the recipe for rasagulla. Pahala thus went on to become the biggest market for chhena-based sweets in the area.[25] According to Asit Mohanty, an Odia research scholar on Jagannath cult and traditions, the sweet is mentioned as \"Rasagola\" in the 15th-century text Jagamohana Ramayana of Balaram Das.[26][27][28][29][30] The text mentions rasagola along with other sweets found in Odisha. There is also mention of many other cheese sweets like chhenapuri, chhenaladu and rasabali.[31][32] Another ancient text Premapanchamruta of Bhupati also mentions cheese (chhena).[33] It is being argued that cheese making process was well known before coming of Portuguese in Odisha. According to the Bengali culinary historian Pritha Sen, in the mid-18th century, many Odia cooks were employed in Bengali homes who arguably have introduced Rasgulla along with many other Odia dishes, but there is no substantial claim to prove that.[17] According to another theory, it is possible that the Bengali visitors to Puri might have carried the recipe for rasgulla back to Bengal in the nineteenth century. But no substantial claim regarding that was ever found by any historian or anyone else.[34] This claim is contested by Bengali historians.  According to food historians K. T. Achaya and Chitra Banerji, there are no references to cheese (including chhena) in India before the 17th century. The milk-based sweets were mainly made up of khoa, before the Portuguese influence led to the introduction of cheese-based sweets. Therefore, the possibility of a cheese-based dish being offered at Jagannath Temple in the 12th century is highly unlikely.[35] According to Nobin Chandra Das' descendant Animikh Roy and historian Haripada Bhowmik, rasgulla is not even mentioned as one of the chhappan bhog (\"56 offerings\") in the early records of the Temple; the name of the sweet was coined in Bengal. They also state that it would have been a blasphemy to offer something made from spoiled milk (chhena) to a deity.[21][36] However, Michael Krondl argues that Hindu dietary rules vary from region to region, and it is possible that this restriction did not exist in present-day Odisha. But at the same time, he could not give any substantial information to uphold the claim that he was forwarding.[37] The spongy, white r\u00f4\u015b\u00f4golla is believed to have been introduced in present-day West Bengal in 1868 by a Kolkata-based confectioner named Nobin Chandra Das.[38][39] Das started making r\u00f4\u015b\u00f4golla by processing the mixture of chhena and semolina in boiling sugar syrup in contrast to the mixture sans semolina in the original r\u00f4\u015b\u00f4golla in his sweet shop located at Sutanuti (present-day Bagbazar). Yet another theory is that r\u00f4\u015b\u00f4golla was first prepared by someone else in Bengal, and Das only popularised it. In Banglar Khabar (1987), food historian Pranab Ray states that a man named Braja Moira had introduced r\u00f4\u015b\u00f4golla in his shop near Calcutta High Court in 1866, two years before Das started selling the dish.[40] In1906, Panchana Bandopadhyay wrote that r\u00f4\u015b\u00f4golla was invented in the 19th century by Haradhan Moira, a Phulia-based sweetmaker who worked for the Pal Chowdhurys of Ranaghat.[41] According to Mistikatha, a newspaper published by West Bengal Sweetmeat Traders Association, many other people prepared similar sweets under different names such as gopalgolla (prepared by Gopal Moira of Burdwan district), jatingolla, bhabanigolla and rasugolla.[40] Food historian Michael Krondl states that irrespective of its origin, the r\u00f4\u015b\u00f4golla likely predates Nobin Chandra Das. A sales brochure of the company run by Das' descendants also hints at this: \"it is hard to tell whether or not cruder versions of similar sweets existed anywhere at that time. Even if they did, they did not match the quality of Nobin Chandra, and having failed to excite the Bengali palate, they slipped into oblivion.\"[37] Bhagwandas Bagla, a Marwari businessman and a customer of Nobin Chandra Das, popularised the Bengali r\u00f4\u015b\u00f4golla beyond the shop's locality by ordering huge amounts.[42] In 1930, the introduction of vacuum packing by Nobin Chandra's son Krishna Chandra Das led to the availability of canned Rasgullas, which made the dessert popular outside Kolkata, and subsequently, outside India.[43] Krishna Chandra's son Sarada Charan Das established the K.C. Das Pvt Ltd company in 1946.[44] Sarada Charan's younger, estranged son Debendra Nath established K.C. Das Grandsons  in 1956. Today, canned rasgullas are available throughout India, Pakistan and Bangladesh, as well as in South Asian grocery stores outside the Indian subcontinent. In Nepal, Rasgulla became popular under the name Rasbari.[16] The Indian space agency, ISRO, is developing dehydrated rasgullas and other dishes for Indian astronauts in its planned crewed missions.[45] In 2015, the Odisha government initiated a move to get Geographical indication (GI) status for the rasagulla made in Pahala.[21] On 30 July, the people of Odisha celebrated \"Rasagola Dibasa\" (\"Rasgulla Day\") to reaffirm Odisha as the place of the dish's origin.[46] In August, West Bengal decided to legally contest Odisha's move to obtain GI Status.[36] In 2015 The Odisha state government constituted three committees to claim over the rasgulla. The committees submitted their interim report to the government. Noted journalist and food researcher Bhakta Tripathy and a member of the committee had submitted dossier containing historical evidence of rasgulla origin in Odisha.[47] The Science and Technology department of the West Bengal government also started the process to get its own GI status for the dessert.[48] On 30 July 2015, on the day of \"Niladri Bije\", a social media campaign was started by using the hashtag #RasagolaDibasa and it later became a mainstream celebration as the first day to celebrate Rasgulla's origin to be Odisha.[14][46][49] Odia newspaper Sambad and FM radio Radio Choklate in collaboration with the confectioners of Pahala celebrated a rasgulla exhibition-cum-awareness event in Bhubaneswar. Sand artist Sudarshan Patnaik made a sand sculpture in Puri Beach depicting \"Niladri Bije\" and Jagannath offering rasgulla to Lakshmi.[50] It has been agreed upon to celebrate the Rasagola Dibasa every year on the tithi of Niladri Bije in the lunar calendar. In the year 2016, the Rasagola Dibasa has been celebrated on 17 July.[51] To pay tribute to the inventor of rosogolla, \u2018Nobin Chandra Das\u2019, and to promote Bengali claim of authenticity over rosogolla, from 2017 the government of West Bengal has decided to celebrate \"Rosogolla Utsob\" every year on 28 December.[52] And in the 2017 rosogolla festival, Bengali confectioners prepared the world's largest rasgulla, which weighed nine kilograms.[53][54] To celebrate the 150th anniversary of rosogolla's invention, the government of West Bengal had also organised a three-day grand \u2018Rosogolla festival\u2019 from 28 December 2018 to 30 December 2018. To prepare rasgulla, the cheese (chhena) mixture is formed into small balls. These balls are then simmered in a sugar syrup.[55] It can also be prepared using a pressure cooker[56] or an oven.[57] While serving, a drop of rose water (only organic and edible type of rose water, not rose perfume or synthetic flavours) can be added. Along with chhena gaja and chhena poda, rasgulla is one of three traditional Odia chhena desserts. Due to rasgulla becoming associated with Bengali cuisine, the Odisha Milk Federation has tried to popularise chhena poda as the signature Odia dessert.[59][60] Typically, a 100-gram serving of rasgulla contains 186 calories, out of which about 153 calories come from carbohydrates. It also contains about 1.85\u00a0grams of fat and 4\u00a0grams of protein.[61] In 2015, West Bengal applied for a Geographical Indication (GI) status for \"Banglar Rasogolla\" (Bengali Rasgulla). The Government clarified that there was no conflict with Odisha, and its application was only for a specific variant which was different in \"both in colour, texture, taste, juice content and method of manufacturing\" from the variant produced in Odisha. And the same goes for the Odisha Rasgulla, which can be claimed as a variant of the Bengali Rasagulla.[62] On 14 November 2017, the GI Registry of India granted West Bengal the GI status for Banglar Rasogolla.[5][63][64] The GI Registrar office at Chennai later specifically clarified that West Bengal was given GI status only for the Bengali version of Rasgulla (\"Banglar Rasogolla\"), not for the sweet's origin. The office also stated that Odisha had not by then applied for any GI tag, but it could also get Odisha Rasgulla's GI tag by presenting the necessary evidence.[5] In 2018 Odisha applied for GI status in Chennai GI Registry.[65] On 29 July 2019, the GI Registry of India granted Odisha the GI status for \"Odisha Rasagola\", which is the Odia version of Rasgulla.[7][8] Hot, cold, or room temperature", "Almond Milk": " Almond milk is a plant-based milk substitute with a watery texture and nutty flavor manufactured from almonds,[1] although some types or brands are flavored in imitation of cow's milk.[2] It does not contain cholesterol or lactose and is low in saturated fat. Almond milk is often consumed by those who are lactose-intolerant and others, such as vegans, who avoid dairy products. Commercial almond milk comes in sweetened, unsweetened, vanilla and chocolate flavors, and is usually fortified with micronutrients. It can also be made at home using a blender, almonds and water.[3][4] Global almond milk sales in 2018 were US$5.8\u00a0billion, growing at 14% per year, and forecast to be a $13\u00a0billion global market by 2025.[5] Almond milk was used as a substitute for animal milk in the Middle Ages in areas that followed Catholic fasting doctrines. Historian Carolyn Walker Bynum notes that: ... Medieval cookbooks suggest that the aristocracy observed fasting strictly, if legalistically. Meat-day and fish-day recipes were not separated in medieval recipe collections, as they were in later, better-organized cookbooks. But the most basic dishes were given in fast-day as well as\nordinary-day versions. For example, a thin split-pea puree, sometimes enriched with fish stock or almond milk (produced by simmering ground almonds in water), replaced meat broth on fast days; and almond milk was a general (and expensive) substitute for cow's milk.[6] Almond milk's popularity as a dairy substitute continued throughout history, going well into modern times. It is even mentioned under the secondary definition of \"milk\" in Samuel Johnson's Dictionary in 1755, alongside pistachio milk.[7] In the United States, almond milk remained a niche health food item until the early 2000s, when its popularity began to increase. In 2011 alone, almond milk sales increased by 79%.[8] In 2013, it surpassed soy milk as the most popular plant-based milk in the US.[9] As of 2014 it comprised 60 percent of plant-milk sales and 4.1 percent of total milk sales in the US.[10]:\u200a2\u20133 Manufacturers and distributors of animal milk have advocated that plant-based milk not be labelled as \"milk\". They complain that consumers may be confused between the two, and that plant-based milks are not necessarily as nutritious in terms of vitamins and minerals. In the United States, as of 2021,  though the USDA is investigating and various state legislatures are considering regulation, various courts have determined that reasonable consumers are not confused, and the FDA has enacted no regulations against plant-based milk labels.[11] European Union regulations require \"milk\" to be used for animals only, except coconut milk. (See Plant milk \u00a7\u00a0Labeling and terminology.) Within the Italian regions of Sicily, Apulia, Calabria, and Campania, almond milk is a protected traditional agricultural product.[12] Brands include Almond Breeze, Elmhurst 1925, Mooala, Silk and Kirkland Signature. Non-human milks are fortified If unfortified, almond milk has less vitamin\u00a0D than fortified cows' milk; in North America, cows' milk must be fortified with vitamin\u00a0D, but vitamins are added to plant milks on a voluntary basis.[18] Vitamin E is released from the almonds and absorbed. The positive effects of the vitamin E includes strengthening the cells.[19] Because of its low protein content, almond milk is not a suitable replacement for breast milk, cows' milk, or hydrolyzed formulas for children under two years of age.[20] The general production method involves soaking and grinding almonds in an excess of water. A milky white liquid is obtained after filtering the almond pulp (flesh). Almond milk can also be made by adding water to almond butter. In commercial production, almond milk is homogenised with high pressure and pasteurised for greater stability and shelf life.[21] Almond milk can be stored in the fridge in an air-tight container (preferably a glass container) for about 4-5 days. However, certain factors, such as the temperature of the refrigerator, sterilization of the blender or storing jar, and surface cleanliness, can decide how many days you can keep it fresh. Storing homemade almond milk for more than a week may reduce its nutrition or even make it unhealthy.[22] In July 2015, a class action lawsuit was filed in New York City against two American manufacturers, Blue Diamond Growers and White Wave Foods, for false advertising regarding the small quantity of almonds (only 2%) contained in the final product.[23][24][25][26] In October 2015, a judge denied the plaintiff's request for an injunction.[27] Almond production in California is concentrated mainly in the Central Valley,[29] where the mild climate, rich soil, and abundant sunshine and water supply make for ideal growing conditions. Due to the persistent droughts in California in the early 21st century, it became more difficult to raise almonds in a sustainable manner.[30][31] Almond sustainability is challenged because of the high amount of water needed to grow almonds: a single glass of almond milk requires roughly 74 litres (16\u00a0imp\u00a0gal; 20\u00a0US\u00a0gal) of water to produce.[28] Among plant-based milks, almond milk requires substantially more water during the growing and production stages than soy, rice or oat milk (graph).[32][28] Dairy milk requires more water to produce than almond milk (graph).[28] In 2014, California produced 42.3\u00a0billion pounds of cow's milk and only 2.14\u00a0billion pounds of almond milk.[33][34] Sustainability strategies implemented by the Almond Board of California and almond farmers include:[31][35][36]", "Masala Chai": " Masala chai (/m\u0259\u02c8s\u0251\u02d0l\u0259 t\u0283a\u026a/; lit.\u2009'mixed-spice tea') is a popular beverage throughout South Asia, originating in India. It is made by brewing black tea (usually crush, tear, curl) in milk and water, and then by sweetening with sugar. Adding aromatic herbs and spices creates masala chai, although chai is often prepared unspiced.[2][3] The term chai originated from the Chinese word for tea, cha (see Etymology of tea) via the Hindi chai (\u091a\u093e\u092f). In English, this spiced tea is commonly referred to as chai tea,[4] or simply chai.[5] Originating in India,[1][6] the beverage has gained worldwide popularity, becoming a feature in many coffee and tea houses, with many using the term chai latte or chai tea latte for their version to indicate that it is made with steamed milk, much like that used to make a caff\u00e8 latte but mixed with a spiced tea concentrate instead of espresso. Tea was introduced to India by the British as a popular beverage. Tea plants have grown wild in the Assam region since antiquity, but historically, Indians viewed tea as a herbal medicine rather than as a recreational beverage.[7] In the 1830s, the British East India Company became concerned about the Chinese monopoly on tea, which constituted most of its trade and supported the enormous consumption of tea in Great Britain around 1 pound (0.45\u00a0kg) per person per year. British colonists had recently noticed the existence of the Assamese tea plants, and began to cultivate tea plantations locally. In 1870, over 90% of the tea consumed in Great Britain was still of Chinese origin, but by 1900, this had dropped to 10%, largely replaced by tea grown in India (50%) and Ceylon (33%).[8] However, consumption of black tea within India remained low until the promotional campaign by the Indian Tea Association in the early 20th century, which encouraged factories, mines, and textile mills to provide tea breaks for their workers. It also supported many independent chaiwalas throughout the growing railway system.[9] Tea was promoted as served Indian style, with small added amounts of milk and sugar. The Indian Tea Association initially disapproved of independent vendors' tendency to add spices and greatly increase the proportions of milk and sugar, thus reducing their usage (and thus purchase) of tea leaves per liquid volume. However, chai later firmly established itself as a popular beverage.[10] Black tea is typically used as base in most chai recipes. The most common type of black tea is Assam; however, a blend of different tea variations may be used.[11] Assam, Darjeeling, and Nilgiri are the three most common types of tea used in chai in India.[12] The spices used in masala chai often include cardamon, ginger, cinnamon, clove, and more. Mint and lemongrass may also be used in masala chai. [13] Masala chai in western India often excludes clove and black peppercorn. A small amount of salt is often added to chai in the region of Bhopal.[14] The Kashmiri version of chai is brewed with green tea instead of black tea and has a more subtle blend of spices with a pinch of salt. This version is a bit savory and is pink in color, due to the addition of baking soda.[15] Traditionally in India, water buffalo milk is used to make chai.[16][17] Although whole milk is usually used in masala chai, alternative dairy milk such as soy milk or skim milk is also a preferred option across the world.[18] White sugar, brown sugar, Demerara sugar, or honey may be used as sweetener in chai. Jaggery may also be used as a sweetener.[19] Masala chai is composed of three major components: masala, chai (or tea), and milk. Recipes and preparation of chai can vary by geography and by family. One way to prep masala chai is by gently boiling water with spices in a pot. Tea is then added to the pot and brewed to preference. Once brewing is complete, the tea and spice mixture is strained into a cup. Milk or cream can then be added.[20] A common Maharashtrian practice for preparation of one cup of chai is to first combine one half cup of water with one-half cup of milk in a pot over heat. Sugar may be added at this point or after. Ginger is then grated into the mixture followed by adding a \"tea masala\". Although the ingredients may vary from region to region, \"tea masala\" typically consists of crushed ginger, crushed cardamom, lemongrass, cloves, and cinnamon.[21] The mixture is brought to a boil and 1 teaspoon of loose black tea[22] is added. Over the last few years, chai has gained popularity for it complex flavors as well as the numerous health benefits consuming chai provides. The blend of black tea leaves with spices such as ginger, cardamom, cinnamon, cloves, and black pepper provides a rich source of antioxidants.[23] Antioxidants help reduce inflammation and support heart health. Ginger and cinnamon, in particular have shown properties that reduce blood pressure and boost immunity. [24]The combination of spices in chai also offers a warming effect which aids overall digestion and improves circulation. Depending on how its is made, it can have less caffeine content than coffee, making it a better alternative for those with caffeine intolerance.[25] Small vendors (called chaiwalla in Hindi/cha-ola in Bengali) are found by the side of every highway, road and alley \u2013 often the only establishments that will be open through the night. They generally also sell tobacco and snacks. Many will deliver tea to people's places of business in a chaidaan, a wooden or metal frame carrier for cups.[26] In the metropolitan city of Mumbai, roadside tea stalls serve smaller cups of tea at a lower budget which is referred to as 'cutting chai', the term 'cutting' referring to the halving of quantity contained in a full cup to reduce the cost of the cup of tea.[27] In Pakistan, masala chai is usually brewed with milk and sweetened with spices like nutmeg, cinnamon and/or cloves.[28] Chai can also be served in a kulhad.[29] Masala chai is popular in East Africa and the Caribbean.[30][31] It is also quite popular in the GCC; but it is locally known as Karak Tea or Chai Karak (Arabic: \u0634\u0627\u064a \u0643\u0631\u0643, Urdu: \u06a9\u0691\u06a9 \u0686\u0627\u0626\u06d2).[32] In the West, to better simulate water buffalo milk, one may try using dry or powdered milk, along with the raw or turbinado sugar normally used in India. In addition, as milk consumption in all age groups in the West has started to decrease steadily over the last 50 years, substitutes such as oat and almond milk have emerged as an alternative to water buffalo milk.[33] As an alternative to the hot tea format, several types of cold \"chai\" beverages have become popular in the United States. These range in complexity from a simple spiced iced tea without milk to a slush of spiced tea, ice, and milk (or nondairy creamer) mixed in a blender and topped with whipped cream.[34] Chai with added espresso is  called a  \"dirty chai\" in America, as well as \"java chai\", \"red eye chai\", \"turbocharger\", \"chai charger\", \"tough guy chai\", etc.[35][36]", "Boiled Rice": "Cooked rice refers to rice that has been cooked either by steaming or boiling. The terms steamed rice or boiled rice are also commonly used. Any variant of Asian rice (both Indica and Japonica varieties), African rice or wild rice, glutinous or non-glutinous, long-, medium-, or short-grain, of any colour, can be used. Rice for cooking can be whole grain or milled. Cooked rice is used as a base for various fried rice dishes (e.g. ch\u01ceof\u00e0n, khao phat), rice bowls/plates (e.g. bibimbap, chazuke, curry rice, dal bhat, donburi, loco moco, panta bhat, rice and beans, rice and gravy), rice porridges (e.g. congee, juk), rice balls/rolls (e.g. gimbap, onigiri, sushi, zongzi), as well as rice cakes and desserts (e.g. mochi, tteok, yaksik). Rice is a staple food in not only Asia and Latin America, but across the globe, and is considered[by whom?] the most consumed food in the world. The U.S. Department of Agriculture classifies rice as part of the grains food group. Nutritionally, 200\u00a0g of cooked steamed white rice contributes 60\u00a0g (2\u00a0oz) toward the daily recommended 170 and 200\u00a0g (6 and 7\u00a0oz) of grains for women and men, respectively, and is considered a good source of micronutrients such as zinc and manganese.[2] Rice is often rinsed and soaked before being cooked. Unpolished brown rice requires longer soaking time than milled white rice does. The amount of water added can vary depending on many factors. In most cases, double water in proportion to rice is added. Newly harvested rice usually requires less water,[3] and softer varieties need more water than firmer varieties. Rice can be boiled in a heavy-bottomed cookware or steamed in a food steamer. Some boiling methods do not require precise water measurements, as the rice is strained after boiling.[4] This draining method is suitable for the less glutinous varieties such as basmati rice, but not-suitable for varieties like japonica rice which become sticky to some degree when cooked. Optionally, a small amount of salt can be added before cooking. If not drained, boiled rice is usually cooked on high heat until a rolling boil, then simmered with the lid on, and steamed over the residual heat after turning off the heat. Nowadays, electric rice cookers are also commonly used to cook rice. During cooking, rice absorbs water and increase in volume and mass. In East Asia, cooked rice is most commonly served in individual bowls, with each diner receiving one. Food from local dishes is placed upon the rice, and is then eaten. Cooked or boiled rice is used as an ingredient in many dishes. Leftover steamed rice is used to make porridge or fried rice dishes. Some common dishes using cooked rice as the main ingredient include: Most common is plain, steamed white rice; however, a number of varieties and are served, many with specific cooking methods. Some varieties include:", "Basmati Rice": "Basmati, pronounced ['b\u0251\u02d0sm\u0259t\u032ai\u02d0], is a variety of long, slender-grained aromatic rice which is traditionally grown in the Indian subcontinent, mainly India, Pakistan, Sri Lanka and Nepal.[2] As of 2019[update], India accounted for 65% of the international trade in basmati rice, while Pakistan accounted for the remaining 35%.[3][4] Many countries use domestically grown basmati rice crops;[5] however, basmati is geographically exclusive to certain districts of India and Pakistan.[6] According to the Indian Agricultural and Processed Food Products Export Development Authority (APEDA), a rice variety is eligible to be called basmati if it has a minimum average precooked milled rice length of 6.61\u00a0mm (0.260\u00a0in) and average precooked milled rice breadth of up to 2\u00a0mm (0.079\u00a0in), among other parameters.[7] According to Oxford English Dictionary, the word basmati derives from Hindi b\u0101smat\u012b, literally, 'fragrant'.[8] Basmati rice is believed to have been cultivated in the Indian subcontinent for centuries. The earliest mention of basmati rice was made in the epic Heer Ranjha composed by the Punjabi poet Waris Shah in 1766.[9][10] India accounts for over 70% of the world's basmati rice production.[11] A small portion of that is being grown organically. Organisations such as Kheti Virasat Mission are trying to increase the amount of organic basmati rice that is being grown in the Punjab in India.[12][13] The areas which have a geographical indication for basmati rice production in India are in the states of Uttarakhand, Bihar,[14] Punjab, Haryana, Himachal Pradesh, Delhi, Western Uttar Pradesh, Odisha and Jammu and Kashmir.[15][unreliable source?] Of these the Uttarakhand varieties from the region of Dehradun are historically rated as the best quality basmati varieties in the world. India's total basmati production for the July 2011 \u2013 June 2012 crop year was five million tonnes.[16] From April 2018 to March 2019, India exported 4.4 million metric tons of basmati rice.[17] In 2015\u20132016, Saudi Arabia, Iran and UAE were the three biggest destinations for India's basmati rice exports and exports to these three countries accounted for more than half of India's total basmati exports.[18] In 2015\u20132016, basmati rice worth US$3.4 billion was exported from India.[18] From 2018-2021 annual exports have surpassed $4 billion USD[19] Dehradun Basmati: Traditional basmati rice variety type 3[20] is a group of various traditional Basmati rice varieties that originated in the present day Dehradun District of Uttarakhand, India. From Dehradun the variety was propagated and grown in other regions of Uttarakhand, most notably in Tapovan, Tehri. The Basmati varieties collectively known as Dehraduni Basmati are significant because of their higher grain quality, unique 'popcorn' aroma and flavour. According to the Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO), Pakistan's original basmatic area lies in the Kalar bowl between the Ravi and Chenab rivers. Almost all the cultivation of basmati takes place in the Punjab province where total production was 2.47\u00a0million metric tons (2,430,000 long tons; 2,720,000 short tons) in 2010.[21][22][23][24] In fiscal year 2020, basmati exports stood at 890,207 tonnes valuing $790 million.[25] In overall basmati exports, Europe holds a 40% share while the rest are exported to Gulf countries, Australia and US.[25] Indonesia produced its own local variant of basmati in West Java and Central Kalimantan, with production capacity estimated to reach up to 8.2 tonnes per hectare.[26] Basmati seeds were first brought from Pakistan in 2007; however, the seeds were unable to be grown due to soil incompatibility. The Ministry of Agriculture then managed to produce and cultivate a hybrid between basmati and local rice in 2017.[27] Basmati rice is produced mainly in the Terai region of Nepal and some parts of Kathmandu valley. Unique Nepali varieties of basmati rice were barred from export to other parts of the world although this ban might be lifted.[28] Small amounts of basmati rice, especially red basmati rice, are being cultivated in the tropical wet zone areas of Sri Lanka.[29][30][31] Basmati rice has a typical pandan-like (Pandanus amaryllifolius leaf) flavour caused by the aroma compound 2-acetyl-1-pyrroline.[32] Basmati grains contain about 0.09 ppm of this aromatic chemical compound naturally, a level that is about 12 times as much as non-basmati rice varieties, giving basmati its distinctive fragrance and flavour.[33] This natural aroma is also found in cheese, fruit and other cereals. It is a flavoring agent approved in the United States and Europe, and is used in bakery products for aroma.[34] During cooking, the level of 2-acetyl-1-pyrroline decreases. Soaking the rice for 30 minutes before cooking permits 20% shorter cooking times and preserves more of the 2-acetyl-1-pyrroline.[35] According to the Canadian Diabetes Association, basmati, brown, wild, short and long grain rice has a medium glycemic index (between 56 and 69), opposed to jasmine and instant white rice with a glycemic index of 89, thus making it more suitable for diabetics as compared to certain other grains and products made from white flour.[36] There are several varieties of basmati rice. Traditional Indian types include basmati 370, basmati 385, and basmati Ranbirsinghpura (R.S.Pura) and Gujjar Chack area in Jammu province situated at the India-Pakistani border in Jammu Kashmir state of India. 1121 and Muradabadi 6465 Extra Long Grain Rice. Pakistani basmati rice varieties are PK 385, Super Kernel Basmati Rice, and D-98. Scientists at Indian Agricultural Research Institute (IARI), Delhi, used conventional plant breeding to produce a hybrid semi-dwarf plant which had most of the good features of traditional basmati (grain elongation, fragrance, alkali content). This hybrid was called Pusa Basmati-1 (PB1; also called \"Todal\", because the flower has awns); crop yield is up to twice as high as traditional varieties. Fragrant rices that are derived from basmati stock but are not true basmati varieties include PB2 (also called sugandh-2), PB3, and RS-10. Dehradun Basmati or traditional basmati rice variety type 3[37] is a group of various Basmati varieties that originated in the present day Dehradun of Uttarakhand, India. From Dehradun the variety was propagated and grown in other regions of Uttarakhand, most notably in Tapovan, Tehri. The Basmati varieties collectively known as Dehradun Basmati are significant because of their higher grain quality, unique 'popcorn' aroma and flavour.[38] The Dehradun Basmati has also been the source of other GMO varieties grown in present day Uttar Pradesh, Punjab and Haryana. Despite not all varieties having received official GI certification Dehradun Basmati varieties consistently rank among the highest rated rice varieties in the world and are distinct for their popcorn like aroma. The popcorn aroma is among some of the special properties Basmati exhibits when grown under the agro-climatic conditions of the Himalayan region. The variety is significant to the farmer identity in state of Uttarakhand, for whom it is among the most profitable crops. Basmati, P3 Punjab, type III Uttar Pradesh, hbc-19 Safidon, 386 Haryana, Kasturi (Baran, Rajasthan), Muradabadi Basmati 6465, Basmati 198, Basmati 217, Basmati 370 Bihar, Kasturi, Mahi Suganda, Pusa 1121, Pusa 1718, Pusa 1509, Pusa 1692, Pusa 1637, Pusa 1401 and 1121 Basmati.[39] Basmati 370 (Pak Basmati), Super Basmati (Best Aroma), Basmati Pak (Kernal), 386 or 1121 basmati rice, Basmati 385, Basmati 515, Basmati 2000, Basmati 198 and Chanab Basmati.[40][41] In Indonesia, the variant of basmati called baroma (basmati aromatik; aromatic basmati) was launched in February 2019.[26] This variant could be grown in low-altitude terrain and managed to attract interest among potential middle-to-upper class consumers.[42] In the United States, a variety of rice based on basmati called Texmati is grown in Texas. The rice is produced by Rice Select,[43] previously owned by RiceTec (mentioned below).[44] In Kenya, a rice variety called Pishori or Pisori is grown in the Mwea region.[45] The word Pishori is an alteration of the word Peshawari from where the basmati variety used to be exported to the countries of East Africa in the past.[46] The Basmati Mark is a DNA-fingerprinting-based certification done by the laboratory of Basmati Export Development Foundation (BEDF).[47] On 15 February 2016, the Agricultural & Processed Food Products Export Development Authority (APEDA), an autonomous organisation under the Department of Commerce in India, registered basmati rice as a product with Geographical Indication (GI).[48] Difficulty in differentiating genuine basmati from other types of rice and the significant price difference between them has led fraudulent traders to adulterate basmati rice with crossbred basmati varieties and long-grain non-basmati varieties. In Britain, the Food Standards Agency found in 2005 that about half of all basmati rice sold was adulterated with other strains of long-grain rice, prompting rice importers to agree to a code of practice.[49] A 2010 UK test on rice supplied by wholesalers found 4 out of 15 samples had cheaper rice mixed with basmati, and one had no basmati at all.[50] A PCR-based assay similar to DNA fingerprinting in humans allows adulterated and non-basmati strains to be detected, with a detection limit from 1% adulteration upwards with an error rate of \u00b11.5%.[51] Exporters of basmati rice use purity certificates based on DNA tests for their basmati rice consignments.[52] Based on this protocol, which was developed at the Centre for DNA Fingerprinting and Diagnostics, the Indian company Lab India has released kits to detect basmati adulteration.[53] In September 1997, an American company, RiceTec, was granted U.S. Patent No. 5,663,484 on \"basmati rice lines and grains\". The patent secures lines of basmati and basmati-like rice and ways of analyzing that rice. RiceTec, owned by Prince Hans-Adam of Liechtenstein, faced international outrage over allegations of biopiracy. It had also caused a brief diplomatic crisis between India and the United States, with India threatening to take the matter to the WTO as a violation of TRIPS, the Agreement on Trade-Related Aspects of Intellectual Property Rights. Both voluntarily and due to review decisions by the United States Patent and Trademark Office, RiceTec lost or withdrew most of the claims of the patent, including, most importantly, the right to call their rice products basmati.[54] A more limited varietal patent was granted to RiceTec in 2001 on claims dealing with three strains of the rice developed by the company.[55][56] ", "Tahiri": "Tahiri may refer to:", "Chicken": " Gallus domesticus L. The chicken (Gallus domesticus) is a large and round short-winged bird, domesticated from the red junglefowl of Southeast Asia around 8,000 years ago. Most chickens are raised for food, providing meat and eggs; others are kept as pets or for cockfighting. Chickens are common and widespread domestic animals, with a total population of 23.7 billion as of 2018[update], and an annual production of more than 50 billion birds. A hen bred for laying can produce over 300 eggs per year. There are numerous cultural references to chickens in folklore, religion, and literature. Terms for chickens include: Chicken can mean a chick, as in William Shakespeare's play Macbeth, where Macduff laments the death of \"all my pretty chickens and their dam\".[15] The usage is preserved in placenames such as the Hen and Chicken Islands.[16] In older sources, and still often in trade and scientific contexts, chickens as a species are described as common fowl or domestic fowl.[17] Chickens are relatively large birds, active by day. The body is round, the legs are unfeathered in most breeds, and the wings are short.[18] Wild junglefowl can fly; chickens and their flight muscles are too heavy to allow them to fly more than a short distance.[19] Size and coloration vary widely between breeds.[18] Adult chickens of both sexes have a fleshy crest on their heads called a comb or cockscomb, and hanging flaps of skin on either side under their beaks called wattles; combs and wattles are more prominent in males. Some breeds have a mutation that causes extra feathering under the face, giving the appearance of a beard.[20] Chickens are omnivores.[21] In the wild, they scratch at the soil to search for seeds, insects, and animals as large as lizards, small snakes,[22] and young mice.[23] A chicken may live for 5\u201310 years, depending on the breed.[24] The world's oldest known chicken lived for 16 years.[25] Chickens are gregarious, living in flocks, and incubate eggs and raise young communally. Individual chickens dominate others, establishing a pecking order; dominant individuals take priority for access to food and nest sites. The concept of dominance, involving pecking, was described in female chickens by Thorleif Schjelderup-Ebbe in 1921 as the \"pecking order\".[26][27] Male chickens tend to leap and use their claws in conflicts.[28] Chickens are capable of mobbing and killing a weak or inexperienced predator, such as a young fox.[29] A male's crowing is a loud and sometimes shrill call, serving as a territorial signal to other males,[30] and in response to sudden disturbances within their surroundings. Hens cluck loudly after laying an egg and to call their chicks. Chickens give different warning calls to indicate that a predator is approaching from the air or on the ground.[31] To initiate courting, some roosters may dance in a circle around or near a hen (a circle dance), often lowering the wing which is closest to the hen.[32] The dance triggers a response in the hen[32] and when she responds to his call, the rooster may mount the hen and proceed with the mating. Mating typically involves a sequence in which the male approaches the female and performs a waltzing display. If the female is unreceptive, she runs off; otherwise, she crouches, and the male mounts, treading with both feet on her back. After copulation the male does a tail-bending display.[33] Sperm transfer occurs by cloacal contact between the male and female, in an action called the 'cloacal kiss'.[34] As with all birds, reproduction is controlled by a neuroendocrine system, the Gonadotropin-Releasing Hormone-I neurons in the hypothalamus. Reproductive hormones including estrogen, progesterone, and gonadotropins (luteinizing hormone and follicle-stimulating hormone) initiate and maintain sexual maturation changes. Reproduction declines with age, thought to be due to a decline in GnRH-I-N.[35] Hens often try to lay in nests that already contain eggs and sometimes move eggs from neighbouring nests into their own. A flock thus uses only a few preferred locations, rather than having a different nest for every bird.[36] Under natural conditions, most birds lay only until a clutch is complete; they then incubate all the eggs. This is called \"going broody\". The hen sits on the nest, fluffing up or pecking defensively if disturbed. She rarely leaves the nest until the eggs have hatched.[37] Eggs of chickens from the high-altitude region of Tibet have special physiological adaptations that result in a higher hatching rate in low oxygen environments. When eggs are placed in a hypoxic environment, chicken embryos from these populations express much more hemoglobin than embryos from other chicken populations. This hemoglobin has a greater affinity for oxygen, binding oxygen more readily.[38] Fertile chicken eggs hatch at the end of the incubation period, about 21 days; the chick uses its egg tooth to break out of the shell.[32] Hens remain on the nest for about two days after the first chick hatches; during this time the newly hatched chicks feed by absorbing the internal yolk sac.[39] The hen guards her chicks and brood them to keep them warm. She leads them to food and water and calls them towards food. The chicks imprint on the hen and subsequently follow her continually. She continues to care for them until they are several weeks old.[40] Inbreeding of White Leghorn chickens tends to cause inbreeding depression expressed as reduced egg number and delayed sexual maturity.[41] Strongly inbred Langshan chickens display obvious inbreeding depression in reproduction, particularly for traits such as age when the first egg is laid and egg number.[42] Water or ground-dwelling fowl similar to modern partridges, in the Galliformes, the order of bird that chickens belong to, survived the Cretaceous\u2013Paleogene extinction event that killed all tree-dwelling birds and their dinosaur relatives.[43] Chickens are descended primarily from the red junglefowl (Gallus gallus) and are scientifically classified as the same species.[44] Domesticated chickens freely interbreed with populations of red junglefowl.[44] The domestic chicken has subsequently hybridised with grey junglefowl, Sri Lankan junglefowl and green junglefowl;[45] a gene for yellow skin, for instance, was incorporated into domestic birds from the grey junglefowl (G. sonneratii).[46] It is estimated that chickens share between 71 and 79% of their genome with red junglefowl.[45] According to one early study, a single domestication event of the red junglefowl in present-day Thailand gave rise to the modern chicken with minor transitions separating the modern breeds.[49] The red junglefowl is well adapted to take advantage of the vast quantities of seed produced during the end of the multi-decade bamboo seeding cycle, to boost its own reproduction.[50] In domesticating the chicken, humans took advantage of the red junglefowl's ability to reproduce prolifically when exposed to a surge in its food supply.[51] Exactly when and where the chicken was domesticated remains controversial. Genomic studies estimate that the chicken was domesticated 8,000 years ago[45] in Southeast Asia and spread to China and India 2,000 to 3,000 years later. Archaeological evidence supports domestic chickens in Southeast Asia well before 6000\u00a0BC, China by 6000\u00a0BC and India by 2000\u00a0BC.[45][52][53] A landmark 2020 Nature study that fully sequenced 863 chickens across the world suggests that all domestic chickens originate from a single domestication event of red junglefowl whose present-day distribution is predominantly in southwestern China, northern Thailand and Myanmar. These domesticated chickens spread across Southeast and South Asia where they interbred with local wild species of junglefowl, forming genetically and geographically distinct groups. Analysis of the most popular commercial breed shows that the White Leghorn breed possesses a mosaic of divergent ancestries inherited from subspecies of red junglefowl.[54][55][56] A word for the domestic chicken (*manuk) is part of the reconstructed Proto-Austronesian language, indicating they were domesticated by the Austronesian peoples since ancient times. Chickens, together with dogs and pigs, were carried throughout the entire range of the prehistoric Austronesian maritime migrations to Island Southeast Asia, Micronesia, Island Melanesia, Polynesia, and Madagascar, starting from at least 3000\u00a0BC from Taiwan.[57][58][59][60] These chickens might have been introduced during pre-Columbian times to South America via Polynesian seafarers, but evidence for this is still putative.[61] The possibility that domestic chickens were in the Americas before Western contact is debated by researchers, but blue-egged chickens, found only in the Americas and Asia, suggest an Asian origin for early American chickens. A lack of data from Thailand, Russia, the Indian subcontinent, Southeast Asia and Sub-Saharan Africa makes it difficult to lay out a clear map of the spread of chickens in these areas; better description and genetic analysis of local breeds threatened by extinction may also help with research into this area.[62] Chicken bones from the Arauco Peninsula in south-central Chile were radiocarbon dated as pre-Columbian, and DNA analysis suggested they were related to prehistoric populations in Polynesia.[47][48] However, further study of the same bones cast doubt on the findings.[63][64] Chicken remains have been difficult to date, given the small and fragile bird bones; this may account for discrepancies in dates given by different sources. Archaeological evidence is supplemented by mentions in historical texts from the last few centuries BC, and by depictions in prehistoric artworks, such as across Central Asia.[65] Chickens were widespread throughout southern Central Asia by the 4th century BC.[65] Middle Eastern chicken remains go back to a little earlier than 2000\u00a0BC in Syria.[62] Phoenicians spread chickens along the Mediterranean coasts as far as Iberia. During the Hellenistic period (4th\u20132nd centuries BC), in the southern Levant, chickens began to be widely domesticated for food.[66] The first pictures of chickens in Europe are found on Corinthian pottery of the 7th century BC.[67][68] Breeding increased under the Roman Empire and reduced in the Middle Ages.[62] Genetic sequencing of chicken bones from archaeological sites in Europe revealed that in the High Middle Ages chickens became less aggressive and began to lay eggs earlier in the breeding season.[69] Chickens reached Egypt via the Middle East for purposes of cockfighting about 1400\u00a0BC and became widely bred in Egypt around 300\u00a0BC.[62] Three possible routes of introduction into Africa around the early first millennium AD could have been through the Egyptian Nile Valley, the East Africa Roman-Greek or Indian trade, or from Carthage and the Berbers, across the Sahara. The earliest known remains are from Mali, Nubia, East Coast, and South Africa and date back to the middle of the first millennium AD.[62] Chickens are susceptible both to parasites such as mites, and to diseases caused by pathogens such as bacteria and viruses. The parasite Dermanyssus gallinae feeds on blood, causing irritation and reducing egg production, and acts as a vector for bacterial diseases such as salmonellosis and spirochaetosis.[70]\nViral diseases include avian influenza.[71] Chickens are common and widespread domestic animals, with a total population of 23.7 billion as of 2018[update].[72] More than 50 billion chickens are reared annually as a source of meat and eggs.[73] In the United States alone, more than 8 billion chickens are slaughtered each year for meat,[74] and more than 300 million chickens are reared for egg production.[75] The vast majority of poultry is raised in factory farms. According to the Worldwatch Institute, 74% of the world's poultry meat and 68% of eggs are produced this way.[76] An alternative to intensive poultry farming is free-range farming. Friction between these two main methods has led to long-term issues of ethical consumerism. Opponents of intensive farming argue that it harms the environment, creates human health risks and is inhumane.[77] Advocates of intensive farming say that their efficient systems save land and food resources owing to increased productivity, and that the animals are looked after in a controlled environment.[78] Chickens farmed for meat are called broilers. Broiler breeds typically take less than six weeks to reach slaughter size,[79] some weeks longer for free range and organic broilers.[80] Chickens farmed primarily for eggs are called layer hens. The UK alone consumes more than 34 million eggs per day.[81] Hens of some breeds can produce over 300 eggs per year; the highest authenticated rate of egg laying is 371 eggs in 364 days.[82] After 12 months of laying, the commercial hen's egg-laying ability declines to the point where the flock is commercially unviable. Hens, particularly from battery cage systems, are sometimes infirm or have lost a significant amount of their feathers, and their life expectancy has been reduced from around seven years to less than two years.[83] In the UK and Europe, laying hens are then slaughtered and used in processed foods, or sold as 'soup hens'.[83] In some other countries, flocks are sometimes force moulted rather than being slaughtered to re-invigorate egg-laying. This involves complete withdrawal of food (and sometimes water) for 7\u201314 days[84] or sufficiently long to cause a body weight loss of 25 to 35%,[85] or up to 28 days under experimental conditions.[86] This stimulates the hen to lose her feathers but also re-invigorates egg-production. Some flocks may be force-moulted several times. In 2003, more than 75% of all flocks were moulted in the US.[87] Keeping chickens as pets became increasingly popular in the 2000s[88] among urban and suburban residents.[89] Many people obtain chickens for their egg production but often name them and treat them as any other pet like cats or dogs. Chickens provide companionship and have individual personalities. While many do not cuddle much, they will eat from one's hand, jump onto one's lap, respond to and follow their handlers, as well as show affection.[90][91] Chickens are social, inquisitive, intelligent[92] birds, and many people find their behaviour entertaining.[93] Certain breeds, such as silkies and many bantam varieties, are generally docile and are often recommended as good pets around children with disabilities.[94] A cockfight is a contest held in a ring called a cockpit between two cocks. Cockfighting is outlawed in many countries as involving cruelty to animals.[95] The activity seems to have been practised in the Indus Valley civilisation from 2500 to 2100 BC.[96] In the process of domestication, chickens were apparently kept initially for cockfighting, and only later used for food.[97] Chickens have long been used as model organisms to study developing embryos. Large numbers of embryos can be provided commercially; fertilized eggs can easily be opened and used to observe the developing embryo. Equally important, embryologists can carry out experiments on such embryos, close the egg again and study the effects later in development. For instance, many important discoveries in limb development have been made using chicken embryos, such as the discovery of the apical ectodermal ridge and the zone of polarizing activity.[98] The chicken was the first bird species to have its genome sequenced.[99] At 1.21 Gb, the chicken genome is similarly sized compared to other birds, but smaller than nearly all mammals: the human genome is 3.2 Gb.[100] The final gene set contained 26,640 genes (including noncoding genes and pseudogenes), with a total of 19,119 protein-coding genes, a similar number to the human genome.[101] In 2006, scientists researching the ancestry of birds switched on a chicken recessive gene, talpid2, and found that the embryo jaws initiated formation of teeth, like those found in ancient bird fossils.[102]  Chickens feature widely in folklore, religion, literature, and popular culture. The chicken is a sacred animal in many cultures and deeply embedded in belief systems and religious practices.[103]\nRoosters are sometimes used for divination, a practice called alectryomancy. This involves the sacrifice of a sacred rooster, often during a ritual cockfight, used as a form of communication with the gods.[104] In Gabriel Garc\u00eda M\u00e1rquez's Nobel-Prize-winning 1967 novel One Hundred Years Of Solitude, cockfighting is outlawed in the town of Macondo after the patriarch of the Buendia family murders his cockfighting rival and is haunted by the man's ghost.[105] Chicken jokes have been made at least since The Knickerbocker published one in 1847.[106] Chickens have featured in art in farmyard scenes such as Adriaen van Utrecht's 1646 Turkeys and Chickens and Walter Osborne's 1885 Feeding the Chickens.[107] The nursery rhyme \"Cock a doodle doo\", its chorus line imitating the cockerel's call, was published in Mother Goose's Melody in 1765.[108] \nThe 2000 animated adventure comedy film Chicken Run, directed by Peter Lord and Nick Park, featured anthropomorphic chickens with many chicken jokes.[109][110][111]", "Fish Curry": " Maacher Jhol - The fish curry is a 2D animated short film directed by Abhishek Verma.[1][2][3][4][5] It follows a son coming out to his father, while he prepares his favourite dish, maacher jhol, a traditional fish recipe in Bengal.

It is a subspecies of the cowpea, an Old World plant domesticated in Africa, and is sometimes simply called a cowpea. The common commercial variety is called the California Blackeye; it is pale-colored with a prominent black spot. The American South has countless varieties, many of them heirloom, that vary in size from the small lady peas to very large ones. The color of the eye may be black, brown, red, pink, or green. All the peas are green when freshly shelled and brown or buff when dried. A popular variation[3][4] of the black-eyed pea is the purple hull pea or mud-in-your-eye pea; it is usually green with a prominent purple or pink spot. The currently accepted botanical name for the black-eyed pea is Vigna unguiculata subsp. unguiculata,[5] although previously it was classified in the genus Phaseolus. Vigna unguiculata subsp. dekindtiana is the wild relative and Vigna unguiculata subsp. sesquipedalis is the related asparagus bean. Other beans of somewhat similar appearance, such as the frijol ojo de cabra (goat's-eye bean) of northern Mexico, are sometimes incorrectly called black-eyed peas, and vice versa. The Black-eyed pea originates from West Africa and has been cultivated in China and India since prehistoric times.[6] It was grown[7] in Virginia since the 17th century by African slaves[8] who were brought to America along with the indigenous plants from their homelands.[9] The crop would also eventually [10] prove popular in Texas. The planting of crops of black-eyed peas was promoted by George Washington Carver because, as a legume, it adds nitrogen to the soil and has high nutritional value. Throughout the South, the black-eyed pea is still a widely used ingredient today[11] in soul food and cuisines of the Southern United States.[12] The black-eye pea is cultivated throughout the world.[1] In non-tropical climates, this heat-loving crop should be sown after all danger of frost has passed and the soil is warm. Seeds sown too early will rot before germination. Black-eyed peas are extremely drought tolerant, so excessive watering should be avoided.[13] The crop is relatively free of pests and disease. Root-knot nematodes can be a problem, especially if crops are not rotated. As a nitrogen-fixing legume, fertilization can exclude nitrogen three weeks after germination. The blossom produces nectar plentifully, and large areas can be a source of honey. Because the bloom attracts a variety of pollinators, care must be taken in the application of insecticides to avoid label violations. After planting the pea, it should start to grow after 2\u20135 days. In the Southern United States, eating black-eyed peas or Hoppin' John (a traditional soul food) on New Year's Day is thought to bring prosperity in the new year.[14] The peas are typically cooked with a pork product for flavoring (such as bacon, fatback, ham bones, or hog jowls) and diced onion, and served with a hot chili sauce or a pepper-flavored vinegar. The traditional meal also includes cabbage, collard, turnip, or mustard greens, and ham. The peas, since they swell when cooked, symbolize prosperity; the greens symbolize money; the pork, because pigs root forward when foraging, represents positive motion.[15] Cornbread, which represents gold, also often accompanies this meal.[16] Several legends exist as to the origin of this custom. Two popular explanations for the South's association with peas and good luck date back to the American Civil War. The first is associated with General William T. Sherman's march of the Union Army to the sea, during which they pillaged the Confederates' food supplies. Stories say peas and salted pork were said to have been left untouched, because of the belief that they were animal food unfit for human consumption. Southerners considered themselves lucky to be left with some supplies to help them survive the winter, and black-eyed peas evolved into a representation of good luck. One challenge to this legend is that General Sherman brought backup supplies with him including three days of animal feed[17] and would have been unlikely to have left even animal feed untouched. In addition, the dates of the first average frost for Atlanta and Savannah, respectively, are November 13 and November 28.[18] As Sherman's march was from November 15 to December 21, 1864, it is improbable, although possible, that the Union Army would have come across standing fields of black-eyed peas as relayed in most versions of the legend. In another Southern tradition, black-eyed peas were a symbol of emancipation for African-Americans who had previously been enslaved, and who after the Civil War were officially freed on New Year's Day.[19][20] Other Southern American traditions point to Jews of Ashkenazi and Sephardic ancestry in Southern cities and plantations eating the peas.[21] In Egypt, black-eyed peas are called lobia.[22] When cooked with onions, garlic, meat and tomato juice, and served with Egyptian rice with some pastina called shaerya mixed in, they make the most famous rice dish in Egypt. In Jordan, Lebanon, and Syria, lobya or green black-eyed beans are cooked with onion, garlic, tomatoes, peeled and chopped, olive oil, salt and black pepper. In Nigeria and Ghana within West Africa and the Caribbean, a traditional dish called akara or koose comprises mashed black-eyed peas with added salt, onions and/or peppers. The mixture is then fried. In Nigeria a pudding called 'moin-moin' is made from ground and mixed peas with seasoning as well as some plant proteins before it is steamed. This is served with various carbohydrate-rich foods such as pap, rice or garri.[23] In Indonesia, black-eyed peas are called kacang tunggak\u00a0[id] or kacang tolo in the local language. They are commonly used in curry dishes such as sambal goreng, a hot and spicy red curry dish, sayur brongkos, or sayur lodeh. The bean is commonly used across India. In the Hindi dialects of North India, black-eyed peas are called lobia (\u0932\u094b\u092c\u0940\u092f\u093e) / rongi (\u0930\u094b\u0902\u0917\u0940) and are cooked like daal , and served with boiled rice.[24] In Nepali- speaking areas of India and Nepal, it is called lobia (Nepali- \u0932\u094b\u092c\u0940\u092f\u093e, Bodi, \u092c\u094b\u0921\u0940). In Punjabi-speaking areas of both India and Pakistan, they are called rongi/lobia (Punjabi-\u0a30\u0a4c\u0a01\u0a17\u0a40/\u0a32\u0a4b\u0a2c\u0a40\u0a06). In Gujarat, they are called suki choli/choli (Gujarati- \u0ab8\u0ac1\u0a95\u0ac0 \u0a9a\u0acb\u0ab3\u0ac0/\u0a9a\u0acb\u0ab3\u0ac0). In Bengali speaking parts of India (West Bengal) and Bangladesh, they are known as borboti kolai  (Bengali-\u09ac\u09b0\u09ac\u099f\u09bf \u0995\u09b2\u09be\u0987). In Odisha, they are called jhudanga/jhunga (Odia- \u0b1d\u0b41\u0b21\u0b3c\u0b19\u0b4d\u0b17/\u0b1d\u0b41\u0b19\u0b4d\u0b17). In Assam, they are called lesera maah (Assamese- \u09b2\u09c7\u099a\u09f0\u09be \u09ae\u09be\u09b9). In Goa and other Konkani speaking areas of India, lobia/black eyed beans are called bogdo /chawli (Konkani- \u092c\u094b\u0917\u094d\u0921\u094b/\u091a\u0935\u0933\u0940). In Maharashtra, they are called chawli (Marathi- \u091a\u0935\u0933\u0940) and made into a curry called chawli amti or chawli usal.[25] In Karnataka, they are called alsande kalu (Kannada- \u0c85\u0cb2\u0cb8\u0c82\u0ca6\u0cc6 \u0c95\u0cbe\u0cb3\u0cc1) and used in the preparation of huli, a popular type of curry.[26] In the coastal areas of southern Karnataka like South Kanara district, they are called as lathanay bitt in Tulu language (Tulu- \u0cb2\u0ca4\u0ccd\u0ca4\u0ca3\u0cc6 \u0cac\u0cbf\u0ca4\u0ccd\u0ca4) and are cooked in spiced coconut paste to make a saucy curry or a dry coconut curry. In Tamil Nadu, they are called karamani/thattapayaru (Tamil- \u0b95\u0bbe\u0bb0\u0bae\u0ba3\u0bbf/\u0ba4\u0b9f\u0bcd\u0b9f\u0baa\u0bcd\u0baa\u0baf\u0bbf\u0bb1\u0bc1) and used in various recipes, including being boiled and made into a salad-like sundal (often during the Ganesh Chaturthi and Navratri festivals).[27] In Andhra Pradesh and Telangana, they are known by the name bobbarlu/alasandalu kura (Telugu- \u0c2c\u0c4a\u0c2c\u0c4d\u0c2c\u0c30\u0c4d\u0c32\u0c41/\u0c05\u0c32\u0c38\u0c02\u0c26\u0c32\u0c41 \u0c15\u0c42\u0c30), and are used for variety of recipes, most popularly for Vada. In Kerala, they are called vellapayar (Malayalam-\u0d35\u0d46\u0d33\u0d33\u0d2a\u0d2f\u0d7c) and is a part of the Sadhya dish, Olan. In Vietnam, black-eyed peas are used in a sweet dessert called ch\u00e8 \u0111\u1eadu tr\u1eafng (black-eyed peas and sticky rice with coconut milk). In Cyprus (\u03c6\u03c1\u03ad\u03c3\u03ba\u03bf \u03bb\u03bf\u03c5\u03b2\u03af (fresko luvi)), Greece (\u03bc\u03b1\u03c5\u03c1\u03bf\u03bc\u03ac\u03c4\u03b9\u03ba\u03b1) and Turkey (b\u00f6r\u00fclce salatas\u0131), blanched black-eyed peas are eaten as salad with a dressing of olive oil, salt, lemon juice, onions and garlic.[28] In Portugal, black-eyed peas are served with boiled cod and potatoes, with tuna, and in salads. \"Hoppin' John\", made of black-eyed peas or field peas, rice, and pork, is a traditional dish in parts of the Southern United States. Texas caviar, another traditional dish in the American South, is made from black-eyed peas marinated in vinaigrette-style dressing and chopped garlic.[29] In Brazil's northeastern state of Bahia, especially in the city of Salvador, black-eyed peas (named \"feij\u00e3o fradinho\" there) are used in a traditional street food of West African cuisine origin called acaraj\u00e9. The beans are peeled and mashed, and the resulting paste is made into balls and deep-fried in dend\u00ea. Acaraj\u00e9 is typically served split in half and stuffed with vatap\u00e1, caruru, diced green and red tomatoes, fried sun-dried shrimp and homemade hot sauce. In the northern part of Colombia, they are used to prepare a fritter called bu\u00f1uelo. The beans are immersed in water for a few hours to loosen their skins and soften them. The skins are then removed either by hand or with the help of a manual grinder. Once the skins are removed, the bean is ground or blended, and eggs are added, which produces a soft mix. The mix is fried in hot oil. It makes a nutritious breakfast meal. In Guyana, South America, and Trinidad and Tobago, it is one of the most popular type of beans cooked with rice, the main one being red kidney beans, also referred to as red beans. It is also cooked as a snack or appetizer on its own. On New Year's Eve (referred to as Old Year's Night in Guyana and Suriname), families cook a traditional dish called cook-up rice. The dish comprises rice, black-eyed peas, and other peas and a variety of meats cooked in coconut milk and seasonings. According to tradition, cook-up rice should be the first thing consumed in the New Year for good luck. Cook-up rice is also made as an everyday dish. One 100\u00a0g serving of cooked black-eyed peas contains 484 kilojoules (116 kilocalories) of food energy and is an excellent source of folate and a good source of thiamine, iron, magnesium, manganese, phosphorus, and zinc.[32] The legume is also a good source of dietary fiber (6.5\u00a0g per 100\u00a0g serving) and contains a moderate amount of numerous other vitamins and minerals (table).", "Doner Kebab": " Doner kebab (UK: /\u02c8d\u0252n\u0259r k\u026a\u02c8b\u00e6b/, US: /\u02c8do\u028an\u0259r k\u026a\u02c8b\u0251\u02d0b/; Turkish: d\u00f6ner or d\u00f6ner kebap, pronounced [d\u0153\u02c8n\u00e6\u027e ke\u02c8b\u0251p]), also spelled as d\u00f6ner kebab, is a dish of Turkish origin made of meat cooked on a vertical rotisserie.[1] Seasoned meat stacked in the shape of an inverted cone is turned slowly on the rotisserie, next to a vertical cooking element. The operator uses a knife to slice thin shavings from the outer layer of the meat as it cooks. The vertical rotisserie was invented in the 19th-century Ottoman Empire, and dishes such as the Arab shawarma, Greek gyros, Canadian donair, and Mexican al pastor are derived from this.[2][3][4] The modern sandwich variant of d\u00f6ner kebab originated and was popularized in 1970s West Berlin by Turkish immigrants.[5][6][7] This was recognized by the Berlin-based Association of Turkish Doner Manufacturers in Europe in 2011.[8] The sliced meat of a doner kebab may be served on a plate with various accompaniments, stuffed into a pita or other type of bread as a sandwich, or wrapped in a thin flatbread such as lavash or filo, known as a d\u00fcr\u00fcm (literally meaning roll or wrap in Turkish). Kadir Nurman in the early 1970s introduced the sandwich or wrap form, which has become popular around the world as a fast food dish sold by kebab shops, and is often called simply a \"kebab\".[9] The sandwich generally contains salad or vegetables, which may include tomato, lettuce, cabbage, onion with sumac, fresh or pickled cucumber, or chili, and various types of sauces.[10][11] In the Ottoman Empire, at least as far back as the 17th century, stacks of seasoned sliced meat were cooked on a horizontal rotisserie, similar to the ca\u011f kebab.[12] The vertical rotisserie was introduced no later than the mid-19th century.[12][2][13] The town of Bursa, in modern-day Turkey, is often considered the birthplace of the vertically roasted d\u00f6ner kebab.[14] According to Yavuz \u0130skendero\u011flu, his grandfather \u0130skender Efendi as a child in 1850s Bursa had the idea of roasting the lamb at his father's restaurant vertically rather than horizontally; it was a success, and some years later became known as d\u00f6ner kebap.[15] [non-primary source needed] However, he may have been preceded by Hamdi Usta from Kastamonu around 1830.[16][17][18] A version popular in the Arab world became known as shawarma. By at least the 1930s it had been brought overseas, and was sold in restaurants in Mexico by Lebanese immigrants.[3] Doner kebab likely arrived in Greece in the 1920s with the population exchange between Greece and Turkey, later transforming into gyros.[19] It was not until a century after its invention that d\u00f6ner kebab was introduced and popularized in Istanbul, most famously by Beyti G\u00fcler. His restaurant, first opened in 1945, was soon discovered by journalists and began serving d\u00f6ner and other kebab dishes to kings, prime ministers, film stars and celebrities.[20] It has been sold in sandwich form in Istanbul since at least the mid-1960s.[18] The d\u00f6ner kebab and its derivatives served in a sandwich form as \"fast food\" came to worldwide prominence in the mid to late 20th century. The first doner kebab shop in London opened in 1966[21] and they were a familiar sight in provincial cities by the late 1970s, while gyros was already popular in Greece and New York City in 1971.[22][23] A Greek-Canadian variation, the donair, was introduced in 1972, eventually becoming the official food of Halifax, and spreading across the country.[24][25] By the 1960s, the taco al pastor in Mexico had evolved from the shawarma.[3] In Germany, the d\u00f6ner kebab was popularized by Turkish guest workers in Berlin in the early 1970s.[26] The dish developed there from its original form into a distinctive style of sandwich with abundant salad, vegetables, and sauces, sold in large portions at affordable prices, that would soon become one of the top-selling fast food and street food dishes in Germany and much of Europe, and popular around the world.[27] In the English name \"doner kebab\", the word doner is borrowed from the Turkish d\u00f6ner kebap, with the Turkish letter \u00f6 usually anglicized as \"o\",[28] though \"d\u00f6ner kebab\" is an alternative spelling in English.[29] The word \"kebab\" is used, which comes to English from the Arabic: \u0643\u064e\u0628\u064e\u0627\u0628 (kab\u0101b), partly through Urdu, Persian and Turkish; it may refer to a number of different kebab dishes made with roasted or grilled meat. While kebab has been used in English since the late 17th century, doner/d\u00f6ner kebab is known only from the mid-20th or later.[29] The Turkish word d\u00f6ner comes from d\u00f6nmek (\"to turn\" or \"to rotate\"), so the Turkish name d\u00f6ner kebap literally means \"rotating roast\".[30] In German, it is spelled D\u00f6ner Kebab; the sandwich is often called ein D\u00f6ner. Particularly in British English, a d\u00f6ner kebab sandwich may be referred to simply as \"a kebab\".[31] A Canadian variation is \"donair\". In Greek, it was originally called d\u00f6ner (Greek: \u03bd\u03c4\u03bf\u03bd\u03ad\u03c1) but later came to be known as gyros, from \u03b3\u03cd\u03c1\u03bf\u03c2 (\"turn\"), a calque of the Turkish name.[32] The Arabic name \u0634\u0627\u0648\u0631\u0645\u0627 (sh\u0101warm\u0101) derives from another Turkish word, \u00e7evirme, also meaning \"turning\". Persians refer to it as \"kebab torki\".[33] There are many variations of d\u00f6ner in Turkey: In Azerbaijan, d\u00f6ner kebab (Azerbaijani: d\u00f6n\u0259r), served similarly to the European style of sandwich wrapped in lava\u015f (flatbread) or in \u00e7\u00f6r\u04d9k (bread, including tandoor bread), is one of the most widespread fast foods. It is usually made with \u04d9t (meat, essentially lamb or mutton), but sometimes toyuq (chicken).[39][40][41] In Japan, d\u00f6ner kebabs are now common, especially in Tokyo. They are predominantly made of chicken but occasionally beef, and called simply \"kebab\". The toppings include shredded lettuce or cabbage, sliced tomato, and usually a choice of sauces such as Thousand Islands, spicy, and garlic.[42] D\u00f6ner kebab is increasingly becoming popular in Vietnam, mostly because of Vietnamese who used to live in Germany and introduced it to their homeland. Throughout Hanoi and Ho Chi Minh City many d\u00f6ner kebab stalls can be found. B\u00e1nh m\u1ef3 D\u00f6ner Kebab, the Vietnamese version of the d\u00f6ner kebab, has some fundamental differences with the original d\u00f6ner kebab. First of all, pork is used instead of beef and lamb. Second, the meat is topped with sour vegetables and chili sauce.[43][44] D\u00f6ner kebab shops can be found in all cities across Austria. Kebabs (often referred to as \"D\u00f6ner\") outsell burgers or the traditional W\u00fcrstel (sausage).[45] In Belgium, the first d\u00f6ner kebabs were already served in the 1970s, brought by immigrants to the country. In the mining region, mainly beef or variants with pieces of chicken was used for the D\u00f6ner kebab. D\u00f6ner kebabs with mutton and lamb were more likely to be found in other regions of Belgium.[citation needed] In Finland, d\u00f6ner kebabs gained popularity after the 90s, when Turkish and other Middle-Eastern immigrants started to arrive in the country in considerable numbers, opening restaurants and importing their traditional dishes. Kebabs are generally seen as fast food, often served by late-night pizzerias.[46] Turkish immigrants also brought doner kebab to France, where it became especially popular with the country's large North African population, in the 1980s.[47] A typical kebab consists of bread stuffed with d\u00f6ner meat shavings, lettuce, sliced tomato and onions, with a choice of sauce including sauce blanche, a mayo-yogurt sauce. Kebabs are usually served with french fries, often stuffed into the bread itself. In Paris, this variation is called Sandwich grec (\"Greek sandwich\").[48][49] Doner kebab is the third most popular fast food in France, next to hamburgers and pizza, with more than 10,000 kebab shops selling about 300 million a year.[47] In Germany, the earliest claim to the introduction of Turkish d\u00f6ner kebab dates to 1969, when Bursa native Nevzat Salim and his father started to sell Iskender Kebap in Reutlingen.[50] However, the Association of Turkish D\u00f6ner Producers in Europe (ATDID) connects the wide popularization of the dish to the stand of Turkish guest worker Kadir Nurman at West Berlin's Zoo Station in 1972, which helped establish the d\u00f6ner kebab sandwich as a fast food option.[50][26] While the claims of multiple persons to have \"invented\" the d\u00f6ner may be hard to prove,[51] the further development of modern d\u00f6ner sandwich is connected to the city of Berlin.[52] The d\u00f6ner kebap as it was first served in Berlin contained only meat, onions and a bit of salad.[53] Over time, it developed into a dish with abundant salad, vegetables, and a selection of sauces to choose from. Even orders placed in the Turkish language in Berlin will ask for the hot sauce using the German word \"scharf\", flagging the hybrid nature of the Berlin style of d\u00f6ner kebap.[54]:\u200a58\u200a This variation served with pita bread has influenced the style of d\u00f6ner kebap in Germany and in other nations. A 2007 survey showed that many people consider the d\u00f6ner kebab to be the most characteristic food of Berlin.[54]:\u200a54 Annual sales of d\u00f6ner kebabs in Germany amounted to \u20ac2.5\u00a0billion in 2010.[55] Beef or veal, and chicken, are widely used instead of the more expensive lamb. Turkey (Truthahn) and vegetarian versions have become increasingly popular.[56] Tarkan Ta\u015fyumruk, president of the Association of Turkish D\u00f6ner Producers in Europe (ATDID), provided information in 2010 that, every day, more than 400 tonnes of d\u00f6ner kebab meat is produced in Germany by around 350 firms. At the same ATDID fair, Ta\u015fyumruk stated that, \"Annual sales in Germany amount to \u20ac2.5\u00a0billion. That shows we are one of the biggest fast-foods in Germany.\" In many cities throughout Germany, d\u00f6ner kebabs are at least as popular as hamburgers or sausages, especially with young people.[55] In 2011 there were over 16,000 establishments selling d\u00f6ner kebabs in Germany, with yearly sales of \u20ac3.5\u00a0billion.[57] Kapsalon is a Dutch food item consisting of French fries topped with d\u00f6ner or shawarma meat, garlic sauce, and a layer of Gouda cheese, baked or broiled until melted, and then subsequently covered with a layer of dressed salad greens and more sauce. The dish is usually served as fast food in a disposable metal tray. The term kapsalon means \"hairdressing salon\" or \"barbershop\" in Dutch, alluding to hairdresser Nathaniel Gomes who originated the dish when he requested his local kebab shop in Rotterdam to prepare it for him.[58] Introduced by Turkish immigrants, the d\u00f6ner kebab with salad and sauce is a very popular dish in the United Kingdom, especially after a night out.[51] The meat is sometimes sold on its own, but more commonly with chips (fries), in naan bread or in pita bread. German Doner Kebab is a Glasgow-based chain operating 100 restaurants in the UK, which specialises in the dish.[59] A variation known as donair was introduced in Halifax, Nova Scotia, in the early 1970s.[24] There are competing claims about the origin, but according to Halifax resident Leo Gamoulakos, his father, Greek immigrant Peter Gamoulakos, started selling Greek-style gyros at Velos Pizza in the Halifax suburb of Bedford. It did not catch on with the public, so in 1972[24] he modified the customary pork and lamb recipe by using spiced ground beef, Lebanese flatbread, and inventing the distinctive sweet donair sauce made with condensed milk, vinegar, sugar, and garlic. He called it by the doner name rather than gyros, but it came to be pronounced, and spelled, as donair.[60][61][62] In 1973 Gamoulakos opened the first King of Donair restaurant on Quinpool Road in Halifax.[63] In 2015, Halifax named donair the city's official food.[25] Historically found only in Atlantic Canada, the dish's popularity has expanded to other parts of Canada in various forms.[64][60] Al pastor is a variation of d\u00f6ner kebab via Lebanese shawarma. Literally \"in the style of the shepherd\", it references the lamb often used in shawarma, though it is normally made with pork.[65] Doner kebab is best known in the United States in its Greek variation, now known as gyros. Numerous people have made competing claims to have introduced the dish sometime in the 1960s, and its mass-production in the 1970s.[66] Originally known in Greece as \u03bd\u03c4\u03bf\u03bd\u03ad\u03c1 (doner), by 1970 in the United States the newly coined name gyros was commonly in use,[67][68] though it was still known in some Greek restaurants by both names into the 1970s.[69][23] It was also available, possibly later, in some Turkish restaurants.[70][71][72] In recent years a number of restaurants and food trucks specializing in d\u00f6ner kebab have opened in various parts of the country; a substantial percentage are owned by German immigrants.[73][74] With a multicultural population, the doner kebab in Australia competes with the Greek gyros and the Lebanese shawarma.[75] Kebab sellers are subject to strict government food safety regulations.[76] A halal snack pack is a dish that originated in Australia. It consists of halal-certified doner kebab meat, chips (french fries), and sauces such as chili, garlic and barbecue. It is traditionally served in a styrofoam container, and has been described as a staple dish of takeaway kebab shops in Australia.[77][78] The name of the dish was selected by the Macquarie Dictionary as the \"People's choice Word of the Year\" for 2016.[79] Health concerns regarding d\u00f6ner kebab, including the hygiene involved in overnight storage and re-heating of partially cooked meat, its quality, as well as high salt, fat, and calorie levels, have been reported in the media.[80][81][82] Some investigations have found poor-quality ingredients in d\u00f6ner kebab meat, or meat types other than what was advertised.[83][84] Food safety regulations in most developed countries address the dangers of bacteria in undercooked meat of all kinds sold to the public. Some have guidelines specific to d\u00f6ner kebab handling and preparation. Following several outbreaks of E. coli food poisoning, the Canadian government in 2008 introduced a number of recommendations, including that the meat should be cooked a second time after being sliced from the rotisserie.[85] In Germany, any d\u00f6ner kebab meat placed onto the rotisserie must be sold the same day. It is a violation of health regulations to freeze partially cooked meat for sale at a later date.[86] Hot", "Murgh Makhani": "Butter chicken, traditionally known as murgh makhani (pronounced [m\u028ar\u0263 \u02c8m\u0259k\u02b0a\u02d0ni]), is an Indian dish originating in Delhi.[1][2] It is a type of curry made from chicken with a spiced tomato and butter (makhan) sauce. Its sauce is known for its rich texture. It is similar to chicken tikka masala, which uses a tomato paste.[6] The curry was developed at the Moti Mahal restaurant in the Daryaganj neighbourhood of Old Delhi in the 1950s, after the Partition of India[7] by Kundan Lal Jaggi and Kundan Lal Gujral,[8] who were both Punjabi refugees from Peshawar.[9][10][2] The curry was made \"by chance\" by mixing leftover tandoori chicken in a tomato gravy, rich in butter (makhan).[11] In 1974, a recipe was published for \"Murgh makhanii (Tandoori chicken cooked in butter and tomato sauce)\".[citation needed] In 1975, the English phrase \"butter chicken\" curry first appeared in print, as a specialty of the house at Gaylord Indian restaurant in Manhattan.[12] In Toronto and the Caribbean, it can be found as a filling in pizza, poutine, wraps, roti, or rolls,[13] while in Australia and New Zealand, it is also eaten as a pie filling.[14][15][16][17] The curry is common in India, Bangladesh, Pakistan, and many other countries where a South Asian diaspora is present.[18][19][13][20][21] Due to its popularity outside of India, it is sometimes mistakenly believed to be of Western origin (like chicken tikka masala, which it is also sometimes confused with).[22] In 2024, the family of Gujral (who run Moti Mahal) sued the family of Jaggi (who run a rival restaurant) in a dispute over credit for inventing the dish.[23] Chicken is marinated for several hours in a mixture of lemon juice, dahi (yogurt), Kashmiri red chili, salt, garam masala, ginger paste, and garlic paste. The marinated chicken is cooked in a tandoor (traditional clay oven), but may be grilled, oven-roasted, or pan-fried. It is served in a mild curry sauce that includes butter. The sauce is a tomato, garlic, and ginger-based sauce that is simmered until smooth and much of the water has evaporated. There are many variations on the composition and spicing of the sauce, which is sieved so that it is velvety smooth. Spices may include cardamom, cumin, cloves, cinnamon, coriander, pepper, garam masala, and fenugreek (Punjabi/Hindi: kasuri methi). Cashew paste may be used as a thickener and it is finally garnished with coriander.", "Murgh Musallam": "Murgh musallam (whole chicken) is a Mughlai dish originating from the Indian subcontinent.[1] It consists of  whole chicken marinated in a ginger-garlic paste, stuffed with boiled eggs and seasoned with spices like saffron, cinnamon, cloves, poppy seeds, cardamom and chilli. It is cooked dry or in sauce, and decorated with almonds and silver leaves.[2] Murgh musallam literally means 'whole chicken'.[2] The dish was popular among the royal Mughal families of Awadh, now  the state of Uttar Pradesh in India. It also means well done. \nIbn Battuta described Murgh Musallam as a favourite dish of Muhammad bin Tughluq.[3] The dish was also served in the Delhi Sultanate.[4] Hot", "Sheer Khurma": " Sheer khurma or sheer khorma (Persian: \u0634\u064a\u0631 \u062e\u0631\u0645\u0627, romanized:\u00a0sh\u00eer xorm\u00e2 \"milk and dates\")[1] is a festival vermicelli pudding prepared by Muslims on Eid ul-Fitr[2][3] and Eid al-Adha in  Pakistan, Afghanistan, and parts of Central Asia. It is equivalent to shemai, a Bangladeshi dessert. It is a traditional Muslim festive breakfast,[a] and a dessert for celebrations. This dish is made from various dry fruits, vermicelli, condensed milk, sugar etc. Depending on the region, cardamom, pistachios, almonds, cloves, saffron, raisins, and rose water are also added. This special dish is served on the morning of Eid day in the family after the Eid prayer as breakfast, and throughout the day to all the visiting guests. In its original form, it consists of dates mixed with milk[1] from Iran and dry fruits and nuts from Afghanistan which is where it originated.[5] It is modified in India by the addition of fried semia and caramelised sugar.[5] The main ingredients used in sheer khurma are vermicelli, whole milk, sugar and dates.[6] Depending on the region, cardamom, pistachios, almonds, cloves, saffron, raisins, and rose water are also added.[7] Vermicelli are fried in clarified butter.[8] Then milk (sheer) is added and the vermicelli are allowed to cook further.[8] As the mixture thickens, sugar and dates are added along with any other dried fruits.[8] In some areas locals opt to use a higher milk to vermicelli ratio because they prefer a thinner drink like consistency[9]  This Indian cuisine\u2013related article is a stub.
